  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有两阶段设计流程在解决方案质量和计算效率方面存在不足，需要更高效的联合优化方法。

Method: 使用LLM提取结构化设计约束，编码到基于Modulor的网格表示中，采用从粗到细的优化策略，考虑走廊连通性、房间可达性等关键设计需求。

Result: 在多样化场景中的实验表明，该方法在解决方案质量上显著优于现有两阶段设计流程，并通过从粗到细策略实现了显著的计算效率提升。

Conclusion: 该联合优化框架为自动化室内设计提供了高质量且计算高效的解决方案，优于传统的分阶段方法。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for automated interior design that combines large language models (LLMs) with grid-based integer programming to jointly optimize room layout and furniture placement. Given a textual prompt, the LLM-driven agent workflow extracts structured design constraints related to room configurations and furniture arrangements. These constraints are encoded into a unified grid-based representation inspired by ``Modulor". Our formulation accounts for key design requirements, including corridor connectivity, room accessibility, spatial exclusivity, and user-specified preferences. To improve computational efficiency, we adopt a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy that begins with a low-resolution grid to solve a simplified problem and guides the solution at the full resolution. Experimental results across diverse scenarios demonstrate that our joint optimization approach significantly outperforms existing two-stage design pipelines in solution quality, and achieves notable computational efficiency through the coarse-to-fine strategy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 道路状况对日常通勤至关重要，随着车辆数量增加，需要频繁评估道路状况以确保交通顺畅，即使是小裂缝也可能发展成大坑洼

Method: 利用车载传感器收集数据，使用支持向量机（SVM）分类器来检测坑洼

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效实时检测道路坑洼，为大规模坑洼管理和分析提供有用数据

Abstract: Road conditions play an important role in our everyday commute. With the proliferating number of vehicles on the road each year, it has become necessary to access the road conditions very frequently, this would ensure that the traffic also flows smoothly. Even the smallest crack in the road could be easily be chipped into a large pothole due to changing surface temperatures of the road and from the force of vehicles riding over it. In this paper, we have addressed how we could better identify these potholes in realtime with the help of onboard sensors in vehicles so that the data could be useful for analysis and better management of potholes on a large scale. For the implementation, we used an SVM classifier to detect potholes, we achieved 98.1% accuracy based on data collected from a local road for about 2 km which had 26 potholes distributed along the road.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强现实管道中缺乏实时颜色协调解决方案，需要支持设备端推理的轻量级方法

Result: 在真实AR合成图像上，该方法获得了最佳综合得分

Conclusion: 提出的MKL-Harmonizer算法在AR颜色协调任务中表现优异，并发布了专用数据集和工具包

Abstract: Color harmonization adjusts the colors of an inserted object so that it perceptually matches the surrounding image, resulting in a seamless composite. The harmonization problem naturally arises in augmented reality (AR), yet harmonization algorithms are not currently integrated into AR pipelines because real-time solutions are scarce. In this work, we address color harmonization for AR by proposing a lightweight approach that supports on-device inference. For this, we leverage classical optimal transport theory by training a compact encoder to predict the Monge-Kantorovich transport map. We benchmark our MKL-Harmonizer algorithm against state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate that for real composite AR images our method achieves the best aggregated score. We release our dedicated AR dataset of composite images with pixel-accurate masks and data-gathering toolkit to support further data acquisition by researchers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前耕地生态系统缺乏标准化的栖息地分类系统，栖息地类型覆盖不完整，现有模型无法有效整合语义和纹理特征，导致多尺度栖息地分割精度不足和边界模糊。

Abstract: Addressing the current lack of a standardized habitat classification system for cultivated land ecosystems, incomplete coverage of habitat types, and the inability of existing models to effectively integrate semantic and texture features-resulting in insufficient segmentation accuracy and blurred boundaries for multi-scale habitats (e.g., large-scale field plots and micro-habitats)-this study developed a comprehensively annotated ultra-high-resolution remote sensing image dataset encompassing 15 categories of cultivated land system habitats. Furthermore, we propose a Dynamic-Weighted Feature Fusion Network (DWFF-Net). The encoder of this model utilizes a frozen-parameter DINOv3 to extract foundational features. By analyzing the relationships between different category images and feature maps, we introduce a data-level adaptive dynamic weighting strategy for feature fusion. The decoder incorporates a dynamic weight computation network to achieve thorough integration of multi-layer features, and a hybrid loss function is adopted to optimize model training. Experimental results on the constructed dataset demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.6979 and an F1-score of 0.8049, outperforming the baseline network by 0.021 and 0.0161, respectively. Ablation studies further confirm the complementary nature of multi-layer feature fusion, which effectively improves the IoU for micro-habitat categories such as field ridges. This study establishes a habitat identification framework for cultivated land systems based on adaptive multi-layer feature fusion, enabling sub-meter precision habitat mapping at a low cost and providing robust technical support for fine-grained habitat monitoring in cultivated landscapes.

### [6] [PFAvatar: Pose-Fusion 3D Personalized Avatar Reconstruction from Real-World Outfit-of-the-Day Photos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12935)
*Dianbing Xi,Guoyuan An,Jingsen Zhu,Zhijian Liu,Yuan Liu,Ruiyuan Zhang,Jiayuan Lu,Rui Wang,Yuchi Huo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PFAvatar是一种从"每日穿搭"照片重建高质量3D虚拟形象的新方法，通过两阶段流程：基于姿态感知扩散模型的少样本微调和NeRF表示的3D虚拟形象蒸馏，实现了快速个性化（5分钟）和高保真重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要将图像分割为服装、配饰等组件进行3D组装，容易导致不一致性，且难以处理多样姿态、遮挡和复杂背景的"每日穿搭"照片。

Method: 第一阶段：集成预训练ControlNet进行姿态估计，使用条件先验保持损失进行端到端学习；第二阶段：基于NeRF的虚拟形象表示，通过规范SMPL-X空间采样和多分辨率3D-SDS优化。

Result: 相比现有方法实现48倍加速，在重建保真度、细节保持和遮挡/截断鲁棒性方面优于最先进方法，支持虚拟试穿、动画和视频重演等下游应用。

Conclusion: PFAvatar避免了分解方法的不一致性，通过连续辐射场保持高频纹理并正确处理遮挡，推进了从真实世界"每日穿搭"相册生成实用3D虚拟形象的进程。

Abstract: We propose PFAvatar (Pose-Fusion Avatar), a new method that reconstructs high-quality 3D avatars from ``Outfit of the Day'' (OOTD) photos, which exhibit diverse poses, occlusions, and complex backgrounds. Our method consists of two stages: (1) fine-tuning a pose-aware diffusion model from few-shot OOTD examples and (2) distilling a 3D avatar represented by a neural radiance field (NeRF). In the first stage, unlike previous methods that segment images into assets (e.g., garments, accessories) for 3D assembly, which is prone to inconsistency, we avoid decomposition and directly model the full-body appearance. By integrating a pre-trained ControlNet for pose estimation and a novel Condition Prior Preservation Loss (CPPL), our method enables end-to-end learning of fine details while mitigating language drift in few-shot training. Our method completes personalization in just 5 minutes, achieving a 48$\times$ speed-up compared to previous approaches. In the second stage, we introduce a NeRF-based avatar representation optimized by canonical SMPL-X space sampling and Multi-Resolution 3D-SDS. Compared to mesh-based representations that suffer from resolution-dependent discretization and erroneous occluded geometry, our continuous radiance field can preserve high-frequency textures (e.g., hair) and handle occlusions correctly through transmittance. Experiments demonstrate that PFAvatar outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction fidelity, detail preservation, and robustness to occlusions/truncations, advancing practical 3D avatar generation from real-world OOTD albums. In addition, the reconstructed 3D avatar supports downstream applications such as virtual try-on, animation, and human video reenactment, further demonstrating the versatility and practical value of our approach.

### [7] [AGENet: Adaptive Edge-aware Geodesic Distance Learning for Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11662)
*Ziyuan Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AGENet是一个用于医学图像分割的新框架，通过边缘感知测地距离学习结合空间关系，在有限标注数据下实现精确边界分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割需要大量标注数据，现有少样本分割方法在医学图像边界分割上表现不佳，特别是当解剖结构相似且缺乏足够空间上下文时。

Method: 结合三个主要组件：边缘感知测地距离学习模块（通过迭代快速行进细化）、自适应原型提取（通过空间加权聚合捕获全局结构和局部边界细节）、自适应参数学习（自动适应不同器官特征）。

Result: 在多个医学影像数据集上的广泛实验显示优于现有最先进方法，显著减少边界误差同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: 该方法非常适合需要精确分割但标注数据有限的临床应用，通过轻量级几何建模实现了更好的边界分割性能。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation requires large annotated datasets, creating a significant bottleneck for clinical applications. While few-shot segmentation methods can learn from minimal examples, existing approaches demonstrate suboptimal performance in precise boundary delineation for medical images, particularly when anatomically similar regions appear without sufficient spatial context. We propose AGENet (Adaptive Geodesic Edge-aware Network), a novel framework that incorporates spatial relationships through edge-aware geodesic distance learning. Our key insight is that medical structures follow predictable geometric patterns that can guide prototype extraction even with limited training data. Unlike methods relying on complex architectural components or heavy neural networks, our approach leverages computationally lightweight geometric modeling. The framework combines three main components: (1) An edge-aware geodesic distance learning module that respects anatomical boundaries through iterative Fast Marching refinement, (2) adaptive prototype extraction that captures both global structure and local boundary details via spatially-weighted aggregation, and (3) adaptive parameter learning that automatically adjusts to different organ characteristics. Extensive experiments across diverse medical imaging datasets demonstrate improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our method reduces boundary errors compared to existing approaches while maintaining computational efficiency, making it highly suitable for clinical applications requiring precise segmentation with limited annotated data.

### [8] [SymGS : Leveraging Local Symmetries for 3D Gaussian Splatting Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13264)
*Keshav Gupta,Akshat Sanghvi,Shreyas Reddy Palley,Astitva Srivastava,Charu Sharma,Avinash Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SymGS是一个3D高斯溅射压缩框架，通过引入可学习镜像来消除局部和全局的反射冗余，实现108倍的压缩率，同时保持渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射技术在渲染速度和真实感方面表现出色，但其内存占用随场景复杂度快速增长，现有压缩方法主要利用基元级冗余进行压缩，但仍有提升空间。

Method: 提出SymGS框架，引入可学习镜像来识别和消除场景中的对称冗余，可作为即插即用模块增强现有压缩方法（如HAC）。

Result: 相比HAC方法，在基准数据集上实现1.66倍压缩（大规模场景可达3倍），平均实现108倍的3DGS场景压缩，同时保持渲染质量。

Conclusion: SymGS通过对称感知技术有效突破了现有压缩方法的限制，为3D高斯溅射提供了高效的压缩解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a transformative technique in novel view synthesis, primarily due to its high rendering speed and photorealistic fidelity. However, its memory footprint scales rapidly with scene complexity, often reaching several gigabytes. Existing methods address this issue by introducing compression strategies that exploit primitive-level redundancy through similarity detection and quantization. We aim to surpass the compression limits of such methods by incorporating symmetry-aware techniques, specifically targeting mirror symmetries to eliminate redundant primitives. We propose a novel compression framework, \textbf{\textit{SymGS}}, introducing learnable mirrors into the scene, thereby eliminating local and global reflective redundancies for compression. Our framework functions as a plug-and-play enhancement to state-of-the-art compression methods, (e.g. HAC) to achieve further compression. Compared to HAC, we achieve $1.66 \times$ compression across benchmark datasets (upto $3\times$ on large-scale scenes). On an average, SymGS enables $\bf{108\times}$ compression of a 3DGS scene, while preserving rendering quality.

*Jiahui Wang,Haiyue Zhu,Haoren Guo,Abdullah Al Mamun,Cheng Xiang,Tong Heng Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出EPSegFZ网络，无需预训练即可实现少样本和零样本3D点云语义分割，通过原型增强注意力、双相对位置编码和语言引导原型嵌入模块提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本3D点云分割方法过度依赖预训练阶段，限制了模型灵活性；同时未能充分利用支持集中的文本注释等有用信息，影响了模型性能和零样本能力。

Method: 使用Prototype-Enhanced Registers Attention模块和Dual Relative Positional Encoding交叉注意力机制改进特征提取；引入Language-Guided Prototype Embedding模块利用文本信息提升少样本性能并实现零样本推理。

Result: 在S3DIS和ScanNet基准测试中分别比现有最优方法提升5.68%和3.82%。

Conclusion: EPSegFZ无需预训练即可实现高效的少样本和零样本3D点云语义分割，通过充分利用视觉和文本信息显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Recent approaches for few-shot 3D point cloud semantic segmentation typically require a two-stage learning process, i.e., a pre-training stage followed by a few-shot training stage. While effective, these methods face overreliance on pre-training, which hinders model flexibility and adaptability. Some models tried to avoid pre-training yet failed to capture ample information. In addition, current approaches focus on visual information in the support set and neglect or do not fully exploit other useful data, such as textual annotations. This inadequate utilization of support information impairs the performance of the model and restricts its zero-shot ability. To address these limitations, we present a novel pre-training-free network, named Efficient Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation for Few- and Zero-shot scenarios. Our EPSegFZ incorporates three key components. A Prototype-Enhanced Registers Attention (ProERA) module and a Dual Relative Positional Encoding (DRPE)-based cross-attention mechanism for improved feature extraction and accurate query-prototype correspondence construction without pre-training. A Language-Guided Prototype Embedding (LGPE) module that effectively leverages textual information from the support set to improve few-shot performance and enable zero-shot inference. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 5.68% and 3.82% on the S3DIS and ScanNet benchmarks, respectively.

*Lian He,Meng Liu,Qilang Ye,Yu Zhou,Xiang Deng,Gangyi Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TASA是一个新颖的几何优化框架，用于3D场景级可操作性分割，通过联合利用2D语义线索和3D几何推理，在准确性和效率上显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注对象级可操作性或将2D预测提升到3D，忽略了点云中的丰富几何结构信息且计算成本高。需要解决语义推理和空间定位的挑战。

Method: TASA采用从粗到细的方法：1）任务感知的2D可操作性检测模块识别可操作点；2）3D可操作性细化模块将2D语义先验与局部3D几何信息集成。

Result: 在SceneFun3D数据集上的实验表明，TASA在场景级可操作性分割的准确性和效率方面显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: TASA通过联合利用2D语义和3D几何信息，有效解决了3D场景级可操作性分割的挑战，在准确性和效率方面都取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Understanding 3D scene-level affordances from natural language instructions is essential for enabling embodied agents to interact meaningfully in complex environments. However, this task remains challenging due to the need for semantic reasoning and spatial grounding. Existing methods mainly focus on object-level affordances or merely lift 2D predictions to 3D, neglecting rich geometric structure information in point clouds and incurring high computational costs. To address these limitations, we introduce Task-Aware 3D Scene-level Affordance segmentation (TASA), a novel geometry-optimized framework that jointly leverages 2D semantic cues and 3D geometric reasoning in a coarse-to-fine manner. To improve the affordance detection efficiency, TASA features a task-aware 2D affordance detection module to identify manipulable points from language and visual inputs, guiding the selection of task-relevant views. To fully exploit 3D geometric information, a 3D affordance refinement module is proposed to integrate 2D semantic priors with local 3D geometry, resulting in accurate and spatially coherent 3D affordance masks. Experiments on SceneFun3D demonstrate that TASA significantly outperforms the baselines in both accuracy and efficiency in scene-level affordance segmentation.

### [11] [LE-CapsNet: A Light and Enhanced Capsule Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11708)
*Pouya Shiri,Amirali Baniasadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了LE-CapsNet，一种轻量、增强且更准确的CapsNet变体，在CIFAR-10上达到76.73%准确率，推理速度比CapsNet快4倍，在AffNIST上达到94.3%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CapsNet虽然具有检测重叠类别图像和变换图像的优势，但速度慢、资源消耗大、参数多且准确率不如CNN。

Method: 开发了LE-CapsNet作为CapsNet的轻量增强版本，使用380万权重参数。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上达到76.73%准确率，推理速度比CapsNet快4倍；在AffNIST数据集上达到94.3%准确率，优于CapsNet的90.52%。

Conclusion: LE-CapsNet在保持CapsNet优势的同时，显著提升了效率和准确率，对仿射变换图像具有更强的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Capsule Network (CapsNet) classifier has several advantages over CNNs, including better detection of images containing overlapping categories and higher accuracy on transformed images. Despite the advantages, CapsNet is slow due to its different structure. In addition, CapsNet is resource-hungry, includes many parameters and lags in accuracy compared to CNNs. In this work, we propose LE-CapsNet as a light, enhanced and more accurate variant of CapsNet. Using 3.8M weights, LECapsNet obtains 76.73% accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset while performing inference 4x faster than CapsNet. In addition, our proposed network is more robust at detecting images with affine transformations compared to CapsNet. We achieve 94.3% accuracy on the AffNIST dataset (compared to CapsNet 90.52%).

### [12] [Target-Balanced Score Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11710)
*Zhou Xu,Qi Wang,Yuxiao Yang,Luyuan Zhang,Zhang Liang,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Target-Balanced Score Distillation (TBSD)方法，通过多目标优化和自适应策略解决了SDS在3D资产生成中纹理保真度与形状准确性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Score Distillation Sampling (SDS)在3D资产生成中存在过饱和和过平滑问题，而引入负提示的变体方法面临纹理优化有限或纹理提升但形状失真的关键权衡。

Method: 首先系统分析了负提示利用对权衡的影响，发现目标负提示(TNP)能显著提升纹理真实性和保真度但会导致形状失真。基于此，提出了TBSD方法，将生成建模为多目标优化问题，并引入自适应策略。

Result: 大量实验表明，TBSD显著优于现有最先进方法，能够生成具有高保真纹理和几何精确形状的3D资产。

Conclusion: TBSD通过平衡纹理保真度和形状准确性，有效解决了SDS方法中的关键权衡问题，为3D资产生成提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) enables 3D asset generation by distilling priors from pretrained 2D text-to-image diffusion models, but vanilla SDS suffers from over-saturation and over-smoothing. To mitigate this issue, recent variants have incorporated negative prompts. However, these methods face a critical trade-off: limited texture optimization, or significant texture gains with shape distortion. In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis and reveal that this trade-off is fundamentally governed by the utilization of the negative prompts, where Target Negative Prompts (TNP) that embed target information in the negative prompts dramatically enhancing texture realism and fidelity but inducing shape distortions. Informed by this key insight, we introduce the Target-Balanced Score Distillation (TBSD). It formulates generation as a multi-objective optimization problem and introduces an adaptive strategy that effectively resolves the aforementioned trade-off. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TBSD significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, yielding 3D assets with high-fidelity textures and geometrically accurate shape.

*Sudhakar Sah,Nikhil Chabbra,Matthieu Durnerin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompressNAS是一个受MicroNAS启发的框架，将秩选择作为全局搜索问题来处理，通过快速精度估计器评估候选分解，在内存和精度约束下实现高效而详尽的秩探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于深度卷积神经网络（CNN）在微控制器（MCU）和轻量级NPU上的部署难度增加，需要有效的压缩方法。现有方法在秩选择上存在局部性和忽略全局权衡的问题。

Method: 采用低秩张量分解（如Tucker分解），将秩选择作为全局搜索问题，使用快速精度估计器评估候选分解，实现高效的秩探索。

Result: 在ImageNet上，将ResNet-18压缩8倍，精度下降小于4%；在COCO上，YOLOv5s实现2倍压缩且无精度损失，YOLOv5n实现2倍压缩且精度下降2.5%。提出了新的压缩模型家族STResNet，性能与其他高效模型相当。

Conclusion: CompressNAS框架能够有效平衡压缩与精度，为在资源受限设备上部署深度CNN提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are increasingly difficult to deploy on microcontrollers (MCUs) and lightweight NPUs (Neural Processing Units) due to their growing size and compute demands. Low-rank tensor decomposition, such as Tucker factorization, is a promising way to reduce parameters and operations with reasonable accuracy loss. However, existing approaches select ranks locally and often ignore global trade-offs between compression and accuracy. We introduce CompressNAS, a MicroNAS-inspired framework that treats rank selection as a global search problem. CompressNAS employs a fast accuracy estimator to evaluate candidate decompositions, enabling efficient yet exhaustive rank exploration under memory and accuracy constraints. In ImageNet, CompressNAS compresses ResNet-18 by 8x with less than 4% accuracy drop; on COCO, we achieve 2x compression of YOLOv5s without any accuracy drop and 2x compression of YOLOv5n with a 2.5% drop. Finally, we present a new family of compressed models, STResNet, with competitive performance compared to other efficient models.

*Jiao Chen,Haoyi Wang,Jianhua Tang,Junyi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaptFly是一个无需权重更新的提示引导测试时适应框架，通过轻量级token提示检索和梯度稀疏视觉提示优化，解决无人机在恶劣天气和光照条件下的语义分割性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低空无人机网络的语义分割模型在天气、光照和视角变化下性能快速下降，资源受限的无人机无法运行基于梯度的测试时适应，而资源充足的无人机独立适应会浪费共享经验。

Method: AdaptFly采用两种互补适应模式：资源受限无人机使用轻量级token提示检索共享全局记忆；资源充足无人机使用协方差矩阵自适应进化策略进行梯度稀疏视觉提示优化。激活统计检测器触发适应，跨无人机知识池整合提示知识。

Result: 在UAVid和VDD基准测试以及真实无人机部署中的实验表明，AdaptFly显著提高了分割精度和鲁棒性，优于静态模型和最先进的TTA基线方法。

Conclusion: AdaptFly为新兴低空经济中的弹性、通信高效感知提供了一条实用路径，通过跨无人机协作实现高效的知识共享和适应。

Abstract: Low-altitude Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks rely on robust semantic segmentation as a foundational enabler for distributed sensing-communication-control co-design across heterogeneous agents within the network. However, segmentation foundation models deteriorate quickly under weather, lighting, and viewpoint drift. Resource-limited UAVs cannot run gradient-based test-time adaptation, while resource-massive UAVs adapt independently, wasting shared experience. To address these challenges, we propose AdaptFly, a prompt-guided test-time adaptation framework that adjusts segmentation models without weight updates. AdaptFly features two complementary adaptation modes. For resource-limited UAVs, it employs lightweight token-prompt retrieval from a shared global memory. For resource-massive UAVs, it uses gradient-free sparse visual prompt optimization via Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy. An activation-statistic detector triggers adaptation, while cross-UAV knowledge pool consolidates prompt knowledge and enables fleet-wide collaboration with negligible bandwidth overhead. Extensive experiments on UAVid and VDD benchmarks, along with real-world UAV deployments under diverse weather conditions, demonstrate that AdaptFly significantly improves segmentation accuracy and robustness over static models and state-of-the-art TTA baselines. The results highlight a practical path to resilient, communication-efficient perception in the emerging low-altitude economy.

Abstract: Typically, children start to learn their first words between 6 and 9 months, linking spoken utterances to their visual referents. Without prior knowledge, a word encountered for the first time can be interpreted in countless ways; it might refer to any of the objects in the environment, their components, or attributes. Using longitudinal, egocentric, and ecologically valid data from the experience of one child, in this work, we propose a self-supervised and biologically plausible strategy to learn strong visual representations. Our masked autoencoder-based visual backbone incorporates knowledge about the blind spot in human eyes to define a novel masking strategy. This mask and reconstruct approach attempts to mimic the way the human brain fills the gaps in the eyes' field of view. This represents a significant shift from standard random masking strategies, which are difficult to justify from a biological perspective. The pretrained encoder is utilized in a contrastive learning-based video-text model capable of acquiring word-referent mappings. Extensive evaluation suggests that the proposed biologically plausible masking strategy is at least as effective as random masking for learning word-referent mappings from cross-situational and temporally extended episodes.

TL;DR: GROVER是一个新颖的空间多组学数据融合框架，通过图卷积网络和对比学习解决多模态数据整合的挑战，在真实数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间多组学数据（转录组、蛋白质组、表观基因组）缺乏病理形态学背景，需要与组织病理图像整合以全面分析疾病组织。但不同组学、成像和空间模态之间存在显著异质性，简单的融合会导致模糊表示，分辨率不匹配和生物扰动进一步阻碍准确整合。

Method: GROVER采用基于Kolmogorov-Arnold网络的图卷积网络编码器捕捉模态间非线性依赖关系，生成模态特定嵌入；使用spot-feature-pair对比学习策略显式优化跨模态对应关系；设计动态专家路由机制自适应选择信息丰富的模态并抑制噪声输入。

Result: 在真实世界空间组学数据集上的实验表明，GROVER优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: GROVER为多模态整合提供了一个稳健可靠的解决方案，能够有效应对空间多组学数据整合中的挑战。

Abstract: Effectively modeling multimodal spatial omics data is critical for understanding tissue complexity and underlying biological mechanisms. While spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, and epigenomics capture molecular features, they lack pathological morphological context. Integrating these omics with histopathological images is therefore essential for comprehensive disease tissue analysis. However, substantial heterogeneity across omics, imaging, and spatial modalities poses significant challenges. Naive fusion of semantically distinct sources often leads to ambiguous representations. Additionally, the resolution mismatch between high-resolution histology images and lower-resolution sequencing spots complicates spatial alignment. Biological perturbations during sample preparation further distort modality-specific signals, hindering accurate integration. To address these challenges, we propose Graph-guided Representation of Omics and Vision with Expert Regulation for Adaptive Spatial Multi-omics Fusion (GROVER), a novel framework for adaptive integration of spatial multi-omics data. GROVER leverages a Graph Convolutional Network encoder based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to capture the nonlinear dependencies between each modality and its associated spatial structure, thereby producing expressive, modality-specific embeddings. To align these representations, we introduce a spot-feature-pair contrastive learning strategy that explicitly optimizes the correspondence across modalities at each spot. Furthermore, we design a dynamic expert routing mechanism that adaptively selects informative modalities for each spot while suppressing noisy or low-quality inputs. Experiments on real-world spatial omics datasets demonstrate that GROVER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, providing a robust and reliable solution for multimodal integration.

TL;DR: HSI-Detect通过将RGB图像重建为31通道高光谱图像，在高光谱域进行Deepfake检测，比仅使用RGB的方法效果更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代生成和扩散模型产生的图像高度逼真，可能误导人类感知和自动化检测系统。大多数检测方法只在RGB空间操作，仅分析三个光谱通道。

Method: 提出HSI-Detect两阶段流程：从标准RGB输入重建31通道高光谱图像，然后在高光谱域进行检测。扩展输入表示到更密集的光谱带可以放大RGB域中弱或不可见的操作伪影。

Result: 在FaceForensics++数据集上评估，相比仅使用RGB的基线方法显示出持续改进。

Conclusion: 光谱域映射在Deepfake检测中具有前景。

Abstract: Modern generative and diffusion models produce highly realistic images that can mislead human perception and even sophisticated automated detection systems. Most detection methods operate in RGB space and thus analyze only three spectral channels. We propose HSI-Detect, a two-stage pipeline that reconstructs a 31-channel hyperspectral image from a standard RGB input and performs detection in the hyperspectral domain. Expanding the input representation into denser spectral bands amplifies manipulation artifacts that are often weak or invisible in the RGB domain, particularly in specific frequency bands. We evaluate HSI-Detect across FaceForensics++ dataset and show the consistent improvements over RGB-only baselines, illustrating the promise of spectral-domain mapping for Deepfake detection.

Abstract: Many neural networks for point clouds are, by design, invariant to the symmetries of this datatype: permutations and rigid motions. The purpose of this paper is to examine whether such networks preserve natural symmetry aware distances on the point cloud spaces, through the notion of bi-Lipschitz equivalence. This inquiry is motivated by recent work in the Equivariant learning literature which highlights the advantages of bi-Lipschitz models in other scenarios.
  We consider two symmetry aware metrics on point clouds: (a) The Procrustes Matching (PM) metric and (b) Hard Gromov Wasserstien distances. We show that these two distances themselves are not bi-Lipschitz equivalent, and as a corollary deduce that popular invariant networks for point clouds are not bi-Lipschitz with respect to the PM metric. We then show how these networks can be modified so that they do obtain bi-Lipschitz guarantees. Finally, we provide initial experiments showing the advantage of the proposed bi-Lipschitz model over standard invariant models, for the tasks of finding correspondences between 3D point clouds.

TL;DR: Concept-RuleNet是一个多代理系统，通过视觉概念挖掘和符号推理，在保持透明推理的同时增强视觉基础，提高神经符号方法的性能并减少幻觉符号。

Conclusion: Concept-RuleNet通过视觉基础的概念挖掘和符号推理，在保持透明性的同时显著提升了神经符号方法的性能，有效减少了幻觉问题。

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) deliver impressive predictive accuracy yet offer little insight into 'why' a decision is reached, frequently hallucinating facts, particularly when encountering out-of-distribution data. Neurosymbolic frameworks address this by pairing black-box perception with interpretable symbolic reasoning, but current methods extract their symbols solely from task labels, leaving them weakly grounded in the underlying visual data. In this paper, we introduce a multi-agent system - Concept-RuleNet that reinstates visual grounding while retaining transparent reasoning. Specifically, a multimodal concept generator first mines discriminative visual concepts directly from a representative subset of training images. Next, these visual concepts are utilized to condition symbol discovery, anchoring the generations in real image statistics and mitigating label bias. Subsequently, symbols are composed into executable first-order rules by a large language model reasoner agent - yielding interpretable neurosymbolic rules. Finally, during inference, a vision verifier agent quantifies the degree of presence of each symbol and triggers rule execution in tandem with outputs of black-box neural models, predictions with explicit reasoning pathways. Experiments on five benchmarks, including two challenging medical-imaging tasks and three underrepresented natural-image datasets, show that our system augments state-of-the-art neurosymbolic baselines by an average of 5% while also reducing the occurrence of hallucinated symbols in rules by up to 50%.

Method: 采用隐式稀疏风格，实现针对重要维度的注意力机制，通过特征选择减少编码器-解码器神经网络架构中的瓶颈大小。

Conclusion: Batch Transformers通过关注重要维度实现了模型复杂度的显著降低，同时在面部识别任务中表现出良好的数据增强能力。

Abstract: A novel Transformer variation architecture is proposed in the implicit sparse style. Unlike "traditional" Transformers, instead of attention to sequential or batch entities in their entirety of whole dimensionality, in the proposed Batch Transformers, attention to the "important" dimensions (primary components) is implemented. In such a way, the "important" dimensions or feature selection allows for a significant reduction of the bottleneck size in the encoder-decoder ANN architectures. The proposed architecture is tested on the synthetic image generation for the face recognition task in the case of the makeup and occlusion data set, allowing for increased variability of the limited original data set.

Conclusion: 强化学习能够赋予AI系统自主分解、重新排序和组合视觉模型的能力，推动向通用视觉助手的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image generation have produced strong single-shot models, yet no individual system reliably executes the long, compositional prompts typical of creative workflows. We introduce Image-POSER, a reflective reinforcement learning framework that (i) orchestrates a diverse registry of pretrained text-to-image and image-to-image experts, (ii) handles long-form prompts end-to-end through dynamic task decomposition, and (iii) supervises alignment at each step via structured feedback from a vision-language model critic. By casting image synthesis and editing as a Markov Decision Process, we learn non-trivial expert pipelines that adaptively combine strengths across models. Experiments show that Image-POSER outperforms baselines, including frontier models, across industry-standard and custom benchmarks in alignment, fidelity, and aesthetics, and is consistently preferred in human evaluations. These results highlight that reinforcement learning can endow AI systems with the capacity to autonomously decompose, reorder, and combine visual models, moving towards general-purpose visual assistants.

Conclusion: SOTFormer通过最小化恒定内存时序变换器，在保持实时性能的同时显著提升了跟踪精度和稳定性

Abstract: Accurate single-object tracking and short-term motion forecasting remain challenging under occlusion, scale variation, and temporal drift, which disrupt the temporal coherence required for real-time perception. We introduce \textbf{SOTFormer}, a minimal constant-memory temporal transformer that unifies object detection, tracking, and short-horizon trajectory prediction within a single end-to-end framework. Unlike prior models with recurrent or stacked temporal encoders, SOTFormer achieves stable identity propagation through a ground-truth-primed memory and a burn-in anchor loss that explicitly stabilizes initialization. A single lightweight temporal-attention layer refines embeddings across frames, enabling real-time inference with fixed GPU memory. On the Mini-LaSOT (20%) benchmark, SOTFormer attains 76.3 AUC and 53.7 FPS (AMP, 4.3 GB VRAM), outperforming transformer baselines such as TrackFormer and MOTRv2 under fast motion, scale change, and occlusion.

Conclusion: 提出的3D几何感知动态图变换器方法能有效提升加工操作序列预测的准确性，证明了融入3D几何信息的重要性。

Abstract: Machining process planning (MP) is inherently complex due to structural and geometrical dependencies among part features and machining operations. A key challenge lies in capturing dynamic interdependencies that evolve with distinct part geometries as operations are performed. Machine learning has been applied to address challenges in MP, such as operation selection and machining sequence prediction. Dynamic graph learning (DGL) has been widely used to model dynamic systems, thanks to its ability to integrate spatio-temporal relationships. However, in MP, while existing DGL approaches can capture these dependencies, they fail to incorporate three-dimensional (3D) geometric information of parts and thus lack domain awareness in predicting machining operation sequences. To address this limitation, we propose MP-GFormer, a 3D-geometry-aware dynamic graph transformer that integrates evolving 3D geometric representations into DGL through an attention mechanism to predict machining operation sequences. Our approach leverages StereoLithography surface meshes representing the 3D geometry of a part after each machining operation, with the boundary representation method used for the initial 3D designs. We evaluate MP-GFormer on a synthesized dataset and demonstrate that the method achieves improvements of 24\% and 36\% in accuracy for main and sub-operation predictions, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练模型和开放存储库的快速扩散使得模型合并成为一种便捷但有风险的做法，未经授权的模型合并侵犯知识产权并破坏模型所有权和问责制。

Method: 第一阶段通过L2正则化优化重新分配任务相关信息，确保重要梯度均匀分布；第二阶段注入结构化扰动以错位任务子空间，破坏损失景观中的曲率兼容性。

Result: 在视觉和语言模型上的广泛实验表明，MergeGuard可将合并模型准确率降低高达90%，而受保护模型的性能损失小于1.5%。

Conclusion: MergeGuard通过重塑模型参数几何形状，使合并模型崩溃为破坏性干扰，同时保持受保护模型完全功能，有效防止未经授权的模型合并。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of pretrained models and open repositories has made model merging a convenient yet risky practice, allowing free-riders to combine fine-tuned models into a new multi-capability model without authorization. Such unauthorized model merging not only violates intellectual property rights but also undermines model ownership and accountability. To address this issue, we present MergeGuard, a proactive dual-stage weight protection framework that disrupts merging compatibility while maintaining task fidelity. In the first stage, we redistribute task-relevant information across layers via L2-regularized optimization, ensuring that important gradients are evenly dispersed. In the second stage, we inject structured perturbations to misalign task subspaces, breaking curvature compatibility in the loss landscape. Together, these stages reshape the model's parameter geometry such that merged models collapse into destructive interference while the protected model remains fully functional. Extensive experiments on both vision (ViT-L-14) and language (Llama2, Gemma2, Mistral) models demonstrate that MergeGuard reduces merged model accuracy by up to 90% with less than 1.5% performance loss on the protected model.

Abstract: Segmentation of medical images constitutes an essential component of medical image analysis, providing the foundation for precise diagnosis and efficient therapeutic interventions in clinical practices. Despite substantial progress, most segmentation models do not explicitly encode boundary information; as a result, making boundary preservation a persistent challenge in medical image segmentation. To address this challenge, we introduce FocusSDF, a novel loss function based on the signed distance functions (SDFs), which redirects the network to concentrate on boundary regions by adaptively assigning higher weights to pixels closer to the lesion or organ boundary, effectively making it boundary aware. To rigorously validate FocusSDF, we perform extensive evaluations against five state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models, including the foundation model MedSAM, using four distance-based loss functions across diverse datasets covering cerebral aneurysm, stroke, liver, and breast tumor segmentation tasks spanning multiple imaging modalities. The experimental results consistently demonstrate the superior performance of FocusSDF over existing distance transform based loss functions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统野生动物调查方法资源密集且受限于后勤挑战，而深度学习目标检测模型在稀疏分布物种（如麝牛）的小数据集上效果有限。需要寻找替代方案来训练稳健的检测模型。

Method: 比较了在真实图像上训练的基线模型与5个零样本和5个少样本模型，这些模型在训练集中逐步加入更多合成图像。评估了不同比例合成图像对检测性能的影响。

Result: 对于零样本模型，添加合成图像提高了检测性能，但随着合成图像超过基线模型训练数据集的100%，性能增长趋于平缓。对于少样本模型，结合真实和合成图像能获得更好的召回率和略高的整体准确率，但这些改进在统计上不显著。

Conclusion: 合成图像在数据稀缺时具有训练准确目标检测模型的潜力，为野生动物监测提供了重要视角，能够监测稀有或难以接近的物种并增加监测频率。该方法可用于在没有真实数据的情况下启动目标检测模型，并随着时间推移获取真实图像来完善模型。

Abstract: Accurate population estimates are essential for wildlife management, providing critical insights into species abundance and distribution. Traditional survey methods, including visual aerial counts and GNSS telemetry tracking, are widely used to monitor muskox populations in Arctic regions. These approaches are resource intensive and constrained by logistical challenges. Advances in remote sensing, artificial intelligence, and high resolution aerial imagery offer promising alternatives for wildlife detection. Yet, the effectiveness of deep learning object detection models (ODMs) is often limited by small datasets, making it challenging to train robust ODMs for sparsely distributed species like muskoxen. This study investigates the integration of synthetic imagery (SI) to supplement limited training data and improve muskox detection in zero shot (ZS) and few-shot (FS) settings. We compared a baseline model trained on real imagery with 5 ZS and 5 FS models that incorporated progressively more SI in the training set. For the ZS models, where no real images were included in the training set, adding SI improved detection performance. As more SI were added, performance in precision, recall and F1 score increased, but eventually plateaued, suggesting diminishing returns when SI exceeded 100% of the baseline model training dataset. For FS models, combining real and SI led to better recall and slightly higher overall accuracy compared to using real images alone, though these improvements were not statistically significant. Our findings demonstrate the potential of SI to train accurate ODMs when data is scarce, offering important perspectives for wildlife monitoring by enabling rare or inaccessible species to be monitored and to increase monitoring frequency. This approach could be used to initiate ODMs without real data and refine it as real images are acquired over time.

Abstract: Vision-language foundation models (VLMs) show promise for diverse imaging tasks but often underperform on medical benchmarks. Prior efforts to improve performance include model finetuning, which requires large domain-specific datasets and significant compute, or manual prompt engineering, which is hard to generalize and often inaccessible to medical institutions seeking to deploy these tools. These challenges motivate interest in approaches that draw on a model's embedded knowledge while abstracting away dependence on human-designed prompts to enable scalable, weight-agnostic performance improvements. To explore this, we adapt the Declarative Self-improving Python (DSPy) framework for structured automated prompt optimization in medical vision-language systems through a comprehensive, formal evaluation. We implement prompting pipelines for five medical imaging tasks across radiology, gastroenterology, and dermatology, evaluating 10 open-source VLMs with four prompt optimization techniques. Optimized pipelines achieved a median relative improvement of 53% over zero-shot prompting baselines, with the largest gains ranging from 300% to 3,400% on tasks where zero-shot performance is low. These results highlight the substantial potential of applying automated prompt optimization to medical AI systems, demonstrating significant gains for vision-based applications requiring accurate clinical image interpretation. By reducing dependence on prompt design to elicit intended outputs, these techniques allow clinicians to focus on patient care and clinical decision-making. Furthermore, our experiments offer scalability and preserve data privacy, demonstrating performance improvement on open-source VLMs. We publicly release our evaluation pipelines to support reproducible research on specialized medical tasks, available at https://github.com/DaneshjouLab/prompt-triage-lab.

Abstract: Medical imaging and multi-modal clinical settings often face the challange of missing modality in their diagnostic pipelines. Existing imputation methods either lack representational capacity or are computationally expensive. We propose PI-NAIM, a novel dual-path architecture that dynamically routes samples to optimized imputation approaches based on missingness complexity. Our framework integrates: (1) intelligent path routing that directs low missingness samples to efficient statistical imputation (MICE) and complex patterns to powerful neural networks (GAIN with temporal analysis); (2) cross-path attention fusion that leverages missingness-aware embeddings to intelligently combine both branches; and (3) end-to-end joint optimization of imputation accuracy and downstream task performance. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-III and multimodal benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving RMSE of 0.108 (vs. baselines' 0.119-0.152) and substantial gains in downstream tasks with an AUROC of 0.812 for mortality prediction. PI-NAIM's modular design enables seamless integration into vision pipelines handling incomplete sensor measurements, missing modalities, or corrupted inputs, providing a unified solution for real-world scenario.

TL;DR: QTSplus是一种轻量级视觉token选择模块，通过动态选择与文本查询最相关的视觉证据来解决长视频理解中的计算和内存问题，显著压缩视觉流并提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在长视频理解中面临的视觉token数量线性增长导致的注意力成本、内存和延迟爆炸问题。

Method: 使用查询感知的token选择器，通过交叉注意力评分视觉token，基于查询复杂度预测保留预算，使用可微分直通估计器选择Top-n token，并通过小型重编码器保持时间顺序。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL中集成后，视觉流压缩达89%，端到端延迟减少28%，在八个长视频理解基准测试中保持接近原始模型的准确率，在TempCompass方向准确率上提升20.5分。

Conclusion: QTSplus是扩展MLLMs到真实世界长视频场景的有效通用机制，在保持任务相关证据的同时显著提升效率。

Abstract: Despite the recent advances in the video understanding ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), long video understanding remains a challenge. One of the main issues is that the number of vision tokens grows linearly with video length, which causes an explosion in attention cost, memory, and latency. To solve this challenge, we present Query-aware Token Selector (\textbf{QTSplus}), a lightweight yet powerful visual token selection module that serves as an information gate between the vision encoder and LLMs. Given a text query and video tokens, QTSplus dynamically selects the most important visual evidence for the input text query by (i) scoring visual tokens via cross-attention, (ii) \emph{predicting} an instance-specific retention budget based on the complexity of the query, and (iii) \emph{selecting} Top-$n$ tokens with a differentiable straight-through estimator during training and a hard gate at inference. Furthermore, a small re-encoder preserves temporal order using absolute time information, enabling second-level localization while maintaining global coverage.
  Integrated into Qwen2.5-VL, QTSplus compresses the vision stream by up to \textbf{89\%} and reduces end-to-end latency by \textbf{28\%} on long videos. The evaluation on eight long video understanding benchmarks shows near-parity accuracy overall when compared with the original Qwen models and outperforms the original model by \textbf{+20.5} and \textbf{+5.6} points respectively on TempCompass direction and order accuracies. These results show that QTSplus is an effective, general mechanism for scaling MLLMs to real-world long-video scenarios while preserving task-relevant evidence.
  We will make all code, data, and trained models' weights publicly available.

TL;DR: 首次使用事件相机进行图像去雾，通过事件引导的扩散模型将高动态范围事件信息传输到RGB图像中，在重度雾霾条件下实现清晰成像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于RGB的去雾方法受限于有限的动态范围，容易丢失结构和光照细节。事件相机具有更高的动态范围和微秒级延迟，更适合雾霾场景。

Method: 提出事件引导的扩散模型，设计事件引导模块将稀疏的高动态范围事件特征映射到扩散潜在空间，在生成过程中提供精确的结构指导。

Result: 在两个基准测试和自建的重度雾霾无人机数据集上取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 事件相机为图像去雾提供了有价值的HDR线索，事件引导的扩散模型能够有效传输这些信息，生成更清晰、更真实的图像。

Abstract: Clear imaging under hazy conditions is a critical task. Prior-based and neural methods have improved results. However, they operate on RGB frames, which suffer from limited dynamic range. Therefore, dehazing remains ill-posed and can erase structure and illumination details. To address this, we use event cameras for dehazing for the \textbf{first time}. Event cameras offer much higher HDR ($120 dBvs.60 dB$) and microsecond latency, therefore they suit hazy scenes. In practice, transferring HDR cues from events to frames is hard because real paired data are scarce. To tackle this, we propose an event-guided diffusion model that utilizes the strong generative priors of diffusion models to reconstruct clear images from hazy inputs by effectively transferring HDR information from events. Specifically, we design an event-guided module that maps sparse HDR event features, \textit{e.g.,} edges, corners, into the diffusion latent space. This clear conditioning provides precise structural guidance during generation, improves visual realism, and reduces semantic drift. For real-world evaluation, we collect a drone dataset in heavy haze (AQI = 341) with synchronized RGB and event sensors. Experiments on two benchmarks and our dataset achieve state-of-the-art results.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了视觉语言模型在细粒度肾小球亚型分类中的表现，发现在仅有4-8个标记样本的情况下，病理学专业化的视觉语言骨干网络结合标准微调是最有效的起点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细粒度肾小球亚型分类对肾脏活检诊断至关重要，但临床上有价值的标签稀缺且难以获取。现有计算方法主要在全监督下进行粗粒度疾病分类，不清楚视觉语言模型如何在数据限制下适应临床有意义的亚型分类。

Method: 将细粒度肾小球亚型分类建模为临床现实的少样本问题，系统评估病理学专业化和通用视觉语言模型，分析分类性能（准确率、AUC、F1）和学习表示的几何特性，包括图像-文本嵌入对齐和肾小球亚型的可分离性。

Result: 病理学专业化视觉语言骨干网络结合标准微调是最有效的起点，即使每个肾小球亚型仅有4-8个标记样本，这些模型也能开始捕捉区分特征，在判别性和校准性方面有显著提升。正负样本之间的区分与图像-文本对齐同等重要。

Conclusion: 监督水平和适应策略共同影响诊断性能和多模态结构，为模型选择、适应策略和标注投资提供了指导。

Abstract: Fine-grained glomerular subtyping is central to kidney biopsy interpretation, but clinically valuable labels are scarce and difficult to obtain. Existing computational pathology approaches instead tend to evaluate coarse diseased classification under full supervision with image-only models, so it remains unclear how vision-language models (VLMs) should be adapted for clinically meaningful subtyping under data constraints. In this work, we model fine-grained glomerular subtyping as a clinically realistic few-shot problem and systematically evaluate both pathology-specialized and general-purpose vision-language models under this setting. We assess not only classification performance (accuracy, AUC, F1) but also the geometry of the learned representations, examining feature alignment between image and text embeddings and the separability of glomerular subtypes. By jointly analyzing shot count, model architecture and domain knowledge, and adaptation strategy, this study provides guidance for future model selection and training under real clinical data constraints. Our results indicate that pathology-specialized vision-language backbones, when paired with the vanilla fine-tuning, are the most effective starting point. Even with only 4-8 labeled examples per glomeruli subtype, these models begin to capture distinctions and show substantial gains in discrimination and calibration, though additional supervision continues to yield incremental improvements. We also find that the discrimination between positive and negative examples is as important as image-text alignment. Overall, our results show that supervision level and adaptation strategy jointly shape both diagnostic performance and multimodal structure, providing guidance for model selection, adaptation strategies, and annotation investment.

Motivation: 现有身份保持个性化生成方法过度强调面部区域，导致输出被面部特写主导，存在视觉叙事性弱和复杂文本提示下语义一致性差的问题，核心限制在于身份特征嵌入削弱了生成模型的语义表达能力。

Method: 设计了身份-语义分离的双线推理管道，提出身份自适应融合策略将ID-语义融合推迟到噪声预测阶段，并引入身份聚合前置模块来聚合ID信息并替换随机初始化。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了对面部特写的过度依赖，促进了电影级角色-场景创作，为相关领域提供了更丰富的个性化生成能力。

Abstract: Identity-Preserving Personalized Generation (IPPG) has advanced film production and artistic creation, yet existing approaches overemphasize facial regions, resulting in outputs dominated by facial close-ups.These methods suffer from weak visual narrativity and poor semantic consistency under complex text prompts, with the core limitation rooted in identity (ID) feature embeddings undermining the semantic expressiveness of generative models. To address these issues, this paper presents an IPPG method that breaks the constraint of facial close-ups, achieving synergistic optimization of identity fidelity and scene semantic creation. Specifically, we design a Dual-Line Inference (DLI) pipeline with identity-semantic separation, resolving the representation conflict between ID and semantics inherent in traditional single-path architectures. Further, we propose an Identity Adaptive Fusion (IdAF) strategy that defers ID-semantic fusion to the noise prediction stage, integrating adaptive attention fusion and noise decision masking to avoid ID embedding interference on semantics without manual masking. Finally, an Identity Aggregation Prepending (IdAP) module is introduced to aggregate ID information and replace random initializations, further enhancing identity preservation. Experimental results validate that our method achieves stable and effective performance in IPPG tasks beyond facial close-ups, enabling efficient generation without manual masking or fine-tuning. As a plug-and-play component, it can be rapidly deployed in existing IPPG frameworks, addressing the over-reliance on facial close-ups, facilitating film-level character-scene creation, and providing richer personalized generation capabilities for related domains.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种动态参数优化方法来解决现有基于变换的攻击方法在参数优化方面的局限性，显著提升了攻击的可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于变换的攻击方法存在三个主要问题：1) 仅考虑低迭代设置，无法反映高迭代下的性能；2) 对不同代理模型、迭代次数和任务使用统一参数；3) 传统网格搜索参数优化复杂度高，计算开销大。

Method: 首先通过实证研究揭示了变换参数强度与可迁移性之间的三种动态模式，提出了同心衰减模型来解释这些模式。基于上升后下降模式，提出了复杂度为O(nlogm)的动态参数优化方法。

Result: 在不同代理模型、迭代次数和任务上的综合实验表明，所提出的动态参数优化方法能够显著提高基于变换攻击的可迁移性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的动态参数优化方法有效解决了现有变换攻击的参数优化问题，显著提升了攻击的可迁移性，同时降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: Despite their wide application, the vulnerabilities of deep neural networks raise societal concerns. Among them, transformation-based attacks have demonstrated notable success in transfer attacks. However, existing attacks suffer from blind spots in parameter optimization, limiting their full potential. Specifically, (1) prior work generally considers low-iteration settings, yet attacks perform quite differently at higher iterations, so characterizing overall performance based only on low-iteration results is misleading. (2) Existing attacks use uniform parameters for different surrogate models, iterations, and tasks, which greatly impairs transferability. (3) Traditional transformation parameter optimization relies on grid search. For n parameters with m steps each, the complexity is O(mn). Large computational overhead limits further optimization of parameters. To address these limitations, we conduct an empirical study with various transformations as baselines, revealing three dynamic patterns of transferability with respect to parameter strength. We further propose a novel Concentric Decay Model (CDM) to effectively explain these patterns. Building on these insights, we propose an efficient Dynamic Parameter Optimization (DPO) based on the rise-then-fall pattern, reducing the complexity to O(nlogm). Comprehensive experiments on existing transformation-based attacks across different surrogate models, iterations, and tasks demonstrate that our DPO can significantly improve transferability.

Conclusion: LithoSeg通过创新的粗到细架构和人机交互方法，有效解决了光刻SEM图像分割的精度和鲁棒性问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation and measurement of lithography scanning electron microscope (SEM) images are crucial for ensuring precise process control, optimizing device performance, and advancing semiconductor manufacturing yield. Lithography segmentation requires pixel-level delineation of groove contours and consistent performance across diverse pattern geometries and process window. However, existing methods often lack the necessary precision and robustness, limiting their practical applicability. To overcome this challenge, we propose LithoSeg, a coarse-to-fine network tailored for lithography segmentation. In the coarse stage, we introduce a Human-in-the-Loop Bootstrapping scheme for the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to attain robustness with minimal supervision. In the subsequent fine stage, we recast 2D segmentation as 1D regression problem by sampling groove-normal profiles using the coarse mask and performing point-wise refinement with a lightweight MLP. LithoSeg outperforms previous approaches in both segmentation accuracy and metrology precision while requiring less supervision, offering promising prospects for real-world applications.

Conclusion: 为显微镜中的无标签适应提供了设计原则，并为现场应用提供了解决方案，代码已公开。

Abstract: Deep learning is transforming microscopy, yet models often fail when applied to images from new instruments or acquisition settings. Conventional adversarial domain adaptation (ADDA) retrains entire networks, often disrupting learned semantic representations. Here, we overturn this paradigm by showing that adapting only the earliest convolutional layers, while freezing deeper layers, yields reliable transfer. Building on this principle, we introduce Subnetwork Image Translation ADDA with automatic depth selection (SIT-ADDA-Auto), a self-configuring framework that integrates shallow-layer adversarial alignment with predictive uncertainty to automatically select adaptation depth without target labels. We demonstrate robustness via multi-metric evaluation, blinded expert assessment, and uncertainty-depth ablations. Across exposure and illumination shifts, cross-instrument transfer, and multiple stains, SIT-ADDA improves reconstruction and downstream segmentation over full-encoder adaptation and non-adversarial baselines, with reduced drift of semantic features. Our results provide a design rule for label-free adaptation in microscopy and a recipe for field settings; the code is publicly available.

Abstract: Traffic safety analysis at signalized intersections is vital for reducing vehicle and pedestrian collisions, yet traditional crash-based studies are limited by data sparsity and latency. This paper presents a novel multi-camera computer vision framework for real-time safety assessment through Post-Encroachment Time (PET) computation, demonstrated at the intersection of H Street and Broadway in Chula Vista, California. Four synchronized cameras provide continuous visual coverage, with each frame processed on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier devices using YOLOv11 segmentation for vehicle detection. Detected vehicle polygons are transformed into a unified bird's-eye map using homography matrices, enabling alignment across overlapping camera views. A novel pixel-level PET algorithm measures vehicle position without reliance on fixed cells, allowing fine-grained hazard visualization via dynamic heatmaps, accurate to 3.3 sq-cm. Timestamped vehicle and PET data is stored in an SQL database for long-term monitoring. Results over various time intervals demonstrate the framework's ability to identify high-risk regions with sub-second precision and real-time throughput on edge devices, producing data for an 800 x 800 pixel logarithmic heatmap at an average of 2.68 FPS. This study validates the feasibility of decentralized vision-based PET analysis for intelligent transportation systems, offering a replicable methodology for high-resolution, real-time, and scalable intersection safety evaluation.

Conclusion: LIHE框架成功解决了弱监督广义指代表达理解的关键挑战，为处理可变数量目标的表达式提供了有效解决方案，混合相似度方法在防止语义崩溃方面表现出色。

Abstract: Existing Weakly-Supervised Referring Expression Comprehension (WREC) methods, while effective, are fundamentally limited by a one-to-one mapping assumption, hindering their ability to handle expressions corresponding to zero or multiple targets in realistic scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Weakly-Supervised Generalized Referring Expression Comprehension task (WGREC), a more practical paradigm that handles expressions with variable numbers of referents. However, extending WREC to WGREC presents two fundamental challenges: supervisory signal ambiguity, where weak image-level supervision is insufficient for training a model to infer the correct number and identity of referents, and semantic representation collapse, where standard Euclidean similarity forces hierarchically-related concepts into non-discriminative clusters, blurring categorical boundaries. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel WGREC framework named Linguistic Instance-Split Hyperbolic-Euclidean (LIHE), which operates in two stages. The first stage, Referential Decoupling, predicts the number of target objects and decomposes the complex expression into simpler sub-expressions. The second stage, Referent Grounding, then localizes these sub-expressions using HEMix, our innovative hybrid similarity module that synergistically combines the precise alignment capabilities of Euclidean proximity with the hierarchical modeling strengths of hyperbolic geometry. This hybrid approach effectively prevents semantic collapse while preserving fine-grained distinctions between related concepts. Extensive experiments demonstrate LIHE establishes the first effective weakly supervised WGREC baseline on gRefCOCO and Ref-ZOM, while HEMix achieves consistent improvements on standard REC benchmarks, improving IoU@0.5 by up to 2.5\%.

TL;DR: 提出了Null-Space Diffusion Distillation (NSDD)方法，通过单次前向传播蒸馏迭代DDNM+求解器的零空间组件，在无需配对监督的情况下实现快速、逼真的无透镜成像重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无透镜相机重建方法依赖配对的无透镜-有透镜监督，存在领域不匹配偏差；而通用的扩散先验方法在无透镜反卷积的噪声、高度复用和病态设置下容易失效。

Method: NSDD方法将范围空间强制与零空间扩散先验更新分离，通过单次学生网络蒸馏迭代DDNM+求解器的零空间组件，以无透镜测量和范围空间锚点为条件。

Result: 在Lensless-FFHQ和PhlatCam数据集上，NSDD是第二快的方法（仅次于Wiener），接近教师模型的感知质量（第二好的LPIPS，低于DDNM+），优于DPS和经典凸优化基线方法。

Conclusion: NSDD为快速、无需真实值、逼真的无透镜成像提供了一条实用路径，在保持测量一致性的同时以极低的运行时间和内存成本实现逼真重建。

Abstract: State-of-the-art photorealistic reconstructions for lensless cameras often rely on paired lensless-lensed supervision, which can bias models due to lens-lensless domain mismatch. To avoid this, ground-truth-free diffusion priors are attractive; however, generic formulations tuned for conventional inverse problems often break under the noisy, highly multiplexed, and ill-posed lensless deconvolution setting. We observe that methods which separate range-space enforcement from null-space diffusion-prior updates yield stable, realistic reconstructions. Building on this, we introduce Null-Space Diffusion Distillation (NSDD): a single-pass student that distills the null-space component of an iterative DDNM+ solver, conditioned on the lensless measurement and on a range-space anchor. NSDD preserves measurement consistency and achieves photorealistic results without paired supervision at a fraction of the runtime and memory. On Lensless-FFHQ and PhlatCam, NSDD is the second fastest, behind Wiener, and achieves near-teacher perceptual quality (second-best LPIPS, below DDNM+), outperforming DPS and classical convex baselines. These results suggest a practical path toward fast, ground-truth-free, photorealistic lensless imaging.

Conclusion: 通过桥接视觉和语言模态，VL-SurgPT能够开发上下文感知的追踪系统，这对于推进计算机辅助手术应用至关重要，即使在具有挑战性的术中条件下也能保持性能。

Abstract: Accurate point tracking in surgical environments remains challenging due to complex visual conditions, including smoke occlusion, specular reflections, and tissue deformation. While existing surgical tracking datasets provide coordinate information, they lack the semantic context necessary to understand tracking failure mechanisms. We introduce VL-SurgPT, the first large-scale multimodal dataset that bridges visual tracking with textual descriptions of point status in surgical scenes. The dataset comprises 908 in vivo video clips, including 754 for tissue tracking (17,171 annotated points across five challenging scenarios) and 154 for instrument tracking (covering seven instrument types with detailed keypoint annotations). We establish comprehensive benchmarks using eight state-of-the-art tracking methods and propose TG-SurgPT, a text-guided tracking approach that leverages semantic descriptions to improve robustness in visually challenging conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating point status information significantly improves tracking accuracy and reliability, particularly in adverse visual scenarios where conventional vision-only methods struggle. By bridging visual and linguistic modalities, VL-SurgPT enables the development of context-aware tracking systems crucial for advancing computer-assisted surgery applications that can maintain performance even under challenging intraoperative conditions.

Abstract: Long-video understanding remains a significant challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) due to inherent token limitations and the complexity of capturing long-term temporal dependencies. Existing methods often fail to capture the global context and complex event relationships necessary for deep video reasoning. To address this, we introduce GCAgent, a novel Global-Context-Aware Agent framework that achieves comprehensive long-video understanding. Our core innovation is the Schematic and Narrative Episodic Memory. This memory structurally models events and their causal and temporal relations into a concise, organized context, fundamentally resolving the long-term dependency problem. Operating in a multi-stage Perception-Action-Reflection cycle, our GCAgent utilizes a Memory Manager to retrieve relevant episodic context for robust, context-aware inference. Extensive experiments confirm that GCAgent significantly enhances long-video understanding, achieving up to 23.5\% accuracy improvement on the Video-MME Long split over a strong MLLM baseline. Furthermore, our framework establishes state-of-the-art performance among comparable 7B-scale MLLMs, achieving 73.4\% accuracy on the Long split and the highest overall average (71.9\%) on the Video-MME benchmark, validating our agent-based reasoning paradigm and structured memory for cognitively-inspired long-video understanding.

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合视觉和物理线索的手-物体3D姿态估计框架，通过视觉-物理线索联合学习和候选姿态聚合，实现视觉一致且物理合理的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖视觉线索，常产生违反物理约束的结果；而引入物理推理的方法通常依赖后优化或不可微物理引擎，影响视觉一致性和端到端训练。

Method: 1) 视觉-物理线索联合学习：提取2D视觉线索和3D物理线索；2) 候选姿态聚合：通过扩散生成多个候选姿态，利用视觉和物理预测进行聚合。

Result: 在姿态精度和物理合理性方面显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架成功整合了视觉和物理线索，实现了更准确且物理合理的手-物体姿态估计。

Abstract: Estimating the 3D poses of hands and objects from a single RGB image is a fundamental yet challenging problem, with broad applications in augmented reality and human-computer interaction. Existing methods largely rely on visual cues alone, often producing results that violate physical constraints such as interpenetration or non-contact. Recent efforts to incorporate physics reasoning typically depend on post-optimization or non-differentiable physics engines, which compromise visual consistency and end-to-end trainability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework that jointly integrates visual and physical cues for hand-object pose estimation. This integration is achieved through two key ideas: 1) joint visual-physical cue learning: The model is trained to extract 2D visual cues and 3D physical cues, thereby enabling more comprehensive representation learning for hand-object interactions; 2) candidate pose aggregation: A novel refinement process that aggregates multiple diffusion-generated candidate poses by leveraging both visual and physical predictions, yielding a final estimate that is visually consistent and physically plausible. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in both pose accuracy and physical plausibility.

Motivation: 现有掩码图像生成方法仅依赖模型自身学习视觉token序列的语义依赖关系，但由于单个token缺乏明确语义且序列较长，直接学习这些依赖关系具有挑战性。

Method: 提出KA-MIG框架，引入三种先验知识图（共现图、语义相似图、位置-token不兼容图），设计图感知编码器学习token和位置感知表示，并通过轻量融合机制集成到现有MIG方法中。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在ImageNet上的类条件图像生成任务中优于现有MIG方法。

Conclusion: 通过引入先验知识，KA-MIG有效增强了模型捕捉语义依赖关系的能力，从而提高了生成质量。

Abstract: Masked image generation (MIG) has demonstrated remarkable efficiency and high-fidelity images by enabling parallel token prediction. Existing methods typically rely solely on the model itself to learn semantic dependencies among visual token sequences. However, directly learning such semantic dependencies from data is challenging because the individual tokens lack clear semantic meanings, and these sequences are usually long. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Knowledge-Augmented Masked Image Generation framework, named KA-MIG, which introduces explicit knowledge of token-level semantic dependencies (\emph{i.e.}, extracted from the training data) as priors to learn richer representations for improving performance. In particular, we explore and identify three types of advantageous token knowledge graphs, including two positive and one negative graphs (\emph{i.e.}, the co-occurrence graph, the semantic similarity graph, and the position-token incompatibility graph). Based on three prior knowledge graphs, we design a graph-aware encoder to learn token and position-aware representations. After that, a lightweight fusion mechanism is introduced to integrate these enriched representations into the existing MIG methods. Resorting to such prior knowledge, our method effectively enhances the model's ability to capture semantic dependencies, leading to improved generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves upon existing MIG for class-conditional image generation on ImageNet.

Conclusion: CalMRL有效解决了缺失模态带来的对齐问题，扩展了多模态表示学习的应用范围，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning harmonizes distinct modalities by aligning them into a unified latent space. Recent research generalizes traditional cross-modal alignment to produce enhanced multimodal synergy but requires all modalities to be present for a common instance, making it challenging to utilize prevalent datasets with missing modalities. We provide theoretical insights into this issue from an anchor shift perspective. Observed modalities are aligned with a local anchor that deviates from the optimal one when all modalities are present, resulting in an inevitable shift. To address this, we propose CalMRL for multimodal representation learning to calibrate incomplete alignments caused by missing modalities. Specifically, CalMRL leverages the priors and the inherent connections among modalities to model the imputation for the missing ones at the representation level. To resolve the optimization dilemma, we employ a bi-step learning method with the closed-form solution of the posterior distribution of shared latents. We validate its mitigation of anchor shift and convergence with theoretical guidance. By equipping the calibrated alignment with the existing advanced method, we offer new flexibility to absorb data with missing modalities, which is originally unattainable. Extensive experiments and comprehensive analyses demonstrate the superiority of CalMRL. Our code, model checkpoints, and evaluation raw data will be publicly available.

Conclusion: SRSplat通过有效利用外部参考信息和内部纹理线索，成功解决了从稀疏低分辨率图像重建高质量3D场景的挑战。

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D reconstruction from sparse, low-resolution (LR) images is a crucial capability for real-world applications, such as autonomous driving and embodied AI. However, existing methods often fail to recover fine texture details. This limitation stems from the inherent lack of high-frequency information in LR inputs. To address this, we propose \textbf{SRSplat}, a feed-forward framework that reconstructs high-resolution 3D scenes from only a few LR views. Our main insight is to compensate for the deficiency of texture information by jointly leveraging external high-quality reference images and internal texture cues. We first construct a scene-specific reference gallery, generated for each scene using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and diffusion models. To integrate this external information, we introduce the \textit{Reference-Guided Feature Enhancement (RGFE)} module, which aligns and fuses features from the LR input images and their reference twin image. Subsequently, we train a decoder to predict the Gaussian primitives using the multi-view fused feature obtained from \textit{RGFE}. To further refine predicted Gaussian primitives, we introduce \textit{Texture-Aware Density Control (TADC)}, which adaptively adjusts Gaussian density based on the internal texture richness of the LR inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SRSplat outperforms existing methods on various datasets, including RealEstate10K, ACID, and DTU, and exhibits strong cross-dataset and cross-resolution generalization capabilities.

Motivation: 联邦学习在非IID数据上面临挑战，特别是组织病理学图像存在特征分布偏移问题。现有方法对此关注有限，需要从数据分布角度解决非IID问题。

Method: 基于扩散模型拟合数据分布，利用染色分离提取关键特征，提出FedSDA方法在联邦学习框架中对齐各客户端的染色分布与目标分布。避免在原始数据上训练扩散模型以降低隐私泄露风险。

Conclusion: FedSDA为计算病理学社区提供了有价值的实践见解，能有效缓解联邦学习中非IID组织病理学图像的分布偏移问题。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has shown success in collaboratively training a model among decentralized data resources without directly sharing privacy-sensitive training data. Despite recent advances, non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data poses an inevitable challenge that hinders the use of FL. In this work, we address the issue of non-IID histopathological images with feature distribution shifts from an intuitive perspective that has only received limited attention. Specifically, we address this issue from the perspective of data distribution by solely adjusting the data distributions of all clients. Building on the success of diffusion models in fitting data distributions and leveraging stain separation to extract the pivotal features that are closely related to the non-IID properties of histopathological images, we propose a Federated Stain Distribution Alignment (FedSDA) method. FedSDA aligns the stain distribution of each client with a target distribution in an FL framework to mitigate distribution shifts among clients. Furthermore, considering that training diffusion models on raw data in FL has been shown to be susceptible to privacy leakage risks, we circumvent this problem while still effectively achieving alignment. Extensive experimental results show that FedSDA is not only effective in improving baselines that focus on mitigating disparities across clients' model updates but also outperforms baselines that address the non-IID data issues from the perspective of data distribution. We show that FedSDA provides valuable and practical insights for the computational pathology community.

Motivation: 医学图像中存在潜在的解剖学分组（如器官、组织和病理区域），但标准的ViT无法有效利用这些结构。现有方法如SBM-Transformer存在不可微分性、训练不稳定和无法建模复杂社区结构的问题。

Method: 提出DCMM-Transformer，将度校正混合成员模型作为自注意力中的加性偏置引入，以完全可微分和可解释的方式建模社区结构和度异质性，避免了乘性掩码和二元采样。

Conclusion: 所学习的群组结构和结构化注意力调制显著增强了可解释性，产生了解剖学上有意义且语义连贯的注意力图。

Abstract: Medical images exhibit latent anatomical groupings, such as organs, tissues, and pathological regions, that standard Vision Transformers (ViTs) fail to exploit. While recent work like SBM-Transformer attempts to incorporate such structures through stochastic binary masking, they suffer from non-differentiability, training instability, and the inability to model complex community structure. We present DCMM-Transformer, a novel ViT architecture for medical image analysis that incorporates a Degree-Corrected Mixed-Membership (DCMM) model as an additive bias in self-attention. Unlike prior approaches that rely on multiplicative masking and binary sampling, our method introduces community structure and degree heterogeneity in a fully differentiable and interpretable manner. Comprehensive experiments across diverse medical imaging datasets, including brain, chest, breast, and ocular modalities, demonstrate the superior performance and generalizability of the proposed approach. Furthermore, the learned group structure and structured attention modulation substantially enhance interpretability by yielding attention maps that are anatomically meaningful and semantically coherent.

Trained on the OpenForensics dataset (190,335 images), DeiTFake achieves 98.71\% accuracy after stage one and 99.22\% accuracy with an AUROC of 0.9997, after stage two, outperforming the latest OpenForensics baselines. We analyze augmentation impact and training schedules, and provide practical benchmarks for facial deepfake detection.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) matches query images ($\textit{e.g.}$, drone) to geographically corresponding opposite-view imagery ($\textit{e.g.}$, satellite). While supervised methods achieve strong performance, their reliance on extensive pairwise annotations limits scalability. Unsupervised alternatives avoid annotation costs but suffer from noisy pseudo-labels due to intrinsic cross-view domain gaps. To address these limitations, we propose $\textit{UniABG}$, a novel dual-stage unsupervised cross-view geo-localization framework integrating adversarial view bridging with graph-based correspondence calibration. Our approach first employs View-Aware Adversarial Bridging (VAAB) to model view-invariant features and enhance pseudo-label robustness. Subsequently, Heterogeneous Graph Filtering Calibration (HGFC) refines cross-view associations by constructing dual inter-view structure graphs, achieving reliable view correspondence. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art unsupervised performance, showing that UniABG improves Satellite $\rightarrow$ Drone AP by +10.63\% on University-1652 and +16.73\% on SUES-200, even surpassing supervised baselines.

Abstract: Video generation has been advancing rapidly, and diffusion transformer (DiT) based models have demonstrated remark- able capabilities. However, their practical deployment is of- ten hindered by slow inference speeds and high memory con- sumption. In this paper, we propose a novel pipelining frame- work named PipeDiT to accelerate video generation, which is equipped with three main innovations. First, we design a pipelining algorithm (PipeSP) for sequence parallelism (SP) to enable the computation of latent generation and commu- nication among multiple GPUs to be pipelined, thus reduc- ing inference latency. Second, we propose DeDiVAE to de- couple the diffusion module and the variational autoencoder (VAE) module into two GPU groups, whose executions can also be pipelined to reduce memory consumption and infer- ence latency. Third, to better utilize the GPU resources in the VAE group, we propose an attention co-processing (Aco) method to further reduce the overall video generation latency. We integrate our PipeDiT into both OpenSoraPlan and Hun- yuanVideo, two state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks, and conduct extensive experiments on two 8- GPU systems. Experimental results show that, under many common resolution and timestep configurations, our PipeDiT achieves 1.06x to 4.02x speedups over OpenSoraPlan and HunyuanVideo.

TL;DR: MovSemCL是一个基于运动语义对比学习的轨迹相似度计算框架，通过运动语义特征转换、分层注意力编码和曲率引导增强策略，解决了现有方法在语义建模、计算效率和物理合理性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的轨迹相似度计算方法存在三个主要问题：(1) 对轨迹语义和层次结构建模不足，缺乏运动动态提取和多尺度结构表示；(2) 逐点编码导致高计算成本；(3) 使用物理上不合理的增强方法扭曲轨迹语义。

Conclusion: MovSemCL能够有效解决现有轨迹相似度计算方法的关键局限性，在性能、效率和物理合理性方面均优于最先进方法。

Abstract: Trajectory similarity computation is fundamental functionality that is used for, e.g., clustering, prediction, and anomaly detection. However, existing learning-based methods exhibit three key limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of trajectory semantics and hierarchy, lacking both movement dynamics extraction and multi-scale structural representation; (2) high computational costs due to point-wise encoding; and (3) use of physically implausible augmentations that distort trajectory semantics. To address these issues, we propose MovSemCL, a movement-semantics contrastive learning framework for trajectory similarity computation. MovSemCL first transforms raw GPS trajectories into movement-semantics features and then segments them into patches. Next, MovSemCL employs intra- and inter-patch attentions to encode local as well as global trajectory patterns, enabling efficient hierarchical representation and reducing computational costs. Moreover, MovSemCL includes a curvature-guided augmentation strategy that preserves informative segments (e.g., turns and intersections) and masks redundant ones, generating physically plausible augmented views. Experiments on real-world datasets show that MovSemCL is capable of outperforming state-of-the-art methods, achieving mean ranks close to the ideal value of 1 at similarity search tasks and improvements by up to 20.3% at heuristic approximation, while reducing inference latency by up to 43.4%.

Abstract: Purple fringing, a persistent artifact caused by Longitudinal Chromatic Aberration (LCA) in camera lenses, has long degraded the clarity and realism of digital imaging. Traditional solutions rely on complex and expensive apochromatic (APO) lens hardware and the extraction of handcrafted features, ignoring the data-driven approach. To fill this gap, we introduce DCA-LUT, the first deep learning framework for purple fringing removal. Inspired by the physical root of the problem, the spatial misalignment of RGB color channels due to lens dispersion, we introduce a novel Chromatic-Aware Coordinate Transformation (CA-CT) module, learning an image-adaptive color space to decouple and isolate fringing into a dedicated dimension. This targeted separation allows the network to learn a precise ``purple fringe channel", which then guides the accurate restoration of the luminance channel. The final color correction is performed by a learned 5D Look-Up Table (5D LUT), enabling efficient and powerful% non-linear color mapping. To enable robust training and fair evaluation, we constructed a large-scale synthetic purple fringing dataset (PF-Synth). Extensive experiments in synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in purple fringing removal.

Abstract: Emotion understanding is critical for making Large Language Models (LLMs) more general, reliable, and aligned with humans. Art conveys emotion through the joint design of visual and auditory elements, yet most prior work is human-centered or single-modality, overlooking the emotion intentionally expressed by the artwork. Meanwhile, current Audio-Visual Language Models (AVLMs) typically require large-scale audio pretraining to endow Visual Language Models (VLMs) with hearing, which limits scalability. We present Vision Anchored Audio-Visual Emotion LLM (VAEmotionLLM), a two-stage framework that teaches a VLM to hear by seeing with limited audio pretraining and to understand emotion across modalities. In Stage 1, Vision-Guided Audio Alignment (VG-Align) distills the frozen visual pathway into a new audio pathway by aligning next-token distributions of the shared LLM on synchronized audio-video clips, enabling hearing without a large audio dataset. In Stage 2, a lightweight Cross-Modal Emotion Adapter (EmoAdapter), composed of the Emotion Enhancer and the Emotion Supervisor, injects emotion-sensitive residuals and applies emotion supervision to enhance cross-modal emotion understanding. We also construct ArtEmoBenchmark, an art-centric emotion benchmark that evaluates content and emotion understanding under audio-only, visual-only, and audio-visual inputs. VAEmotionLLM achieves state-of-the-art results on ArtEmoBenchmark, outperforming audio-only, visual-only, and audio-visual baselines. Ablations show that the proposed components are complementary.

Abstract: Vector quantization has emerged as a powerful tool in large-scale multimodal models, unifying heterogeneous representations through discrete token encoding. However, its effectiveness hinges on robust codebook design. Current prototype-based approaches relying on trainable vectors or clustered centroids fall short in representativeness and interpretability, even as multimodal alignment demonstrates its promise in vision-language models. To address these limitations, we propose a simple multimodal prompting-driven quantization framework for point cloud analysis. Our methodology is built upon two core insights: 1) Text embeddings from pre-trained models inherently encode visual semantics through many-to-one contrastive alignment, naturally serving as robust prototype priors; and 2) Multimodal prompts enable adaptive refinement of these prototypes, effectively mitigating vision-language semantic gaps. The framework introduces a dual-constrained quantization space, enforced by compactness and separation regularization, which seamlessly integrates visual and prototype features, resulting in hybrid representations that jointly encode geometric and semantic information. Furthermore, we employ Gumbel-Softmax relaxation to achieve differentiable discretization while maintaining quantization sparsity. Extensive experiments on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets clearly demonstrate the superior effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: 所提出的分层分组提示调优方法通过增强模型稳定性，在持续学习中有效缓解了灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Prompt-based continual learning methods fine-tune only a small set of additional learnable parameters while keeping the pre-trained model's parameters frozen. It enables efficient adaptation to new tasks while mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting. These methods typically attach one independent task-specific prompt to each layer of pre-trained models to locally modulate its features, ensuring that the layer's representation aligns with the requirements of the new task. However, although introducing learnable prompts independently at each layer provides high flexibility for adapting to new tasks, this overly flexible tuning could make certain layers susceptible to unnecessary updates. As all prompts till the current task are added together as a final prompt for all seen tasks, the model may easily overwrite feature representations essential to previous tasks, which increases the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue, we propose a novel hierarchical layer-grouped prompt tuning method for continual learning. It improves model stability in two ways: (i) Layers in the same group share roughly the same prompts, which are adjusted by position encoding. This helps preserve the intrinsic feature relationships and propagation pathways of the pre-trained model within each group. (ii) It utilizes a single task-specific root prompt to learn to generate sub-prompts for each layer group. In this way, all sub-prompts are conditioned on the same root prompt, enhancing their synergy and reducing independence. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves favorable performance compared with several state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: PACE是首个面向SNN和事件视觉的数据集蒸馏框架，通过ST-DSM和PEQ-N模块将大型训练数据集压缩成紧凑的合成数据集，显著降低SNN训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNN因时间编码导致训练成本高昂，限制了实际部署。事件相机与SNN的生物启发特性使其成为有前景的能效替代方案，但训练成本问题亟待解决。

Method: 提出PACE框架，包含两个核心模块：ST-DSM使用残差膜电位来稠化基于脉冲的特征，并进行精细的时空幅度和相位匹配；PEQ-N提供即插即用的直通概率整数量化器。

Result: 在DVS-Gesture、CIFAR10-DVS和N-MNIST数据集上，PACE优于现有核心集选择和数据集蒸馏基线，特别是在动态事件流和低/中等IPC情况下表现突出。在N-MNIST上达到84.4%准确率，约为完整训练集性能的85%，同时减少训练时间50倍以上，存储成本6000倍。

Conclusion: PACE能够生成紧凑的替代数据集，实现分钟级SNN训练和高效边缘部署，为事件视觉和SNN的实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Event cameras sense brightness changes and output binary asynchronous event streams, attracting increasing attention. Their bio-inspired dynamics align well with spiking neural networks (SNNs), offering a promising energy-efficient alternative to conventional vision systems. However, SNNs remain costly to train due to temporal coding, which limits their practical deployment. To alleviate the high training cost of SNNs, we introduce \textbf{PACE} (Phase-Aligned Condensation for Events), the first dataset distillation framework to SNNs and event-based vision. PACE distills a large training dataset into a compact synthetic one that enables fast SNN training, which is achieved by two core modules: \textbf{ST-DSM} and \textbf{PEQ-N}. ST-DSM uses residual membrane potentials to densify spike-based features (SDR) and to perform fine-grained spatiotemporal matching of amplitude and phase (ST-SM), while PEQ-N provides a plug-and-play straight through probabilistic integer quantizer compatible with standard event-frame pipelines. Across DVS-Gesture, CIFAR10-DVS, and N-MNIST datasets, PACE outperforms existing coreset selection and dataset distillation baselines, with particularly strong gains on dynamic event streams and at low or moderate IPC. Specifically, on N-MNIST, it achieves \(84.4\%\) accuracy, about \(85\%\) of the full training set performance, while reducing training time by more than \(50\times\) and storage cost by \(6000\times\), yielding compact surrogates that enable minute-scale SNN training and efficient edge deployment.

Abstract: Brain-inspired Spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient intelligence via event-driven, sparse computation, but deeper architectures inflate parameters and computational cost, hindering their edge deployment. Recent progress in SNN pruning helps alleviate this burden, yet existing efforts fall into only two families: \emph{unstructured} pruning, which attains high sparsity but is difficult to accelerate on general hardware, and \emph{structured} pruning, which eases deployment but lack flexibility and often degrades accuracy at matched sparsity. In this work, we introduce \textbf{SpikeNM}, the first SNN-oriented \emph{semi-structured} \(N{:}M\) pruning framework that learns sparse SNNs \emph{from scratch}, enforcing \emph{at most \(N\)} non-zeros per \(M\)-weight block. To avoid the combinatorial space complexity \(\sum_{k=1}^{N}\binom{M}{k}\) growing exponentially with \(M\), SpikeNM adopts an \(M\)-way basis-logit parameterization with a differentiable top-\(k\) sampler, \emph{linearizing} per-block complexity to \(\mathcal O(M)\) and enabling more aggressive sparsification. Further inspired by neuroscience, we propose \emph{eligibility-inspired distillation} (EID), which converts temporally accumulated credits into block-wise soft targets to align mask probabilities with spiking dynamics, reducing sampling variance and stabilizing search under high sparsity. Experiments show that at \(2{:}4\) sparsity, SpikeNM maintains and even with gains across main-stream datasets, while yielding hardware-amenable patterns that complement intrinsic spike sparsity.

Conclusion: 这是首个利用DINOv3表示进行医学图像翻译的工作，展示了自监督Transformer引导在语义感知CT合成中的潜力。

Abstract: Generating synthetic CT images from CBCT or MRI has a potential for efficient radiation dose planning and adaptive radiotherapy. However, existing CNN-based models lack global semantic understanding, while Transformers often overfit small medical datasets due to high model capacity and weak inductive bias. To address these limitations, we propose a DINOv3-Guided Cross Fusion (DGCF) framework that integrates a frozen self-supervised DINOv3 Transformer with a trainable CNN encoder-decoder. It hierarchically fuses global representation of Transformer and local features of CNN via a learnable cross fusion module, achieving balanced local appearance and contextual representation. Furthermore, we introduce a Multi-Level DINOv3 Perceptual (MLDP) loss that encourages semantic similarity between synthetic CT and the ground truth in DINOv3's feature space. Experiments on the SynthRAD2023 pelvic dataset demonstrate that DGCF achieved state-of-the-art performance in terms of MS-SSIM, PSNR and segmentation-based metrics on both MRI$\rightarrow$CT and CBCT$\rightarrow$CT translation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to employ DINOv3 representations for medical image translation, highlighting the potential of self-supervised Transformer guidance for semantic-aware CT synthesis.

Conclusion: 提出的ada-BOV方法能够有效提升自回归视频扩散模型的生成质量，在保持全局一致性的同时改善局部动态表现。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion-based video generation have produced impressive and high-fidelity short videos. To extend these successes to generate coherent long videos, most video diffusion models (VDMs) generate videos in an autoregressive manner, i.e., generating subsequent frames conditioned on previous ones. There are generally two primary paradigms: chunk-based extension and stream denoising. The former directly concatenates previous clean frames as conditioning, suffering from denoising latency and error accumulation. The latter maintains the denoising sequence with monotonically increasing noise levels. In each denoising iteration, one clean frame is produced while a new pure noise is simultaneously appended, enabling live-stream sampling. However, it struggles with fragile consistency and poor motion dynamics. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Begin-of-Video Tokens (ada-BOV) for autoregressive VDMs. The BOV tokens are special learnable embeddings on VDMs. They adaptively absorb denoised preceding frames via an adaptive-layer-norm-like modulation. This design preserves the global consistency while allowing for flexible conditioning in dynamic scenarios. To ensure the quality of local dynamics essential in modulating BOV tokens, we further propose a refinement strategy for stream denoising. It decouples the sampling trajectory length from the attention window size constraint, leading to improved local guidance and overall imaging quality. We also propose a disturbance-augmented training noise schedule, which balances the convergence speed with model robustness for the stream denoising. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves compelling qualitative and quantitative results across multiple metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉模型仅依赖有限充分原因进行预测，对分布偏移或关键特征缺失敏感。模型的关键区域被遮蔽后会导致误分类，而人类仍能识别，表明模型学习依赖关系不够因果充分

Method: 基于LIMA归因方法开发Counterfactual LIMA识别最小空间区域集，移除这些区域可选择性改变模型预测。提出数据增强策略，将识别区域替换为自然背景，在原始样本和增强样本上联合训练

Result: 在多个ImageNet变体上的实验表明，SS-CA提高了分布内测试数据的泛化能力，在ImageNet-R和ImageNet-S等分布外基准上表现更优。在噪声等扰动下，SS-CA训练的模型也展现出增强的泛化能力

Conclusion: SS-CA有效利用可解释性洞察纠正模型缺陷，提升性能和鲁棒性，证明该方法能改善模型的不完整因果学习

Abstract: In current visual model training, models often rely on only limited sufficient causes for their predictions, which makes them sensitive to distribution shifts or the absence of key features. Attribution methods can accurately identify a model's critical regions. However, masking these areas to create counterfactuals often causes the model to misclassify the target, while humans can still easily recognize it. This divergence highlights that the model's learned dependencies may not be sufficiently causal. To address this issue, we propose Subset-Selected Counterfactual Augmentation (SS-CA), which integrates counterfactual explanations directly into the training process for targeted intervention. Building on the subset-selection-based LIMA attribution method, we develop Counterfactual LIMA to identify minimal spatial region sets whose removal can selectively alter model predictions. Leveraging these attributions, we introduce a data augmentation strategy that replaces the identified regions with natural background, and we train the model jointly on both augmented and original samples to mitigate incomplete causal learning. Extensive experiments across multiple ImageNet variants show that SS-CA improves generalization on in-distribution (ID) test data and achieves superior performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks such as ImageNet-R and ImageNet-S. Under perturbations including noise, models trained with SS-CA also exhibit enhanced generalization, demonstrating that our approach effectively uses interpretability insights to correct model deficiencies and improve both performance and robustness.

Abstract: The proliferation of sophisticated deepfakes poses significant threats to information integrity. While DINOv2 shows promise for detection, existing fine-tuning approaches treat it as generic binary classification, overlooking distinct artifacts inherent to different deepfake methods. To address this, we propose a DeepFake Fine-Grained Adapter (DFF-Adapter) for DINOv2. Our method incorporates lightweight multi-head LoRA modules into every transformer block, enabling efficient backbone adaptation. DFF-Adapter simultaneously addresses authenticity detection and fine-grained manipulation type classification, where classifying forgery methods enhances artifact sensitivity. We introduce a shared branch propagating fine-grained manipulation cues to the authenticity head. This enables multi-task cooperative optimization, explicitly enhancing authenticity discrimination with manipulation-specific knowledge. Utilizing only 3.5M trainable parameters, our parameter-efficient approach achieves detection accuracy comparable to or even surpassing that of current complex state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Despite the progress in medical image segmentation, most existing methods remain task-specific and lack interactivity. Although recent text-prompt-based segmentation approaches enhance user-driven and reasoning-based segmentation, they remain confined to single-round dialogues and fail to perform multi-round reasoning. In this work, we introduce Multi-Round Entity-Level Medical Reasoning Segmentation (MEMR-Seg), a new task that requires generating segmentation masks through multi-round queries with entity-level reasoning. To support this task, we construct MR-MedSeg, a large-scale dataset of 177K multi-round medical segmentation dialogues, featuring entity-based reasoning across rounds. Furthermore, we propose MediRound, an effective baseline model designed for multi-round medical reasoning segmentation. To mitigate the inherent error propagation in the chain-like pipeline of multi-round segmentation, we introduce a lightweight yet effective Judgment & Correction Mechanism during model inference. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively addresses the MEMR-Seg task and outperforms conventional medical referring segmentation methods.

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene motion perception significantly enhances the safety and reliability of an autonomous driving system. Benefiting from its all-weather operational capability and unique perceptual properties, 4D mmWave radar has emerged as an essential component in advanced autonomous driving. However, sparse and noisy radar points often lead to imprecise motion perception, leaving autonomous vehicles with limited sensing capabilities when optical sensors degrade under adverse weather conditions. In this paper, we propose RadarMP, a novel method for precise 3D scene motion perception using low-level radar echo signals from two consecutive frames. Unlike existing methods that separate radar target detection and motion estimation, RadarMP jointly models both tasks in a unified architecture, enabling consistent radar point cloud generation and pointwise 3D scene flow prediction. Tailored to radar characteristics, we design specialized self-supervised loss functions guided by Doppler shifts and echo intensity, effectively supervising spatial and motion consistency without explicit annotations. Extensive experiments on the public dataset demonstrate that RadarMP achieves reliable motion perception across diverse weather and illumination conditions, outperforming radar-based decoupled motion perception pipelines and enhancing perception capabilities for full-scenario autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a crucial tool in Visual Question Answering (VQA) for handling knowledge-intensive questions in few-shot or zero-shot scenarios. However, their reliance on massive training datasets often causes them to inherit language biases during the acquisition of knowledge. This limitation imposes two key constraints on existing methods: (1) LLM predictions become less reliable due to bias exploitation, and (2) despite strong knowledge reasoning capabilities, LLMs still struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. To address these issues, we propose Object Attribute Description Promoter (OAD-Promoter), a novel approach for enhancing LLM-based VQA by mitigating language bias and improving domain-shift robustness. OAD-Promoter comprises three components: the Object-concentrated Example Generation (OEG) module, the Memory Knowledge Assistance (MKA) module, and the OAD Prompt. The OEG module generates global captions and object-concentrated samples, jointly enhancing visual information input to the LLM and mitigating bias through complementary global and regional visual cues. The MKA module assists the LLM in handling OOD samples by retrieving relevant knowledge from stored examples to support questions from unseen domains. Finally, the OAD Prompt integrates the outputs of the preceding modules to optimize LLM inference. Experiments demonstrate that OAD-Promoter significantly improves the performance of LLM-based VQA methods in few-shot or zero-shot settings, achieving new state-of-the-art results.

*Karol C. Jurzec,Tomasz Szydlo,Maciej Wielgosz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级的基于C的SNN推理运行时，通过优化数据布局、预分配和稀疏性剪枝，在保持精度的同时显著提升了边缘设备上的SNN推理速度和内存效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNN的事件驱动特性在时序处理和能效方面具有优势，但在资源受限的边缘设备上的训练和部署仍然具有挑战性。需要开发高效的运行时系统来充分发挥SNN的潜力。

Method: 将SNNTorch训练的模型转换为紧凑的C表示，采用静态、缓存友好的数据布局和预分配避免解释器和分配开销。利用稀疏脉冲活动剪枝非活跃神经元和突触，减少上游卷积层的计算量。

Result: 在N-MNIST和ST-MNIST数据集上实现与Python基线的功能对等，在桌面CPU上获得约10倍加速，剪枝带来额外增益，内存大幅减少，可在微控制器（Arduino Portenta H7）上部署。

Conclusion: 当配备优化的运行时和脉冲驱动的模型压缩时，SNN可以在传统嵌入式平台上高效执行。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) communicate via discrete spikes in time rather than continuous activations. Their event-driven nature offers advantages for temporal processing and energy efficiency on resource-constrained hardware, but training and deployment remain challenging. We present a lightweight C-based runtime for SNN inference on edge devices and optimizations that reduce latency and memory without sacrificing accuracy. Trained models exported from SNNTorch are translated to a compact C representation; static, cache-friendly data layouts and preallocation avoid interpreter and allocation overheads. We further exploit sparse spiking activity to prune inactive neurons and synapses, shrinking computation in upstream convolutional layers. Experiments on N-MNIST and ST-MNIST show functional parity with the Python baseline while achieving ~10 speedups on desktop CPU and additional gains with pruning, together with large memory reductions that enable microcontroller deployment (Arduino Portenta H7). Results indicate that SNNs can be executed efficiently on conventional embedded platforms when paired with an optimized runtime and spike-driven model compression.

TL;DR: MAVIS是首个评估多模态源归属系统的基准，包含157K视觉问答实例，开发了信息量、基础性和流畅性的自动评估指标，发现多模态RAG比单模态RAG生成更信息丰富和流畅的答案，但在图像文档的基础性方面存在差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作主要关注纯文本场景，忽视了多模态在源归属中的作用，需要开发能够理解视觉问题意图、检索多模态证据并生成带引用的长答案的系统。

Method: 构建包含157K视觉问答实例的数据集，每个答案都有事实级引用指向多模态文档，开发三个维度的自动评估指标，比较不同提示方法下的多模态RAG系统性能。

Result: 多模态RAG比单模态RAG生成更信息丰富和流畅的答案，但在图像文档的基础性方面较弱；不同提示方法在信息量和基础性之间存在权衡；需要减轻图像文档解释中的上下文偏见。

Conclusion: 多模态源归属系统在信息量和流畅性方面表现更好，但在图像文档的基础性方面存在挑战，减轻上下文偏见是未来研究的关键方向。

Abstract: Source attribution aims to enhance the reliability of AI-generated answers by including references for each statement, helping users validate the provided answers. However, existing work has primarily focused on text-only scenario and largely overlooked the role of multimodality. We introduce MAVIS, the first benchmark designed to evaluate multimodal source attribution systems that understand user intent behind visual questions, retrieve multimodal evidence, and generate long-form answers with citations. Our dataset comprises 157K visual QA instances, where each answer is annotated with fact-level citations referring to multimodal documents. We develop fine-grained automatic metrics along three dimensions of informativeness, groundedness, and fluency, and demonstrate their strong correlation with human judgments. Our key findings are threefold: (1) LVLMs with multimodal RAG generate more informative and fluent answers than unimodal RAG, but they exhibit weaker groundedness for image documents than for text documents, a gap amplified in multimodal settings. (2) Given the same multimodal documents, there is a trade-off between informativeness and groundedness across different prompting methods. (3) Our proposed method highlights mitigating contextual bias in interpreting image documents as a crucial direction for future research. The dataset and experimental code are available at https://github.com/seokwon99/MAVIS

Motivation: 事件相机和脉冲神经网络结合具有能效优势，但事件数据稀缺且DVS输出稀疏阻碍有效训练。现有RGB到DVS的知识迁移方法因模态间分布差异大而表现不佳。

Method: 提出时间步混合知识转移框架，包含概率性时间步混合策略，在RGB和DVS输入的不同时间步进行插值，并引入模态感知指导和混合比感知两个轻量级目标函数。

Result: 在多个基准测试和不同SNN骨干网络上的广泛实验表明，该方法能实现更平滑的知识迁移，缓解训练中的模态不匹配问题，在脉冲图像分类任务中取得优越性能。

Conclusion: TMKT通过时间步混合和模态感知目标有效解决了跨模态知识迁移中的分布差异问题，为事件相机和脉冲神经网络的结合提供了有效的训练框架。

Abstract: The integration of event cameras and spiking neural networks (SNNs) promises energy-efficient visual intelligence, yet scarce event data and the sparsity of DVS outputs hinder effective training. Prior knowledge transfers from RGB to DVS often underperform because the distribution gap between modalities is substantial. In this work, we present Time-step Mixup Knowledge Transfer (TMKT), a cross-modal training framework with a probabilistic Time-step Mixup (TSM) strategy. TSM exploits the asynchronous nature of SNNs by interpolating RGB and DVS inputs at various time steps to produce a smooth curriculum within each sequence, which reduces gradient variance and stabilizes optimization with theoretical analysis. To employ auxiliary supervision from TSM, TMKT introduces two lightweight modality-aware objectives, Modality Aware Guidance (MAG) for per-frame source supervision and Mixup Ratio Perception (MRP) for sequence-level mix ratio estimation, which explicitly align temporal features with the mixing schedule. TMKT enables smoother knowledge transfer, helps mitigate modality mismatch during training, and achieves superior performance in spiking image classification tasks. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and multiple SNN backbones, together with ablations, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Method: 提出频率交互注意力框架，包含频率表示交互模块（在自注意力中交换源和目标特征的频率成分）和特征注入模块（在交叉注意力中显式注入源侧查询、键、值和文本嵌入）。

Conclusion: FIA-Edit实现了高效高保真的文本引导图像编辑，首次将该技术扩展到临床应用中，为医学数据增强开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Text-guided image editing has advanced rapidly with the rise of diffusion models. While flow-based inversion-free methods offer high efficiency by avoiding latent inversion, they often fail to effectively integrate source information, leading to poor background preservation, spatial inconsistencies, and over-editing due to the lack of effective integration of source information. In this paper, we present FIA-Edit, a novel inversion-free framework that achieves high-fidelity and semantically precise edits through a Frequency-Interactive Attention. Specifically, we design two key components: (1) a Frequency Representation Interaction (FRI) module that enhances cross-domain alignment by exchanging frequency components between source and target features within self-attention, and (2) a Feature Injection (FIJ) module that explicitly incorporates source-side queries, keys, values, and text embeddings into the target branch's cross-attention to preserve structure and semantics. Comprehensive and extensive experiments demonstrate that FIA-Edit supports high-fidelity editing at low computational cost (~6s per 512 * 512 image on an RTX 4090) and consistently outperforms existing methods across diverse tasks in visual quality, background fidelity, and controllability. Furthermore, we are the first to extend text-guided image editing to clinical applications. By synthesizing anatomically coherent hemorrhage variations in surgical images, FIA-Edit opens new opportunities for medical data augmentation and delivers significant gains in downstream bleeding classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于哈希中心的方法存在随机初始化忽略类间语义关系的问题，而两阶段方法虽然能缓解此问题但引入了额外复杂性和计算开销，且由于阶段间差异导致性能次优。

Method: CRH采用端到端框架，从预设码本中动态重新分配哈希中心，无需显式的中心优化阶段，同时使用多头机制增强哈希中心的表示能力。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，CRH能够学习到具有语义意义的哈希中心，并在检索任务中优于最先进的深度哈希方法。

Conclusion: CRH通过动态哈希中心重新分配和端到端优化，有效整合了语义关系，提升了哈希检索性能。

Abstract: Hash center-based deep hashing methods improve upon pairwise or triplet-based approaches by assigning fixed hash centers to each class as learning targets, thereby avoiding the inefficiency of local similarity optimization. However, random center initialization often disregards inter-class semantic relationships. While existing two-stage methods mitigate this by first refining hash centers with semantics and then training the hash function, they introduce additional complexity, computational overhead, and suboptimal performance due to stage-wise discrepancies. To address these limitations, we propose $\textbf{Center-Reassigned Hashing (CRH)}$, an end-to-end framework that $\textbf{dynamically reassigns hash centers}$ from a preset codebook while jointly optimizing the hash function. Unlike previous methods, CRH adapts hash centers to the data distribution $\textbf{without explicit center optimization phases}$, enabling seamless integration of semantic relationships into the learning process. Furthermore, $\textbf{a multi-head mechanism}$ enhances the representational capacity of hash centers, capturing richer semantic structures. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that CRH learns semantically meaningful hash centers and outperforms state-of-the-art deep hashing methods in retrieval tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于修复的补全方法由于几何和语义约束有限，容易产生结构不一致和拓扑伪影。需要重新思考任务范式，从无约束合成转向引导式精炼。

Method: 提出PGNet多阶段框架：进行双特征编码以锚定生成先验，合成结构对齐的粗粒度支架，通过分层校正逐步细化几何细节。

Result: 在ShapeNetViPC数据集上，PGNet在平均Chamfer距离上比现有最佳方法降低23.5%，F-score提升7.1%。

Conclusion: Completion-by-Correction范式通过引导式精炼而非无约束合成，能够实现更结构一致和观测对齐的点云补全效果。

Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to reconstruct complete 3D shapes from partial observations, which is a challenging problem due to severe occlusions and missing geometry. Despite recent advances in multimodal techniques that leverage complementary RGB images to compensate for missing geometry, most methods still follow a Completion-by-Inpainting paradigm, synthesizing missing structures from fused latent features. We empirically show that this paradigm often results in structural inconsistencies and topological artifacts due to limited geometric and semantic constraints. To address this, we rethink the task and propose a more robust paradigm, termed Completion-by-Correction, which begins with a topologically complete shape prior generated by a pretrained image-to-3D model and performs feature-space correction to align it with the partial observation. This paradigm shifts completion from unconstrained synthesis to guided refinement, enabling structurally consistent and observation-aligned reconstruction. Building upon this paradigm, we introduce PGNet, a multi-stage framework that conducts dual-feature encoding to ground the generative prior, synthesizes a coarse yet structurally aligned scaffold, and progressively refines geometric details via hierarchical correction. Experiments on the ShapeNetViPC dataset demonstrate the superiority of PGNet over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of average Chamfer Distance (-23.5%) and F-score (+7.1%).

Result: 实验表明DC-Mix策略在计算效率和生成保真度之间取得了良好平衡，TI-Mix带来了持续改进。

Conclusion: 混合离散和连续表示的自回归建模能够有效提升图像生成质量，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) approaches, which represent images as sequences of discrete tokens from a finite codebook, have achieved remarkable success in image generation. However, the quantization process and the limited codebook size inevitably discard fine-grained information, placing bottlenecks on fidelity. Motivated by this limitation, recent studies have explored autoregressive modeling in continuous latent spaces, which offers higher generation quality. Yet, unlike discrete tokens constrained by a fixed codebook, continuous representations lie in a vast and unstructured space, posing significant challenges for efficient autoregressive modeling. To address these challenges, we introduce MixAR, a novel framework that leverages mixture training paradigms to inject discrete tokens as prior guidance for continuous AR modeling. MixAR is a factorized formulation that leverages discrete tokens as prior guidance for continuous autoregressive prediction. We investigate several discrete-continuous mixture strategies, including self-attention (DC-SA), cross-attention (DC-CA), and a simple approach (DC-Mix) that replaces homogeneous mask tokens with informative discrete counterparts. Moreover, to bridge the gap between ground-truth training tokens and inference tokens produced by the pre-trained AR model, we propose Training-Inference Mixture (TI-Mix) to achieve consistent training and generation distributions. In our experiments, we demonstrate a favorable balance of the DC-Mix strategy between computational efficiency and generation fidelity, and consistent improvement of TI-Mix.

Abstract: Driver distraction remains a leading cause of road traffic accidents, contributing to thousands of fatalities annually across the globe. While deep learning-based driver activity recognition methods have shown promise in detecting such distractions, their effectiveness in real-world deployments is hindered by two critical challenges: variations in camera viewpoints (cross-view) and domain shifts such as change in sensor modality or environment. Existing methods typically address either cross-view generalization or unsupervised domain adaptation in isolation, leaving a gap in the robust and scalable deployment of models across diverse vehicle configurations. In this work, we propose a novel two-phase cross-view, cross-modal unsupervised domain adaptation framework that addresses these challenges jointly on real-time driver monitoring data. In the first phase, we learn view-invariant and action-discriminative features within a single modality using contrastive learning on multi-view data. In the second phase, we perform domain adaptation to a new modality using information bottleneck loss without requiring any labeled data from the new domain. We evaluate our approach using state-of-the art video transformers (Video Swin, MViT) and multi modal driver activity dataset called Drive&Act, demonstrating that our joint framework improves top-1 accuracy on RGB video data by almost 50% compared to a supervised contrastive learning-based cross-view method, and outperforms unsupervised domain adaptation-only methods by up to 5%, using the same video transformer backbone.

Abstract: Cross-domain Few-shot Segmentation (CD-FSS) aims to segment novel classes from target domains that are not involved in training and have significantly different data distributions from the source domain, using only a few annotated samples, and recent years have witnessed significant progress on this task. However, existing CD-FSS methods primarily focus on style gaps between source and target domains while ignoring segmentation granularity gaps, resulting in insufficient semantic discriminability for novel classes in target domains. Therefore, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic Learning (HSL) framework to tackle this problem. Specifically, we introduce a Dual Style Randomization (DSR) module and a Hierarchical Semantic Mining (HSM) module to learn hierarchical semantic features, thereby enhancing the model's ability to recognize semantics at varying granularities. DSR simulates target domain data with diverse foreground-background style differences and overall style variations through foreground and global style randomization respectively, while HSM leverages multi-scale superpixels to guide the model to mine intra-class consistency and inter-class distinction at different granularities. Additionally, we also propose a Prototype Confidence-modulated Thresholding (PCMT) module to mitigate segmentation ambiguity when foreground and background are excessively similar. Extensive experiments are conducted on four popular target domain datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: OmniSparse框架有效解决了训练-推理差距问题，通过细粒度token选择在多个维度上实现了显著的加速和内存优化，同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Existing sparse attention methods primarily target inference-time acceleration by selecting critical tokens under predefined sparsity patterns. However, they often fail to bridge the training-inference gap and lack the capacity for fine-grained token selection across multiple dimensions such as queries, key-values (KV), and heads, leading to suboptimal performance and limited acceleration gains. In this paper, we introduce OmniSparse, a training-aware fine-grained sparse attention framework for long-video MLLMs, which operates in both training and inference with dynamic token budget allocation. Specifically, OmniSparse contains three adaptive and complementary mechanisms: (1) query selection via lazy-active classification, retaining active queries that capture broad semantic similarity while discarding most lazy ones that focus on limited local context and exhibit high functional redundancy; (2) KV selection with head-level dynamic budget allocation, where a shared budget is determined based on the flattest head and applied uniformly across all heads to ensure attention recall; and (3) KV cache slimming to reduce head-level redundancy by selectively fetching visual KV cache according to the head-level decoding query pattern. Experimental results show that OmniSparse matches the performance of full attention while achieving up to 2.7x speedup during prefill and 2.4x memory reduction during decoding.

Conclusion: LSS3D方法能有效处理多视图不一致性和非正面输入，生成具有完整几何细节和清晰纹理的高质量3D模型

Abstract: Recently, multi-view diffusion-based 3D generation methods have gained significant attention. However, these methods often suffer from shape and texture misalignment across generated multi-view images, leading to low-quality 3D generation results, such as incomplete geometric details and textural ghosting. Some methods are mainly optimized for the frontal perspective and exhibit poor robustness to oblique perspective inputs. In this paper, to tackle the above challenges, we propose a high-quality image-to-3D approach, named LSS3D, with learnable spatial shifting to explicitly and effectively handle the multiview inconsistencies and non-frontal input view. Specifically, we assign learnable spatial shifting parameters to each view, and adjust each view towards a spatially consistent target, guided by the reconstructed mesh, resulting in high-quality 3D generation with more complete geometric details and clean textures. Besides, we include the input view as an extra constraint for the optimization, further enhancing robustness to non-frontal input angles, especially for elevated viewpoint inputs. We also provide a comprehensive quantitative evaluation pipeline that can contribute to the community in performance comparisons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently achieves leading results in both geometric and texture evaluation metrics across more flexible input viewpoints.

Abstract: Multi-view image generation holds significant application value in computer vision, particularly in domains like 3D reconstruction, virtual reality, and augmented reality. Most existing methods, which rely on extending single images, face notable computational challenges in maintaining cross-view consistency and generating high-resolution outputs. To address these issues, we propose the Geometry-guided Multi-View Diffusion Model, which incorporates mechanisms for extracting multi-view geometric information and adjusting the intensity of geometric features to generate images that are both consistent across views and rich in detail. Specifically, we design a multi-view geometry information extraction module that leverages depth maps, normal maps, and foreground segmentation masks to construct a shared geometric structure, ensuring shape and structural consistency across different views. To enhance consistency and detail restoration during generation, we develop a decoupled geometry-enhanced attention mechanism that strengthens feature focus on key geometric details, thereby improving overall image quality and detail preservation. Furthermore, we apply an adaptive learning strategy that fine-tunes the model to better capture spatial relationships and visual coherence between the generated views, ensuring realistic results. Our model also incorporates an iterative refinement process that progressively improves the output quality through multiple stages of image generation. Finally, a dynamic geometry information intensity adjustment mechanism is proposed to adaptively regulate the influence of geometric data, optimizing overall quality while ensuring the naturalness of generated images.

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了一个实用有效的自动化交通规则执法解决方案，讨论了实际部署的考虑因素，为道路安全提供了重要技术支撑。

Abstract: Road safety is a critical global concern, with manual enforcement of helmet laws and vehicle safety standards (e.g., rear-view mirror presence) being resource-intensive and inconsistent. This paper presents an AI-powered system to automate traffic violation detection, significantly enhancing enforcement efficiency and road safety. The system leverages YOLOv8 for robust object detection and EasyOCR for license plate recognition. Trained on a custom dataset of annotated images (augmented for diversity), it identifies helmet non-compliance, the absence of rear-view mirrors on motorcycles, an innovative contribution to automated checks, and extracts vehicle registration numbers. A Streamlit-based interface facilitates real-time monitoring and violation logging. Advanced image preprocessing enhances license plate recognition, particularly under challenging conditions. Based on evaluation results, the model achieves an overall precision of 0.9147, a recall of 0.886, and a mean Average Precision (mAP@50) of 0.843. The mAP@50 95 of 0.503 further indicates strong detection capability under stricter IoU thresholds. This work demonstrates a practical and effective solution for automated traffic rule enforcement, with considerations for real-world deployment discussed.

TL;DR: MoS是一种新颖的多模态扩散模型融合范式，通过可学习的token级路由器在模态间创建状态交互，实现高效的多模态融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态扩散模型通常需要大量参数才能实现高质量融合，MoS旨在开发一种灵活且计算高效的融合范式，用更少的参数达到或超越更大模型的性能。

Method: 使用可学习的token级路由器，根据去噪时间步和输入创建模态间隐藏状态的交互，通过top-k稀疏选择和ε-greedy训练策略，以最小可学习参数和计算开销选择上下文特征。

Result: 在文本到图像生成和编辑任务中达到最先进水平，仅用3B到5B参数就能匹配或超越参数多达4倍的模型。

Conclusion: MoS为扩展多模态扩散模型提供了一种灵活且计算高效的范式，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了模型复杂度。

Abstract: We introduce MoS (Mixture of States), a novel fusion paradigm for multimodal diffusion models that merges modalities using flexible, state-based interactions. The core of MoS is a learnable, token-wise router that creates denoising timestep- and input-dependent interactions between modalities' hidden states, precisely aligning token-level features with the diffusion trajectory. This router sparsely selects the top-$k$ hidden states and is trained with an $ε$-greedy strategy, efficiently selecting contextual features with minimal learnable parameters and negligible computational overhead. We validate our design with text-to-image generation (MoS-Image) and editing (MoS-Editing), which achieve state-of-the-art results. With only 3B to 5B parameters, our models match or surpass counterparts up to $4\times$ larger. These findings establish MoS as a flexible and compute-efficient paradigm for scaling multimodal diffusion models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FaNe是一个语义增强的医学视觉语言预训练框架，通过语义感知的正样本挖掘、文本条件稀疏注意力池化和硬负样本感知对比损失，解决了假阴性问题和细粒度跨模态对齐不足的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的医学视觉语言预训练方法受到语义相似文本导致的假阴性问题和细粒度跨模态对齐不足的限制。

Method: 1. 基于文本-文本相似度的语义感知正样本挖掘策略；2. 文本条件稀疏注意力池化模块实现细粒度图像-文本对齐；3. 硬负样本感知对比损失增强模态内区分度。

Result: 在五个下游医学影像基准测试中，FaNe在图像分类、目标检测和语义分割任务上均达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FaNe框架通过解决假阴性问题和提升细粒度跨模态对齐，有效推进了医学图像理解的发展。

Abstract: Medical vision-language pre-training (VLP) offers significant potential for advancing medical image understanding by leveraging paired image-report data. However, existing methods are limited by Fa}lse Negatives (FaNe) induced by semantically similar texts and insufficient fine-grained cross-modal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose FaNe, a semantic-enhanced VLP framework. To mitigate false negatives, we introduce a semantic-aware positive pair mining strategy based on text-text similarity with adaptive normalization. Furthermore, we design a text-conditioned sparse attention pooling module to enable fine-grained image-text alignment through localized visual representations guided by textual cues. To strengthen intra-modal discrimination, we develop a hard-negative aware contrastive loss that adaptively reweights semantically similar negatives. Extensive experiments on five downstream medical imaging benchmarks demonstrate that FaNe achieves state-of-the-art performance across image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, validating the effectiveness of our framework.

### [86] [Suppressing VLM Hallucinations with Spectral Representation Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12220)
*Ameen Ali,Tamim Zoabi,Lior Wolf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Spectral Representation Filtering (SRF)方法，通过分析模型表示的协方差结构来抑制视觉语言模型中的幻觉现象，无需训练且不增加推理开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型经常产生幻觉，描述图像中不存在的对象、属性或关系，这源于对语言先验的过度依赖和不精确的跨模态对齐。

Method: 通过特征协方差的特征分解识别低秩幻觉模式，使用软光谱滤波器在深层vLLM层的前馈投影权重中衰减这些模式，均衡特征方差同时保持语义保真度。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5、MiniGPT-4和mPLUG-Owl2等VLM模型上，SRF在MSCOCO、POPE-VQA等基准测试中持续降低幻觉率，达到最先进的忠实度且不降低描述质量。

Conclusion: SRF是一种轻量级、无需训练的后处理方法，能有效抑制VLM幻觉，无需架构修改且零推理开销。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) frequently produce hallucinations in the form of descriptions of objects, attributes, or relations that do not exist in the image due to over-reliance on language priors and imprecise cross-modal grounding. We introduce Spectral Representation Filtering (SRF), a lightweight, training-free method to suppress such hallucinations by analyzing and correcting the covariance structure of the model's representations. SRF identifies low-rank hallucination modes through eigendecomposition of the covariance of the differences between features collected for truthful and hallucinatory captions, revealing structured biases in the feature space. A soft spectral filter then attenuates these modes in the feed-forward projection weights of deeper vLLM layers, equalizing feature variance while preserving semantic fidelity. Unlike decoding or retraining-based approaches, SRF operates entirely post-hoc, incurs zero inference overhead, and requires no architectural modifications. Across three families of VLMs (LLaVA-1.5, MiniGPT-4, and mPLUG-Owl2), SRF consistently reduces hallucination rates on MSCOCO, POPE-VQA, and other visual tasks benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art faithfulness without degrading caption quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DHMI，首个针对深度哈希的扩散模型反演框架，能够在黑盒设置下成功重构高质量图像，揭示了深度哈希系统的严重隐私风险


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度哈希虽然提高了检索效率，但带来了严重的隐私风险，现有方法无法适应深度哈希模型，且针对深度哈希的模型反演攻击尚未被探索

Method: DHMI首先对辅助数据集进行聚类得到语义哈希中心作为代理锚点，然后引入代理引导的去噪优化方法，结合分类一致性和哈希接近度的新攻击指标动态选择候选样本，通过代理模型集群指导候选样本的细化

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，DHMI即使在最具挑战性的黑盒设置下也能成功重构高分辨率、高质量图像，在黑盒场景下优于现有最先进的模型反演攻击方法

Conclusion: DHMI证实了深度哈希系统固有的关键隐私风险，并展示了其在实际应用中的有效性

Abstract: Deep hashing improves retrieval efficiency through compact binary codes, yet it introduces severe and often overlooked privacy risks. The ability to reconstruct original training data from hash codes could lead to serious threats such as biometric forgery and privacy breaches. However, model inversion attacks specifically targeting deep hashing models remain unexplored, leaving their security implications unexamined. This research gap stems from the inaccessibility of genuine training hash codes and the highly discrete Hamming space, which prevents existing methods from adapting to deep hashing. To address these challenges, we propose DHMI, the first diffusion-based model inversion framework designed for deep hashing. DHMI first clusters an auxiliary dataset to derive semantic hash centers as surrogate anchors. It then introduces a surrogate-guided denoising optimization method that leverages a novel attack metric (fusing classification consistency and hash proximity) to dynamically select candidate samples. A cluster of surrogate models guides the refinement of these candidates, ensuring the generation of high-fidelity and semantically consistent images. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that DHMI successfully reconstructs high-resolution, high-quality images even under the most challenging black-box setting, where no training hash codes are available. Our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art model inversion attacks in black-box scenarios, confirming both its practical efficacy and the critical privacy risks inherent in deep hashing systems.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，在临床准确性和语言质量方面均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该疾病感知框架能够有效提升胸部X光报告生成的性能，满足医学图像分析的专业要求。

Abstract: Radiology report generation from chest X-rays is an important task in artificial intelligence with the potential to greatly reduce radiologists' workload and shorten patient wait times. Despite recent advances, existing approaches often lack sufficient disease-awareness in visual representations and adequate vision-language alignment to meet the specialized requirements of medical image analysis. As a result, these models usually overlook critical pathological features on chest X-rays and struggle to generate clinically accurate reports. To address these limitations, we propose a novel dual-stage disease-aware framework for chest X-ray report generation. In Stage~1, our model learns Disease-Aware Semantic Tokens (DASTs) corresponding to specific pathology categories through cross-attention mechanisms and multi-label classification, while simultaneously aligning vision and language representations via contrastive learning. In Stage~2, we introduce a Disease-Visual Attention Fusion (DVAF) module to integrate disease-aware representations with visual features, along with a Dual-Modal Similarity Retrieval (DMSR) mechanism that combines visual and disease-specific similarities to retrieve relevant exemplars, providing contextual guidance during report generation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets (i.e., CheXpert Plus, IU X-ray, and MIMIC-CXR) demonstrate that our disease-aware framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in chest X-ray report generation, with significant improvements in clinical accuracy and linguistic quality.

Motivation: 现有视频理解基准主要关注单视频分析，无法评估MLLMs同时推理多个视频的能力。虽然近期有基准评估多视角视频，但其有限任务无法全面评估MLLMs在多样化真实世界跨视频推理场景中的表现。

Method: 构建CrossVid基准，包含广泛的分层任务（4个高级维度和10个具体任务），提供5331个视频和9015个具有挑战性的问答对，涵盖单选、多选和开放式问题格式。

Result: 在各种开源和闭源MLLMs上的广泛实验表明，Gemini-2.5-Pro在CrossVid上表现最佳，平均准确率为50.4%。深入案例研究显示大多数当前MLLMs在跨视频推理任务中表现挣扎。

Conclusion: CrossVid基准有潜力指导未来增强MLLMs跨视频推理能力的进展，当前MLLMs的主要挑战在于无法整合或比较分布在多个视频中的证据进行推理。

Abstract: Cross-Video Reasoning (CVR) presents a significant challenge in video understanding, which requires simultaneous understanding of multiple videos to aggregate and compare information across groups of videos. Most existing video understanding benchmarks focus on single-video analysis, failing to assess the ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to simultaneously reason over various videos. Recent benchmarks evaluate MLLMs' capabilities on multi-view videos that capture different perspectives of the same scene. However, their limited tasks hinder a thorough assessment of MLLMs in diverse real-world CVR scenarios. To this end, we introduce CrossVid, the first benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal reasoning ability in cross-video contexts. Firstly, CrossVid encompasses a wide spectrum of hierarchical tasks, comprising four high-level dimensions and ten specific tasks, thereby closely reflecting the complex and varied nature of real-world video understanding. Secondly, CrossVid provides 5,331 videos, along with 9,015 challenging question-answering pairs, spanning single-choice, multiple-choice, and open-ended question formats. Through extensive experiments on various open-source and closed-source MLLMs, we observe that Gemini-2.5-Pro performs best on CrossVid, achieving an average accuracy of 50.4%. Notably, our in-depth case study demonstrates that most current MLLMs struggle with CVR tasks, primarily due to their inability to integrate or compare evidence distributed across multiple videos for reasoning. These insights highlight the potential of CrossVid to guide future advancements in enhancing MLLMs' CVR capabilities.

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) remote sensing (RS) images offer rich fine-grained information but also present challenges in effective processing. Existing dynamic resolution and token pruning methods are constrained by a passive perception paradigm, suffering from increased redundancy when obtaining finer visual inputs. In this work, we explore a new active perception paradigm that enables models to revisit information-rich regions. First, we present LRS-GRO, a large-scale benchmark dataset tailored for active perception in UHR RS processing, encompassing 17 question types across global, region, and object levels, annotated via a semi-automatic pipeline. Building on LRS-GRO, we propose ZoomEarth, an adaptive cropping-zooming framework with a novel Region-Guided reward that provides fine-grained guidance. Trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), ZoomEarth achieves state-of-the-art performance on LRS-GRO and, in the zero-shot setting, on three public UHR remote sensing benchmarks. Furthermore, ZoomEarth can be seamlessly integrated with downstream models for tasks such as cloud removal, denoising, segmentation, and image editing through simple tool interfaces, demonstrating strong versatility and extensibility.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is essential for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Although transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable results, their high computational cost hinders clinical deployment. To address this issue, we propose TM-UNet, a novel lightweight framework that integrates token sequence modeling with an efficient memory mechanism for efficient medical segmentation. Specifically, we introduce a multi-scale token-memory (MSTM) block that transforms 2D spatial features into token sequences through strategic spatial scanning, leveraging matrix memory cells to selectively retain and propagate discriminative contextual information across tokens. This novel token-memory mechanism acts as a dynamic knowledge store that captures long-range dependencies with linear complexity, enabling efficient global reasoning without redundant computation. Our MSTM block further incorporates exponential gating to identify token effectiveness and multi-scale contextual extraction via parallel pooling operations, enabling hierarchical representation learning without computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TM-UNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse medical segmentation tasks with substantially reduced computation cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散式多模态大语言模型虽然具有强大的非自回归生成能力，但推理速度显著慢于自回归模型，因为每个去噪步骤都需要对整个序列进行双向自注意力计算，导致立方级解码复杂度

Method: 提出基于决策器引导的动态token合并方法，在每个去噪步骤使用前一步生成的决策器token构建重要性映射，保留最显著的token并通过相似性聚合合并其余token

Result: 实验表明D³ToM能够显著加速推理速度，同时在相同计算预算下保持竞争性性能

Conclusion: D³ToM是一种即插即用的模块，无需改变模型参数即可物理缩短视觉token序列，有效解决了扩散式多模态大语言模型推理速度慢的问题

Abstract: Diffusion-based multimodal large language models (Diffusion MLLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive non-autoregressive generative capabilities across vision-and-language tasks. However, Diffusion MLLMs exhibit substantially slower inference than autoregressive models: Each denoising step employs full bidirectional self-attention over the entire sequence, resulting in cubic decoding complexity that becomes computationally impractical with thousands of visual tokens. To address this challenge, we propose D$^{3}$ToM, a Decider-guided dynamic token merging method that dynamically merges redundant visual tokens at different denoising steps to accelerate inference in Diffusion MLLMs. At each denoising step, D$^{3}$ToM uses decider tokens-the tokens generated in the previous denoising step-to build an importance map over all visual tokens. Then it maintains a proportion of the most salient tokens and merges the remainder through similarity-based aggregation. This plug-and-play module integrates into a single transformer layer, physically shortening the visual token sequence for all subsequent layers without altering model parameters. Moreover, D$^{3}$ToM employs a merge ratio that dynamically varies with each denoising step, aligns with the native decoding process of Diffusion MLLMs, achieving superior performance under equivalent computational budgets. Extensive experiments show that D$^{3}$ToM accelerates inference while preserving competitive performance. The code is released at https://github.com/bcmi/D3ToM-Diffusion-MLLM.

Abstract: We present a novel multi-modal extrinsic calibration framework designed to simultaneously estimate the relative poses between event cameras, LiDARs, and RGB cameras, with particular focus on the challenging event camera calibration. Core of our approach is a novel 3D calibration target, specifically designed and constructed to be concurrently perceived by all three sensing modalities. The target encodes features in planes, ChArUco, and active LED patterns, each tailored to the unique characteristics of LiDARs, RGB cameras, and event cameras respectively. This unique design enables a one-shot, joint extrinsic calibration process, in contrast to existing approaches that typically rely on separate, pairwise calibrations. Our calibration pipeline is designed to accurately calibrate complex vision systems in the context of autonomous driving, where precise multi-sensor alignment is critical. We validate our approach through an extensive experimental evaluation on a custom built dataset, recorded with an advanced autonomous driving sensor setup, confirming the accuracy and robustness of our method.

TL;DR: 本文提出了频率重校准(FreRec)方法来解决医学图像生成数据增强(GDA)中的频率分布偏差问题，通过统计高频替换(SHR)和重构高频映射(RHM)来改善合成图像质量，提升下游医学图像分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学AI开发依赖大数据但常面临数据稀缺问题，生成数据增强(GDA)可合成医学图像但存在频率分布偏差风险，可能损害下游任务性能。

Method: 提出FreRec方法：1) 统计高频替换(SHR)粗略对齐高频分量；2) 重构高频映射(RHM)提升图像质量并重建高频细节。该方法可作为独立后处理步骤与任何生成模型兼容。

Result: 在脑部MRI、胸部X光和眼底图像等多种医学数据集上的实验表明，FreRec显著提升了基于AI合成样本的下游医学图像分类性能。

Conclusion: FreRec能有效减少频率分布差异，改善生成数据增强的可靠性，且与常见医学GDA流程无缝集成。

Abstract: Developing Medical AI relies on large datasets and easily suffers from data scarcity. Generative data augmentation (GDA) using AI generative models offers a solution to synthesize realistic medical images. However, the bias in GDA is often underestimated in medical domains, with concerns about the risk of introducing detrimental features generated by AI and harming downstream tasks. This paper identifies the frequency misalignment between real and synthesized images as one of the key factors underlying unreliable GDA and proposes the Frequency Recalibration (FreRec) method to reduce the frequency distributional discrepancy and thus improve GDA. FreRec involves (1) Statistical High-frequency Replacement (SHR) to roughly align high-frequency components and (2) Reconstructive High-frequency Mapping (RHM) to enhance image quality and reconstruct high-frequency details. Extensive experiments were conducted in various medical datasets, including brain MRIs, chest X-rays, and fundus images. The results show that FreRec significantly improves downstream medical image classification performance compared to uncalibrated AI-synthesized samples. FreRec is a standalone post-processing step that is compatible with any generative model and can integrate seamlessly with common medical GDA pipelines.

Conclusion: DenseAnnotate平台为未来视觉语言研究提供了可行的密集标注方法，可应用于各种任务和数据类型，有效解决了传统标注方法的局限性。

Abstract: With the rapid adoption of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across diverse applications, there is a pressing need for task-centered, high-quality training data. A key limitation of current training datasets is their reliance on sparse annotations mined from the Internet or entered via manual typing that capture only a fraction of an image's visual content. Dense annotations are more valuable but remain scarce. Traditional text-based annotation pipelines are poorly suited for creating dense annotations: typing limits expressiveness, slows annotation speed, and underrepresents nuanced visual features, especially in specialized areas such as multicultural imagery and 3D asset annotation. In this paper, we present DenseAnnotate, an audio-driven online annotation platform that enables efficient creation of dense, fine-grained annotations for images and 3D assets. Annotators narrate observations aloud while synchronously linking spoken phrases to image regions or 3D scene parts. Our platform incorporates speech-to-text transcription and region-of-attention marking. To demonstrate the effectiveness of DenseAnnotate, we conducted case studies involving over 1,000 annotators across two domains: culturally diverse images and 3D scenes. We curate a human-annotated multi-modal dataset of 3,531 images, 898 3D scenes, and 7,460 3D objects, with audio-aligned dense annotations in 20 languages, including 8,746 image captions, 2,000 scene captions, and 19,000 object captions. Models trained on this dataset exhibit improvements of 5% in multilingual, 47% in cultural alignment, and 54% in 3D spatial capabilities. Our results show that our platform offers a feasible approach for future vision-language research and can be applied to various tasks and diverse types of data.

Motivation: 现有的基于高斯泼溅的LiDAR渲染方法在单次遍历扫描的不完整重建下，外推新视角合成时会出现伪影，限制了其应用效果。

Method: 提出可控的LiDAR生成模型，基于粗略外推渲染生成额外的几何一致扫描，并采用有效的蒸馏机制进行扩展重建，将重建范围扩展到欠拟合区域。

Conclusion: 通过扩散先验增强的LiDAR-GS++方法能够确保外推新视角的全局几何一致性，同时保留传感器捕获的详细场景表面。

Abstract: Recent GS-based rendering has made significant progress for LiDAR, surpassing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) in both quality and speed. However, these methods exhibit artifacts in extrapolated novel view synthesis due to the incomplete reconstruction from single traversal scans. To address this limitation, we present LiDAR-GS++, a LiDAR Gaussian Splatting reconstruction method enhanced by diffusion priors for real-time and high-fidelity re-simulation on public urban roads. Specifically, we introduce a controllable LiDAR generation model conditioned on coarsely extrapolated rendering to produce extra geometry-consistent scans and employ an effective distillation mechanism for expansive reconstruction. By extending reconstruction to under-fitted regions, our approach ensures global geometric consistency for extrapolative novel views while preserving detailed scene surfaces captured by sensors. Experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that LiDAR-GS++ achieves state-of-the-art performance for both interpolated and extrapolated viewpoints, surpassing existing GS and NeRF-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界视觉数据通常随时间逐渐演变，但传统分类器基于时序独立性假设训练，无法捕捉这种动态变化。需要在不改变模型架构的情况下为分类器添加时序推理能力。

Method: 采用支持-样本-查询(SEQ)学习范式，将训练数据组织成时序连贯的轨迹。学习类别特定的时序原型，使用可微分的soft-DTW损失对齐预测序列，并通过多目标函数促进语义一致性和时序平滑性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过损失设计引入了强大的时序归纳偏置，以模块化和数据高效的方式桥接了静态和时序学习，仅需在预提取特征上使用简单分类器。

Abstract: Real-world visual data rarely presents as isolated, static instances. Instead, it often evolves gradually over time through variations in pose, lighting, object state, or scene context. However, conventional classifiers are typically trained under the assumption of temporal independence, limiting their ability to capture such dynamics. We propose a simple yet effective framework that equips standard feedforward classifiers with temporal reasoning, all without modifying model architectures or introducing recurrent modules. At the heart of our approach is a novel Support-Exemplar-Query (SEQ) learning paradigm, which structures training data into temporally coherent trajectories. These trajectories enable the model to learn class-specific temporal prototypes and align prediction sequences via a differentiable soft-DTW loss. A multi-term objective further promotes semantic consistency and temporal smoothness. By interpreting input sequences as evolving feature trajectories, our method introduces a strong temporal inductive bias through loss design alone. This proves highly effective in both static and temporal tasks: it enhances performance on fine-grained and ultra-fine-grained image classification, and delivers precise, temporally consistent predictions in video anomaly detection. Despite its simplicity, our approach bridges static and temporal learning in a modular and data-efficient manner, requiring only a simple classifier on top of pre-extracted features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在处理否定提示时表现不佳，而通过微调大否定数据集的方法往往会损害模型在肯定提示上的零样本性能。

Method: 将否定建模为联合嵌入空间中的子空间，构造两个球形区域分别围绕肯定描述A和否定描述N的嵌入，通过寻找既接近A又远离N的区域中心方向来匹配图像。

Result: 在检索、多项选择和文本到图像任务中，该方法平均比现有方法提升了约30%的否定理解能力，同时保持了零样本性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功弥合了肯定和否定提示之间的性能差距，且无需训练即可维持零样本能力，解决了微调模型的性能损失问题。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with negation. Given a prompt like "retrieve (or generate) a street scene without pedestrians," they often fail to respect the "not." Existing methods address this limitation by fine-tuning on large negation datasets, but such retraining often compromises the model's zero-shot performance on affirmative prompts. We show that the embedding space of VLMs, such as CLIP, can be divided into semantically consistent subspaces. Based on this property, we propose a training-free framework that models negation as a subspace in the joint embedding space rather than a single point (Figure 1). To find the matching image for a caption such as "A but not N," we construct two spherical caps around the embeddings of A and N, and we score images by the central direction of the region that is close to A and far from N. Across retrieval, MCQ, and text-to-image tasks, our method improves negation understanding by about 30% on average over prior methods. It closes the gap between affirmative and negated prompts while preserving the zero-shot performance that fine-tuned models fail to maintain. Code will be released upon publication.

Method: 将单摄像头或多摄像头检测到的车辆反投影到地面平面，在真实世界3D坐标中进行分析，并通过多摄像头的弱融合技术提高精度。

Result: 单摄像头系统的反投影方法能提供更准确的轨迹分类和转弯运动计数，多摄像头弱融合系统能实现更高的精度。

Conclusion: 交通分析应该在地面平面进行，而不是在图像平面，这能显著提高转弯运动计数的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate turning movement counts at intersections are important for signal control, traffic management and urban planning. Computer vision systems for automatic turning movement counts typically rely on visual analysis in the image plane of an infrastructure camera. Here we explore potential advantages of back-projecting vehicles detected in one or more infrastructure cameras to the ground plane for analysis in real-world 3D coordinates. For single-camera systems we find that back-projection yields more accurate trajectory classification and turning movement counts. We further show that even higher accuracy can be achieved through weak fusion of back-projected detections from multiple cameras. These results suggeest that traffic should be analyzed on the ground plane, not the image plane

Motivation: 解决高光谱图像分类面临的高光谱维度、复杂光谱-空间相关性、训练样本有限且类别不平衡等关键挑战。

Method: 使用多尺度卷积主干和增强的卷积块注意力模块提取层次空间特征，然后通过结合双向RNN和多尺度光谱潜在注意力的光谱编码层，将复杂度从O(T²D)降低到O(Tlog(T)D)。

Result: 在Indian Pines和Salinas数据集上分别达到99.71%和99.96%的总体准确率，显著超越HybridSN、SSRN和SpectralFormer等方法。

Conclusion: CLAReSNet在有限样本和严重类别不平衡条件下表现出色，学习到的嵌入具有优越的类间可分性和紧凑的类内聚类。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification faces critical challenges, including high spectral dimensionality, complex spectral-spatial correlations, and limited training samples with severe class imbalance. While CNNs excel at local feature extraction and transformers capture long-range dependencies, their isolated application yields suboptimal results due to quadratic complexity and insufficient inductive biases. We propose CLAReSNet (Convolutional Latent Attention Residual Spectral Network), a hybrid architecture that integrates multi-scale convolutional extraction with transformer-style attention via an adaptive latent bottleneck. The model employs a multi-scale convolutional stem with deep residual blocks and an enhanced Convolutional Block Attention Module for hierarchical spatial features, followed by spectral encoder layers combining bidirectional RNNs (LSTM/GRU) with Multi-Scale Spectral Latent Attention (MSLA). MSLA reduces complexity from $\mathcal{O}(T^2D)$ to $\mathcal{O}(T\log(T)D)$ by adaptive latent token allocation (8-64 tokens) that scales logarithmically with the sequence length. Hierarchical cross-attention fusion dynamically aggregates multi-level representations for robust classification. Experiments conducted on the Indian Pines and Salinas datasets show state-of-the-art performance, achieving overall accuracies of 99.71% and 99.96%, significantly surpassing HybridSN, SSRN, and SpectralFormer. The learned embeddings exhibit superior inter-class separability and compact intra-class clustering, validating CLAReSNet's effectiveness under limited samples and severe class imbalance.

TL;DR: XAIGID-RewardBench是首个评估MLLMs判断AI生成图像检测解释质量的基准，包含约3000个标注三元组，结果显示当前最佳模型得分88.76%，与人类98.30%的标注一致性仍有差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于分类的AI生成图像检测方法无法像人类专家那样解释判断依据，降低了检测工具的可信度和说服力。虽然MLLMs成为解决此问题的趋势方案，但MLLMs在判断自身或其他MLLMs生成的解释质量方面的表现尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 构建包含约3000个标注三元组的基准数据集，这些数据来自各种图像生成模型和作为检测器的MLLMs，用于评估当前MLLMs作为奖励模型（评判者）的能力。

Result: 当前最佳奖励模型在该基准上得分为88.76%，而人类标注者间一致性达到98.30%，表明当前MLLMs的推理能力与人类水平仍存在明显差距。

Conclusion: MLLMs在判断AI生成图像检测解释质量方面仍有改进空间，需要进一步提升其推理能力以达到人类水平表现。

Abstract: Conventional, classification-based AI-generated image detection methods cannot explain why an image is considered real or AI-generated in a way a human expert would, which reduces the trustworthiness and persuasiveness of these detection tools for real-world applications. Leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has recently become a trending solution to this issue. Further, to evaluate the quality of generated explanations, a common approach is to adopt an "MLLM as a judge" methodology to evaluate explanations generated by other MLLMs. However, how well those MLLMs perform when judging explanations for AI-generated image detection generated by themselves or other MLLMs has not been well studied. We therefore propose \textbf{XAIGID-RewardBench}, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of current MLLMs to judge the quality of explanations about whether an image is real or AI-generated. The benchmark consists of approximately 3,000 annotated triplets sourced from various image generation models and MLLMs as policy models (detectors) to assess the capabilities of current MLLMs as reward models (judges). Our results show that the current best reward model scored 88.76\% on this benchmark (while human inter-annotator agreement reaches 98.30\%), demonstrating that a visible gap remains between the reasoning abilities of today's MLLMs and human-level performance. In addition, we provide an analysis of common pitfalls that these models frequently encounter. Code and benchmark are available at https://github.com/RewardBench/XAIGID-RewardBench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉推理方法依赖任务特定的架构和监督微调，缺乏统一解决方案，限制了跨任务和跨模态的泛化能力。

Method: 使用GRPO强化学习算法，结合验证结构完整性和输出准确性的新型奖励机制，训练LLM构建数字孪生表示。

Result: 在六个视觉推理基准测试中，涵盖两种模态和四种任务类型，DT-R1始终优于最先进的任务特定模型。

Conclusion: DT-R1开创了通过数字孪生表示的强化学习实现视觉推理的新方向。

Abstract: Visual reasoning may require models to interpret images and videos and respond to implicit text queries across diverse output formats, from pixel-level segmentation masks to natural language descriptions. Existing approaches rely on supervised fine-tuning with task-specific architectures. For example, reasoning segmentation, grounding, summarization, and visual question answering each demand distinct model designs and training, preventing unified solutions and limiting cross-task and cross-modality generalization. Hence, we propose DT-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that trains large language models to construct digital twin representations of complex multi-modal visual inputs and then reason over these high-level representations as a unified approach to visual reasoning. Specifically, we train DT-R1 using GRPO with a novel reward that validates both structural integrity and output accuracy. Evaluations in six visual reasoning benchmarks, covering two modalities and four task types, demonstrate that DT-R1 consistently achieves improvements over state-of-the-art task-specific models. DT-R1 opens a new direction where visual reasoning emerges from reinforcement learning with digital twin representations.

Conclusion: FastReasonSeg实现了高效的推理分割，能够在资源受限环境中部署，支持实时推理分割应用。

Abstract: Reasoning segmentation enables open-set object segmentation via implicit text queries, therefore serving as a foundation for embodied agents that should operate autonomously in real-world environments. However, existing methods for reasoning segmentation require multimodal large language models with billions of parameters that exceed the computational capabilities of edge devices that typically deploy the embodied AI systems. Distillation offers a pathway to compress these models while preserving their capabilities. Yet, existing distillation approaches fail to transfer the multi-step reasoning capabilities that reasoning segmentation demands, as they focus on matching output predictions and intermediate features rather than preserving reasoning chains. The emerging paradigm of reasoning over digital twin representations presents an opportunity for more effective distillation by re-framing the problem. Consequently, we propose FastReasonSeg, which employs digital twin representations that decouple perception from reasoning to enable more effective distillation. Our distillation scheme first relies on supervised fine-tuning on teacher-generated reasoning chains. Then it is followed by reinforcement fine-tuning with joint rewards evaluating both segmentation accuracy and reasoning quality alignment. Experiments on two video (JiTBench, RVTBench) and two image benchmarks (ReasonSeg, LLM-Seg40K) demonstrate that our FastReasonSeg achieves state-of-the-art reasoning segmentation performance. Moreover, the distilled 0.6B variant outperforms models with 20 times more parameters while achieving 7.79 FPS throughput with only 2.1GB memory consumption. This efficiency enables deployment in resource-constrained environments to enable real-time reasoning segmentation.

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了姿态无关、无需标签、多视角一致的在线场景变化检测，在保持实时性的同时超越了离线方法的精度

Abstract: Online Scene Change Detection (SCD) is an extremely challenging problem that requires an agent to detect relevant changes on the fly while observing the scene from unconstrained viewpoints. Existing online SCD methods are significantly less accurate than offline approaches. We present the first online SCD approach that is pose-agnostic, label-free, and ensures multi-view consistency, while operating at over 10 FPS and achieving new state-of-the-art performance, surpassing even the best offline approaches. Our method introduces a new self-supervised fusion loss to infer scene changes from multiple cues and observations, PnP-based fast pose estimation against the reference scene, and a fast change-guided update strategy for the 3D Gaussian Splatting scene representation. Extensive experiments on complex real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms both online and offline baselines.

Conclusion: 该方法成功扩展了文本到视频检索的能力边界，为处理复杂推理查询提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The goal of text-to-video retrieval is to search large databases for relevant videos based on text queries. Existing methods have progressed to handling explicit queries where the visual content of interest is described explicitly; however, they fail with implicit queries where identifying videos relevant to the query requires reasoning. We introduce reasoning text-to-video retrieval, a paradigm that extends traditional retrieval to process implicit queries through reasoning while providing object-level grounding masks that identify which entities satisfy the query conditions. Instead of relying on vision-language models directly, we propose representing video content as digital twins, i.e., structured scene representations that decompose salient objects through specialist vision models. This approach is beneficial because it enables large language models to reason directly over long-horizon video content without visual token compression. Specifically, our two-stage framework first performs compositional alignment between decomposed sub-queries and digital twin representations for candidate identification, then applies large language model-based reasoning with just-in-time refinement that invokes additional specialist models to address information gaps. We construct a benchmark of 447 manually created implicit queries with 135 videos (ReasonT2VBench-135) and another more challenging version of 1000 videos (ReasonT2VBench-1000). Our method achieves 81.2% R@1 on ReasonT2VBench-135, outperforming the strongest baseline by greater than 50 percentage points, and maintains 81.7% R@1 on the extended configuration while establishing state-of-the-art results in three conventional benchmarks (MSR-VTT, MSVD, and VATEX).

Conclusion: AGGRNet能有效改善复杂医学图像分类任务，特别是在区分细微类别方面表现优异。

Abstract: Medical image analysis for complex tasks such as severity grading and disease subtype classification poses significant challenges due to intricate and similar visual patterns among classes, scarcity of labeled data, and variability in expert interpretations. Despite the usefulness of existing attention-based models in capturing complex visual patterns for medical image classification, underlying architectures often face challenges in effectively distinguishing subtle classes since they struggle to capture inter-class similarity and intra-class variability, resulting in incorrect diagnosis. To address this, we propose AGGRNet framework to extract informative and non-informative features to effectively understand fine-grained visual patterns and improve classification for complex medical image analysis tasks. Experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on various medical imaging datasets, with the best improvement up to 5% over SOTA models on the Kvasir dataset.

Abstract: The objective of this study is to diagnose and differentiate kidney stones, cysts, and tumors using Computed Tomography (CT) images of the kidney. This study leverages a hybrid quantum-classical framework in this regard. We combine a pretrained ResNet50 encoder, with a Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) to explore quantum-assisted diagnosis. We pre-process the kidney images using denoising and contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization to enhance feature extraction. We address class imbalance through data augmentation and weighted sampling. Latent features extracted by the encoder are transformed into qubits via angle encoding and processed by a QCNN. The model is evaluated on both 8-qubit and 12-qubit configurations. Both architectures achieved rapid convergence with stable learning curves and high consistency between training and validation performance. The models reached a test accuracy of 0.99, with the 12-qubit configuration providing improvements in overall recall and precision, particularly for Cyst and Tumor detection, where it achieved perfect recall for Cysts and a tumor F1-score of 0.9956. Confusion matrix analysis further confirmed reliable classification behavior across all classes, with very few misclassifications. Results demonstrate that integrating classical pre-processing and deep feature extraction with quantum circuits enhances medical diagnostic performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Uncertainty-Guided Inference-Time Selection框架，在深度特征空间中解耦偶然不确定性和认知不确定性，无需采样、集成或额外前向传播，通过不确定性指导的自适应模型选择可减少约60%计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数估计器将所有不确定性模式压缩为单一置信度分数，无法可靠地判断何时需要分配更多计算资源或调整推理过程。

Method: 使用正则化全局密度模型估计偶然不确定性，认知不确定性由三个互补组件构成：局部支持不足、流形谱崩溃和跨层特征不一致性，这些组件经验正交且无需额外计算。

Result: 在MOT17数据集上减少约60%计算量且精度损失可忽略，不确定性分解比总不确定性基线提高13.6个百分点的计算节省。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了实用的自调节视觉推理，通过解耦的不确定性指导自适应模型选择，显著提升计算效率。

Abstract: Most estimators collapse all uncertainty modes into a single confidence score, preventing reliable reasoning about when to allocate more compute or adjust inference. We introduce Uncertainty-Guided Inference-Time Selection, a lightweight inference time framework that disentangles aleatoric (data-driven) and epistemic (model-driven) uncertainty directly in deep feature space. Aleatoric uncertainty is estimated using a regularized global density model, while epistemic uncertainty is formed from three complementary components that capture local support deficiency, manifold spectral collapse, and cross-layer feature inconsistency. These components are empirically orthogonal and require no sampling, no ensembling, and no additional forward passes. We integrate the decomposed uncertainty into a distribution free conformal calibration procedure that yields significantly tighter prediction intervals at matched coverage. Using these components for uncertainty guided adaptive model selection reduces compute by approximately 60 percent on MOT17 with negligible accuracy loss, enabling practical self regulating visual inference. Additionally, our ablation results show that the proposed orthogonal uncertainty decomposition consistently yields higher computational savings across all MOT17 sequences, improving margins by 13.6 percentage points over the total-uncertainty baseline.

*Xu Yang,Gady Agam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSLoRA是一种与骨干网络无关的参数高效适配器，通过重新加权特征响应而不是重新调整骨干网络来实现迁移学习，统一支持CNN和ViT架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的低秩适应方法主要局限于视觉变换器（ViT），难以跨架构泛化，需要一种统一支持CNN和ViT的高效适配方法。

Method: 结合低秩线性投影和多尺度非线性变换，通过点乘和残差连接融合，联合调制空间和通道注意力，保持预训练权重冻结。

Result: 在分类、检测和分割任务上持续提升迁移性能，仅需骨干网络约5%的参数，实现稳定优化、快速收敛和强跨架构泛化能力。

Conclusion: MSLoRA通过重新加权而非重新调整，为冻结视觉骨干网络的高效适应提供了一种简单通用的方法。

Abstract: We introduce MSLoRA, a backbone-agnostic, parameter-efficient adapter that reweights feature responses rather
  than re-tuning the underlying backbone. Existing low-rank adaptation methods are mostly confined to vision
  transformers (ViTs) and struggle to generalize across architectures. MSLoRA unifies adaptation for both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
  ViTs by combining a low-rank linear projection with a multi-scale nonlinear transformation that jointly
  modulates spatial and channel attention. The two components are fused through pointwise multiplication and
  a residual connection, yielding a lightweight module that shifts feature attention while keeping pretrained
  weights frozen.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that MSLoRA consistently improves transfer performance on classification,
  detection, and segmentation tasks with roughly less than 5\% of backbone parameters.
  The design further enables stable optimization, fast convergence, and strong cross-architecture
  generalization. By reweighting rather than re-tuning, MSLoRA provides a simple and universal approach
  for efficient adaptation of frozen vision backbones.

Conclusion: VLA-R框架成功地将开放世界感知与视觉-动作检索相结合，为端到端自动驾驶提供了有效的开放世界推理和动作检索能力。

Abstract: Exploring open-world situations in an end-to-end manner is a promising yet challenging task due to the need for strong generalization capabilities. In particular, end-to-end autonomous driving in unstructured outdoor environments often encounters conditions that were unfamiliar during training. In this work, we present Vision-Language Action Retrieval (VLA-R), an open-world end-to-end autonomous driving (OW-E2EAD) framework that integrates open-world perception with a novel vision-action retrieval paradigm. We leverage a frozen vision-language model for open-world detection and segmentation to obtain multi-scale, prompt-guided, and interpretable perception features without domain-specific tuning. A Q-Former bottleneck aggregates fine-grained visual representations with language-aligned visual features, bridging perception and action domains. To learn transferable driving behaviors, we introduce a vision-action contrastive learning scheme that aligns vision-language and action embeddings for effective open-world reasoning and action retrieval. Our experiments on a real-world robotic platform demonstrate strong generalization and exploratory performance in unstructured, unseen environments, even with limited data. Demo videos are provided in the supplementary material.

Conclusion: 自监督提示是构建可扩展和自适应视觉检测系统的实用方向。

Abstract: The deployment of automated pavement defect detection is often hindered by poor cross-domain generalization. Supervised detectors achieve strong in-domain accuracy but require costly re-annotation for new environments, while standard self-supervised methods capture generic features and remain vulnerable to domain shift. We propose \ours, a self-supervised framework that \emph{visually probes} target domains without labels. \ours introduces a Self-supervised Prompt Enhancement Module (SPEM), which derives defect-aware prompts from unlabeled target data to guide a frozen ViT backbone, and a Domain-Aware Prompt Alignment (DAPA) objective, which aligns prompt-conditioned source and target representations. Experiments on four challenging benchmarks show that \ours consistently outperforms strong supervised, self-supervised, and adaptation baselines, achieving robust zero-shot transfer, improved resilience to domain variations, and high data efficiency in few-shot adaptation. These results highlight self-supervised prompting as a practical direction for building scalable and adaptive visual inspection systems.

Method: 提出基于重投影误差的纯旋转优化框架，适用于双视图和多视图场景，在旋转流形上进行优化。

Result: 实验结果显示该方法在旋转估计精度和鲁棒性方面优于当前最先进方法，甚至可与多次捆绑调整迭代结果相媲美。

Conclusion: 这项工作有望为更准确、高效和可靠的3D视觉计算做出贡献。

Abstract: Structure from Motion (SfM) is a critical task in computer vision, aiming to recover the 3D scene structure and camera motion from a sequence of 2D images. The recent pose-only imaging geometry decouples 3D coordinates from camera poses and demonstrates significantly better SfM performance through pose adjustment. Continuing the pose-only perspective, this paper explores the critical relationship between the scene structures, rotation and translation. Notably, the translation can be expressed in terms of rotation, allowing us to condense the imaging geometry representation onto the rotation manifold. A rotation-only optimization framework based on reprojection error is proposed for both two-view and multi-view scenarios. The experiment results demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness performance over the current state-of-the-art rotation estimation methods, even comparable to multiple bundle adjustment iteration results. Hopefully, this work contributes to even more accurate, efficient and reliable 3D visual computing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实世界图像常受恶劣天气影响而退化，现有的天气恢复方法可能会牺牲对分析小物体至关重要的高频细节。简单的去雨和超分辨率级联方法在处理高频内容时存在冲突。

Method: 提出DHGM模型，整合预训练扩散先验与高通滤波器，同时进行雨滴去除和结构细节增强，避免传统级联方法中的内容不一致问题。

Result: 大量实验表明，DHGM在性能上优于现有方法，且具有更低的计算成本。

Conclusion: DHGM能够有效生成干净且高分辨率的图像，成功解决了天气恢复和超分辨率之间的内在冲突。

Abstract: Clean images are crucial for visual tasks such as small object detection, especially at high resolutions. However, real-world images are often degraded by adverse weather, and weather restoration methods may sacrifice high-frequency details critical for analyzing small objects. A natural solution is to apply super-resolution (SR) after weather removal to recover both clarity and fine structures. However, simply cascading restoration and SR struggle to bridge their inherent conflict: removal aims to remove high-frequency weather-induced noise, while SR aims to hallucinate high-frequency textures from existing details, leading to inconsistent restoration contents. In this paper, we take deraining as a case study and propose DHGM, a Diffusion-based High-frequency Guided Model for generating clean and high-resolution images. DHGM integrates pre-trained diffusion priors with high-pass filters to simultaneously remove rain artifacts and enhance structural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DHGM achieves superior performance over existing methods, with lower costs.

TL;DR: MFI-ResNet通过压缩-扩展策略，使用MeanFlow模块替代ResNet中的多层结构，在减少45%以上参数的同时提升分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受流匹配模型MeanFlow的启发，探索生成式流场如何有效表征ResNet中的特征变换过程，为理解生成式建模与判别式学习的关系提供新视角。

Method: 采用压缩-扩展策略：压缩阶段将每个ResNet阶段简化为1-2个MeanFlow模块构建轻量元模型；扩展阶段对前三个阶段采用选择性孵化策略，扩展到与基线ResNet相同的残差块配置，最后一个阶段保持MeanFlow形式，然后微调孵化模型。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上，相比ResNet-50，MFI-ResNet分别减少46.28%和45.59%的参数，同时准确率分别提升0.23%和0.17%。

Conclusion: 生成式流场可以有效表征ResNet中的特征变换过程，为理解生成式建模与判别式学习的关系提供了新视角，实现了参数效率和判别性能的联合提升。

Abstract: ResNet has achieved tremendous success in computer vision through its residual connection mechanism. ResNet can be viewed as a discretized form of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). From this perspective, the multiple residual blocks within a single ResNet stage essentially perform multi-step discrete iterations of the feature transformation for that stage. The recently proposed flow matching model, MeanFlow, enables one-step generative modeling by learning the mean velocity field to transform distributions. Inspired by this, we propose MeanFlow-Incubated ResNet (MFI-ResNet), which employs a compression-expansion strategy to jointly improve parameter efficiency and discriminative performance. In the compression phase, we simplify the multi-layer structure within each ResNet stage to one or two MeanFlow modules to construct a lightweight meta model. In the expansion phase, we apply a selective incubation strategy to the first three stages, expanding them to match the residual block configuration of the baseline ResNet model, while keeping the last stage in MeanFlow form, and fine-tune the incubated model. Experimental results show that on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, MFI-ResNet achieves remarkable parameter efficiency, reducing parameters by 46.28% and 45.59% compared to ResNet-50, while still improving accuracy by 0.23% and 0.17%, respectively. This demonstrates that generative flow-fields can effectively characterize the feature transformation process in ResNet, providing a new perspective for understanding the relationship between generative modeling and discriminative learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RedVTP是一种针对扩散视觉语言模型(DVLMs)的响应驱动视觉token剪枝策略，通过利用掩码响应token的注意力来估计视觉token重要性，在保持准确性的同时显著提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散视觉语言模型虽然支持并行token解码，但大量视觉token严重阻碍了推理效率。虽然视觉token剪枝在自回归VLMs中已有研究，但在DVLMs中仍未被充分探索。

Method: 提出RedVTP策略，利用掩码响应token的注意力估计视觉token重要性，基于重要性分数在推理步骤间保持一致的观察，在第一步推理后剪枝不重要的视觉token。

Result: 实验显示RedVTP将LLaDA-V和LaViDa的token生成吞吐量分别提升186%和28.05%，推理延迟分别降低64.97%和21.87%，且不损害甚至在某些情况下提高了准确性。

Conclusion: RedVTP有效解决了DVLMs的推理效率问题，通过响应驱动的视觉token剪枝实现了显著的性能提升，为高效多模态推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal reasoning and generation, yet their high computational demands remain a major challenge. Diffusion Vision-Language Models (DVLMs) are particularly attractive because they enable parallel token decoding, but the large number of visual tokens still significantly hinders their inference efficiency. While visual token pruning has been extensively studied for autoregressive VLMs (AVLMs), it remains largely unexplored for DVLMs. In this work, we propose RedVTP, a response-driven visual token pruning strategy that leverages the inference dynamics of DVLMs. Our method estimates visual token importance using attention from the masked response tokens. Based on the observation that these importance scores remain consistent across steps, RedVTP prunes the less important visual tokens from the masked tokens after the first inference step, thereby maximizing inference efficiency. Experiments show that RedVTP improves token generation throughput of LLaDA-V and LaViDa by up to 186% and 28.05%, respectively, and reduces inference latency by up to 64.97% and 21.87%, without compromising-and in some cases improving-accuracy.

Conclusion: UP-Fusion框架通过通道扰动和预训练知识集成，有效解决了多模态图像融合中的模态差异问题，在保持泛化能力的同时提升了融合性能。

Abstract: Multi-modality image fusion enhances scene perception by combining complementary information. Unified models aim to share parameters across modalities for multi-modality image fusion, but large modality differences often cause gradient conflicts, limiting performance. Some methods introduce modality-specific encoders to enhance feature perception and improve fusion quality. However, this strategy reduces generalisation across different fusion tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose a unified multi-modality image fusion framework based on channel perturbation and pre-trained knowledge integration (UP-Fusion). To suppress redundant modal information and emphasize key features, we propose the Semantic-Aware Channel Pruning Module (SCPM), which leverages the semantic perception capability of a pre-trained model to filter and enhance multi-modality feature channels. Furthermore, we proposed the Geometric Affine Modulation Module (GAM), which uses original modal features to apply affine transformations on initial fusion features to maintain the feature encoder modal discriminability. Finally, we apply a Text-Guided Channel Perturbation Module (TCPM) during decoding to reshape the channel distribution, reducing the dependence on modality-specific channels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing methods on both multi-modality image fusion and downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 该系统提供了一种非侵入式、低成本且有效的疲劳检测方法，能够实时预警，有望拯救道路上的无辜生命

Abstract: A long road trip is fun for drivers. However, a long drive for days can be tedious for a driver to accommodate stringent deadlines to reach distant destinations. Such a scenario forces drivers to drive extra miles, utilizing extra hours daily without sufficient rest and breaks. Once a driver undergoes such a scenario, it occasionally triggers drowsiness during driving. Drowsiness in driving can be life-threatening to any individual and can affect other drivers' safety; therefore, a real-time detection system is needed. To identify fatigued facial characteristics in drivers and trigger the alarm immediately, this research develops a real-time driver drowsiness detection system utilizing deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and OpenCV.Our proposed and implemented model takes real- time facial images of a driver using a live camera and utilizes a Python-based library named OpenCV to examine the facial images for facial landmarks like sufficient eye openings and yawn-like mouth movements. The DCNNs framework then gathers the data and utilizes a per-trained model to detect the drowsiness of a driver using facial landmarks. If the driver is identified as drowsy, the system issues a continuous alert in real time, embedded in the Smart Car technology.By potentially saving innocent lives on the roadways, the proposed technique offers a non-invasive, inexpensive, and cost-effective way to identify drowsiness. Our proposed and implemented DCNNs embedded drowsiness detection model successfully react with NTHU-DDD dataset and Yawn-Eye-Dataset with drowsiness detection classification accuracy of 99.6% and 97% respectively.

Conclusion: CoTBox-TTT是一种无需标签、即插即用的测试时训练方法，能有效提高医学视觉问答系统在领域偏移下的可靠性和准确性。

Abstract: Medical visual question answering could support clinical decision making, yet current systems often fail under domain shift and produce answers that are weakly grounded in image evidence. This reliability gap arises when models attend to spurious regions and when retraining or additional labels are impractical at deployment time. We address this setting with CoTBox-TTT, an evidence-first test-time training approach that adapts a vision-language model at inference while keeping all backbones frozen. The method updates only a small set of continuous soft prompts. It identifies question-relevant regions through a visual chain-of-thought signal and encourages answer consistency across the original image and a localized crop. The procedure is label free, and plug and play with diverse backbones. Experiments on medical VQA show that the approach is practical for real deployments. For instance, adding CoTBox-TTT to LLaVA increases closed-ended accuracy by 12.3% on pathVQA.

Conclusion: MOON2.0通过动态模态平衡框架有效解决了电商产品理解中的关键挑战，在多模态表示学习方面表现出色。

Abstract: The rapid growth of e-commerce calls for multimodal models that comprehend rich visual and textual product information. Although recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for product understanding exhibit strong capability in representation learning for e-commerce, they still face three challenges: (i) the modality imbalance induced by modality mixed training; (ii) underutilization of the intrinsic alignment relationships among visual and textual information within a product; and (iii) limited handling of noise in e-commerce multimodal data. To address these, we propose MOON2.0, a dynamic modality-balanced multimodal representation learning framework for e-commerce product understanding. MOON2.0 comprises: (1) a Modality-driven Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module that adaptively processes input samples by their modality composition, enabling Multimodal Joint Learning to mitigate the modality imbalance; (2) a Dual-level Alignment method to better leverage semantic alignment properties inside individual products; and (3) an MLLM-based Image-text Co-augmentation strategy that integrates textual enrichment with visual expansion, coupled with Dynamic Sample Filtering to improve training data quality. We further introduce MBE2.0, a co-augmented multimodal representation benchmark for e-commerce representation learning and evaluation. Experiments show that MOON2.0 delivers state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on MBE2.0 and multiple public datasets. Furthermore, attention-based heatmap visualization provides qualitative evidence of improved multimodal alignment of MOON2.0.

TL;DR: 提出MaskAnyNet方法，将图像掩码区域作为辅助知识而非丢弃信息，通过重新学习机制同时利用可见和掩码区域来增强特征表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像掩码方法存在两个问题：丢弃像素未充分利用导致上下文信息损失；掩码可能移除细小或关键特征。MIM表明掩码区域可以从部分输入重建，揭示不完整数据与原始图像具有强上下文一致性，掩码区域具有语义多样性潜力。

Method: 提出MaskAnyNet，结合掩码和重新学习机制，通过额外分支从重新组合的掩码区域联合学习，利用掩码区域的语义多样性来丰富特征并保留细粒度细节。

Result: 在CNN和Transformer骨干网络上的实验显示，在多个基准测试中均获得一致性能提升。

Conclusion: 所提方法通过重用掩码内容提高了语义多样性，证明了掩码区域作为辅助知识的有效性。

Abstract: In supervised learning, traditional image masking faces two key issues: (i) discarded pixels are underutilized, leading to a loss of valuable contextual information; (ii) masking may remove small or critical features, especially in fine-grained tasks. In contrast, masked image modeling (MIM) has demonstrated that masked regions can be reconstructed from partial input, revealing that even incomplete data can exhibit strong contextual consistency with the original image. This highlights the potential of masked regions as sources of semantic diversity. Motivated by this, we revisit the image masking approach, proposing to treat masked content as auxiliary knowledge rather than ignored. Based on this, we propose MaskAnyNet, which combines masking with a relearning mechanism to exploit both visible and masked information. It can be easily extended to any model with an additional branch to jointly learn from the recomposed masked region. This approach leverages the semantic diversity of the masked regions to enrich features and preserve fine-grained details. Experiments on CNN and Transformer backbones show consistent gains across multiple benchmarks. Further analysis confirms that the proposed method improves semantic diversity through the reuse of masked content.

Abstract: Recent camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) methods have increasingly explored leveraging temporal cues to enrich the features of the current frame. However, while these approaches primarily focus on enhancing in-frame regions, they often struggle to reconstruct critical out-of-frame areas near the sides of the ego-vehicle, although previous frames commonly contain valuable contextual information about these unseen regions. To address this limitation, we propose the Current-Centric Contextual 3D Fusion (C3DFusion) module, which generates hidden region-aware 3D feature geometry by explicitly aligning 3D-lifted point features from both current and historical frames. C3DFusion performs enhanced temporal fusion through two complementary techniques-historical context blurring and current-centric feature densification-which suppress noise from inaccurately warped historical point features by attenuating their scale, and enhance current point features by increasing their volumetric contribution. Simply integrated into standard SSC architectures, C3DFusion demonstrates strong effectiveness, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 datasets. Furthermore, it exhibits robust generalization, achieving notable performance gains when applied to other baseline models.

Conclusion: 提出的可见结构检索网络为基于结构的重定位提供了一种更高效的新范式。

Abstract: Accurate camera pose estimation from an image observation in a previously mapped environment is commonly done through structure-based methods: by finding correspondences between 2D keypoints on the image and 3D structure points in the map. In order to make this correspondence search tractable in large scenes, existing pipelines either rely on search heuristics, or perform image retrieval to reduce the search space by comparing the current image to a database of past observations. However, these approaches result in elaborate pipelines or storage requirements that grow with the number of past observations. In this work, we propose a new paradigm for making structure-based relocalisation tractable. Instead of relying on image retrieval or search heuristics, we learn a direct mapping from image observations to the visible scene structure in a compact neural network. Given a query image, a forward pass through our novel visible structure retrieval network allows obtaining the subset of 3D structure points in the map that the image views, thus reducing the search space of 2D-3D correspondences. We show that our proposed method enables performing localisation with an accuracy comparable to the state of the art, while requiring lower computational and storage footprint.

Abstract: With growing concerns over image authenticity and digital safety, the field of AI-generated image (AIGI) detection has progressed rapidly. Yet, most AIGI detectors still struggle under real-world degradations, particularly motion blur, which frequently occurs in handheld photography, fast motion, and compressed video. Such blur distorts fine textures and suppresses high-frequency artifacts, causing severe performance drops in real-world settings. We address this limitation with a blur-robust AIGI detection framework based on teacher-student knowledge distillation. A high-capacity teacher (DINOv3), trained on clean (i.e., sharp) images, provides stable and semantically rich representations that serve as a reference for learning. By freezing the teacher to maintain its generalization ability, we distill its feature and logit responses from sharp images to a student trained on blurred counterparts, enabling the student to produce consistent representations under motion degradation. Extensive experiments benchmarks show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under both motion-blurred and clean conditions, demonstrating improved generalization and real-world applicability.

Conclusion: 提出的MdaIF框架能够有效处理多退化场景下的图像融合问题，通过退化感知机制和自适应网络架构实现了鲁棒的融合性能。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion aims to integrate complementary multi-modal information into a single fused result. However, existing methods 1) fail to account for the degradation visible images under adverse weather conditions, thereby compromising fusion performance; and 2) rely on fixed network architectures, limiting their adaptability to diverse degradation scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a one-stop degradation-aware image fusion framework for multi-degradation scenarios driven by a large language model (MdaIF). Given the distinct scattering characteristics of different degradation scenarios (e.g., haze, rain, and snow) in atmospheric transmission, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) system is introduced to tackle image fusion across multiple degradation scenarios. To adaptively extract diverse weather-aware degradation knowledge and scene feature representations, collectively referred to as the semantic prior, we employ a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) in our framework. Guided by the semantic prior, we propose degradation-aware channel attention module (DCAM), which employ degradation prototype decomposition to facilitate multi-modal feature interaction in channel domain. In addition, to achieve effective expert routing, the semantic prior and channel-domain modulated features are utilized to guide the MoE, enabling robust image fusion in complex degradation scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our MdaIF, demonstrating superior performance over SOTA methods.

Conclusion: D²-VPR框架在视觉位置识别任务中实现了更好的性能-效率权衡，为资源受限环境下的部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) aims to determine the geographic location of a query image by retrieving its most visually similar counterpart from a geo-tagged reference database. Recently, the emergence of the powerful visual foundation model, DINOv2, trained in a self-supervised manner on massive datasets, has significantly improved VPR performance. This improvement stems from DINOv2's exceptional feature generalization capabilities but is often accompanied by increased model complexity and computational overhead that impede deployment on resource-constrained devices. To address this challenge, we propose $D^{2}$-VPR, a $D$istillation- and $D$eformable-based framework that retains the strong feature extraction capabilities of visual foundation models while significantly reducing model parameters and achieving a more favorable performance-efficiency trade-off. Specifically, first, we employ a two-stage training strategy that integrates knowledge distillation and fine-tuning. Additionally, we introduce a Distillation Recovery Module (DRM) to better align the feature spaces between the teacher and student models, thereby minimizing knowledge transfer losses to the greatest extent possible. Second, we design a Top-Down-attention-based Deformable Aggregator (TDDA) that leverages global semantic features to dynamically and adaptively adjust the Regions of Interest (ROI) used for aggregation, thereby improving adaptability to irregular structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Meanwhile, it reduces the parameter count by approximately 64.2% and FLOPs by about 62.6% (compared to CricaVPR).Code is available at https://github.com/tony19980810/D2VPR.

Motivation: 由于视觉语言模型的输入token有限以及视频帧中相关信息的时间稀疏性，关键帧选择对视频理解至关重要。需要选择既信息丰富又具有因果决定性的关键帧。

Method: 提出ReaSon框架，将关键帧选择建模为优化问题：1）使用可学习策略网络从视觉相关候选帧中选择关键帧确保预测充分性；2）通过反事实干预评估因果必要性；3）设计符合CIB原则的复合奖励，通过强化学习指导选择策略。

Conclusion: ReaSon通过因果信息瓶颈框架有效解决了视频理解中的关键帧选择问题，在保持预测性能的同时确保所选关键帧的因果必要性。

Abstract: Keyframe selection has become essential for video understanding with vision-language models (VLMs) due to limited input tokens and the temporal sparsity of relevant information across video frames. Video understanding often relies on effective keyframes that are not only informative but also causally decisive. To this end, we propose Reinforced Causal Search with Information Bottleneck (ReaSon), a framework that formulates keyframe selection as an optimization problem with the help of a novel Causal Information Bottleneck (CIB), which explicitly defines keyframes as those satisfying both predictive sufficiency and causal necessity. Specifically, ReaSon employs a learnable policy network to select keyframes from a visually relevant pool of candidate frames to capture predictive sufficiency, and then assesses causal necessity via counterfactual interventions. Finally, a composite reward aligned with the CIB principle is designed to guide the selection policy through reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments on NExT-QA, EgoSchema, and Video-MME demonstrate that ReaSon consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods under limited-frame settings, validating its effectiveness and generalization ability.

Conclusion: HiGFA通过分层、置信度驱动的协调机制，能够生成多样化且忠实的合成图像，在全局结构形成和精确细节细化之间实现智能平衡。

Abstract: Generative diffusion models show promise for data augmentation. However, applying them to fine-grained tasks presents a significant challenge: ensuring synthetic images accurately capture the subtle, category-defining features critical for high fidelity. Standard approaches, such as text-based Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), often lack the required specificity, potentially generating misleading examples that degrade fine-grained classifier performance. To address this, we propose Hierarchically Guided Fine-grained Augmentation (HiGFA). HiGFA leverages the temporal dynamics of the diffusion sampling process. It employs strong text and transformed contour guidance with fixed strengths in the early-to-mid sampling stages to establish overall scene, style, and structure. In the final sampling stages, HiGFA activates a specialized fine-grained classifier guidance and dynamically modulates the strength of all guidance signals based on prediction confidence. This hierarchical, confidence-driven orchestration enables HiGFA to generate diverse yet faithful synthetic images by intelligently balancing global structure formation with precise detail refinement. Experiments on several FGVC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HiGFA.

Abstract: Visual Emotion Analysis (VEA) aims to bridge the affective gap between visual content and human emotional responses. Despite its promise, progress in this field remains limited by the lack of open-source and interpretable datasets. Most existing studies assign a single discrete emotion label to an entire image, offering limited insight into how visual elements contribute to emotion. In this work, we introduce EmoVerse, a large-scale open-source dataset that enables interpretable visual emotion analysis through multi-layered, knowledge-graph-inspired annotations. By decomposing emotions into Background-Attribute-Subject (B-A-S) triplets and grounding each element to visual regions, EmoVerse provides word-level and subject-level emotional reasoning. With over 219k images, the dataset further includes dual annotations in Categorical Emotion States (CES) and Dimensional Emotion Space (DES), facilitating unified discrete and continuous emotion representation. A novel multi-stage pipeline ensures high annotation reliability with minimal human effort. Finally, we introduce an interpretable model that maps visual cues into DES representations and provides detailed attribution explanations. Together, the dataset, pipeline, and model form a comprehensive foundation for advancing explainable high-level emotion understanding.

Abstract: Ultrasound standard plane recognition is essential for clinical tasks such as disease screening, organ evaluation, and biometric measurement. However, existing methods fail to effectively exploit shallow structural information and struggle to capture fine-grained semantic differences through contrastive samples generated by image augmentations, ultimately resulting in suboptimal recognition of both structural and discriminative details in ultrasound standard planes. To address these issues, we propose SEMC, a novel Structure-Enhanced Mixture-of-Experts Contrastive learning framework that combines structure-aware feature fusion with expert-guided contrastive learning. Specifically, we first introduce a novel Semantic-Structure Fusion Module (SSFM) to exploit multi-scale structural information and enhance the model's ability to perceive fine-grained structural details by effectively aligning shallow and deep features. Then, a novel Mixture-of-Experts Contrastive Recognition Module (MCRM) is designed to perform hierarchical contrastive learning and classification across multi-level features using a mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanism, further improving class separability and recognition performance. More importantly, we also curate a large-scale and meticulously annotated liver ultrasound dataset containing six standard planes. Extensive experimental results on our in-house dataset and two public datasets demonstrate that SEMC outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods across various metrics.

Abstract: Precise modeling of lane topology is essential for autonomous driving, as it directly impacts navigation and control decisions.Existing methods typically represent each lane with a single query and infer topological connectivity based on the similarity between lane queries.However, this kind of design struggles to accurately model complex lane structures, leading to unreliable topology prediction.In this view, we propose a Fine-Grained lane topology reasoning framework (TopoFG).It divides the procedure from bird's-eye-view (BEV) features to topology prediction via fine-grained queries into three phases, i.e., Hierarchical Prior Extractor (HPE), Region-Focused Decoder (RFD), and Robust Boundary-Point Topology Reasoning (RBTR).Specifically, HPE extracts global spatial priors from the BEV mask and local sequential priors from in-lane keypoint sequences to guide subsequent fine-grained query modeling.RFD constructs fine-grained queries by integrating the spatial and sequential priors. It then samples reference points in RoI regions of the mask and applies cross-attention with BEV features to refine the query representations of each lane.RBTR models lane connectivity based on boundary-point query features and further employs a topological denoising strategy to reduce matching ambiguity.By integrating spatial and sequential priors into fine-grained queries and applying a denoising strategy to boundary-point topology reasoning, our method precisely models complex lane structures and delivers trustworthy topology predictions.Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate that TopoFG achieves new state-of-the-art performance, with an OLS of 48.0% on subsetA and 45.4% on subsetB.

Motivation: 目标是实现完全自动化的空中野火监测，使用自主无人机在烟雾或火焰可见之前早期检测地面火灾。合成孔径感知虽然减轻了树冠和阳光的遮挡，但引入了热模糊，掩盖了实际地表温度。

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for reconstructing surface temperatures through occluding forest vegetation by combining signal processing and machine learning. Our goal is to enable fully automated aerial wildfire monitoring using autonomous drones, allowing for the early detection of ground fires before smoke or flames are visible. While synthetic aperture (SA) sensing mitigates occlusion from the canopy and sunlight, it introduces thermal blur that obscures the actual surface temperatures. To address this, we train a visual state space model to recover the subtle thermal signals of partially occluded soil and fire hotspots from this blurred data. A key challenge was the scarcity of real-world training data. We overcome this by integrating a latent diffusion model into a vector quantized to generated a large volume of realistic surface temperature simulations from real wildfire recordings, which we further expanded through temperature augmentation and procedural thermal forest simulation. On simulated data across varied ambient and surface temperatures, forest densities, and sunlight conditions, our method reduced the RMSE by a factor of 2 to 2.5 compared to conventional thermal and uncorrected SA imaging. In field experiments focused on high-temperature hotspots, the improvement was even more significant, with a 12.8-fold RMSE gain over conventional thermal and a 2.6-fold gain over uncorrected SA images. We also demonstrate our model's generalization to other thermal signals, such as human signatures for search and rescue. Since simple thresholding is frequently inadequate for detecting subtle thermal signals, the morphological characteristics are equally essential for accurate classification. Our experiments demonstrated another clear advantage: we reconstructed the complete morphology of fire and human signatures, whereas conventional imaging is defeated by partial occlusion.

Result: 在三个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著降低了五个最先进商业LVLM的地理位置预测准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法为对抗新兴地理隐私威胁提供了一种实用且视觉保持的保护策略。

Abstract: Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) now pose a serious yet overlooked privacy threat, as they can infer a social media user's geolocation directly from shared images, leading to unintended privacy leakage. While adversarial image perturbations provide a potential direction for geo-privacy protection, they require relatively strong distortions to be effective against LVLMs, which noticeably degrade visual quality and diminish an image's value for sharing. To overcome this limitation, we identify typographical attacks as a promising direction for protecting geo-privacy by adding text extension outside the visual content. We further investigate which textual semantics are effective in disrupting geolocation inference and design a two-stage, semantics-aware typographical attack that generates deceptive text to protect user privacy. Extensive experiments across three datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces geolocation prediction accuracy of five state-of-the-art commercial LVLMs, establishing a practical and visually-preserving protection strategy against emerging geo-privacy threats.

Abstract: We introduce a unified, end-to-end framework that seamlessly integrates object detection and pose estimation with a versatile onboarding process. Our pipeline begins with an onboarding stage that generates object representations from either traditional 3D CAD models or, in their absence, by rapidly reconstructing a high-fidelity neural representation (NeRF) from multi-view images. Given a test image, our system first employs the CNOS detector to localize target objects. For each detection, our novel pose estimation module, OPFormer, infers the precise 6D pose. The core of OPFormer is a transformer-based architecture that leverages a foundation model for robust feature extraction. It uniquely learns a comprehensive object representation by jointly encoding multiple template views and enriches these features with explicit 3D geometric priors using Normalized Object Coordinate Space (NOCS). A decoder then establishes robust 2D-3D correspondences to determine the final pose. Evaluated on the challenging BOP benchmarks, our integrated system demonstrates a strong balance between accuracy and efficiency, showcasing its practical applicability in both model-based and model-free scenarios.

Conclusion: CountIHC框架有效解决了IHC图像中的多类细胞计数问题，为癌症诊断提供了可靠的工具，并展示了在相关任务中的广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate cell counting in immunohistochemistry (IHC) images is critical for quantifying protein expression and aiding cancer diagnosis. However, the task remains challenging due to the chromogen overlap, variable biomarker staining, and diverse cellular morphologies. Regression-based counting methods offer advantages over detection-based ones in handling overlapped cells, yet rarely support end-to-end multi-class counting. Moreover, the potential of foundation models remains largely underexplored in this paradigm. To address these limitations, we propose a rank-aware agglomeration framework that selectively distills knowledge from multiple strong foundation models, leveraging their complementary representations to handle IHC heterogeneity and obtain a compact yet effective student model, CountIHC. Unlike prior task-agnostic agglomeration strategies that either treat all teachers equally or rely on feature similarity, we design a Rank-Aware Teacher Selecting (RATS) strategy that models global-to-local patch rankings to assess each teacher's inherent counting capacity and enable sample-wise teacher selection. For multi-class cell counting, we introduce a fine-tuning stage that reformulates the task as vision-language alignment. Discrete semantic anchors derived from structured text prompts encode both category and quantity information, guiding the regression of class-specific density maps and improving counting for overlapping cells. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CountIHC surpasses state-of-the-art methods across 12 IHC biomarkers and 5 tissue types, while exhibiting high agreement with pathologists' assessments. Its effectiveness on H&E-stained data further confirms the scalability of the proposed method.

TL;DR: C3Net是一个用于伪装目标检测的双路径解码器架构，通过边缘细化路径和上下文定位路径协同工作，解决了伪装目标检测中的六大核心挑战，在多个数据集上达到了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伪装目标检测面临传统分割方法和现代基础模型都无法有效处理的挑战，作者识别出六个根本性难题：内在相似性、边缘破坏、极端尺度变化、环境复杂性、上下文依赖性和显著-伪装目标区分，这些挑战经常同时出现并相互加剧检测难度。

Method: 提出C3Net双路径解码器架构：边缘细化路径使用梯度初始化的边缘增强模块从早期特征恢复精确边界；上下文定位路径采用基于图像的上下文引导机制实现内在显著性抑制；通过注意力融合模块协同结合两条路径。

Result: 在COD10K数据集上S-measure达到0.898，CAMO数据集上0.904，NC4K数据集上0.913，实现了最先进的性能，同时保持高效处理。

Conclusion: C3Net表明复杂多方面的检测挑战需要架构创新，专门组件协同工作才能实现超越孤立改进的全面覆盖。

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection identifies objects that blend seamlessly with their surroundings through similar colors, textures, and patterns. This task challenges both traditional segmentation methods and modern foundation models, which fail dramatically on camouflaged objects. We identify six fundamental challenges in COD: Intrinsic Similarity, Edge Disruption, Extreme Scale Variation, Environmental Complexities, Contextual Dependencies, and Salient-Camouflaged Object Disambiguation. These challenges frequently co-occur and compound the difficulty of detection, requiring comprehensive architectural solutions. We propose C3Net, which addresses all challenges through a specialized dual-pathway decoder architecture. The Edge Refinement Pathway employs gradient-initialized Edge Enhancement Modules to recover precise boundaries from early features. The Contextual Localization Pathway utilizes our novel Image-based Context Guidance mechanism to achieve intrinsic saliency suppression without external models. An Attentive Fusion Module synergistically combines the two pathways via spatial gating. C3Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with S-measures of 0.898 on COD10K, 0.904 on CAMO, and 0.913 on NC4K, while maintaining efficient processing. C3Net demonstrates that complex, multifaceted detection challenges require architectural innovation, with specialized components working synergistically to achieve comprehensive coverage beyond isolated improvements.

TL;DR: Seg-VAR将分割任务重新定义为条件自回归掩码生成问题，通过多阶段训练策略学习分割掩码的潜在表示，在多个分割任务上超越了之前的判别式和生成式方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉自回归建模策略在图像生成方面已取得进展，但在需要精确空间感知的分割任务中的潜力尚未被探索。受经典Mask2Former多尺度建模的启发，研究分割作为条件自回归掩码生成问题。

Method: 包含三个核心组件：图像编码器生成潜在先验、空间感知的seglat编码器将分割掩码映射为离散潜在token、解码器从潜在表示重建掩码。采用三阶段训练策略：图像-seglat联合训练学习表示、精炼潜在变换、对齐图像编码器与seglat分布。

Result: 实验表明Seg-VAR在各种分割任务和验证基准上超越了之前的判别式和生成式方法。

Conclusion: 通过将分割构建为序列层次预测任务，Seg-VAR为将自回归推理集成到空间感知视觉系统中开辟了新途径。

Abstract: While visual autoregressive modeling (VAR) strategies have shed light on image generation with the autoregressive models, their potential for segmentation, a task that requires precise low-level spatial perception, remains unexplored. Inspired by the multi-scale modeling of classic Mask2Former-based models, we propose Seg-VAR, a novel framework that rethinks segmentation as a conditional autoregressive mask generation problem. This is achieved by replacing the discriminative learning with the latent learning process. Specifically, our method incorporates three core components: (1) an image encoder generating latent priors from input images, (2) a spatial-aware seglat (a latent expression of segmentation mask) encoder that maps segmentation masks into discrete latent tokens using a location-sensitive color mapping to distinguish instances, and (3) a decoder reconstructing masks from these latents. A multi-stage training strategy is introduced: first learning seglat representations via image-seglat joint training, then refining latent transformations, and finally aligning image-encoder-derived latents with seglat distributions. Experiments show Seg-VAR outperforms previous discriminative and generative methods on various segmentation tasks and validation benchmarks. By framing segmentation as a sequential hierarchical prediction task, Seg-VAR opens new avenues for integrating autoregressive reasoning into spatial-aware vision systems. Code will be available at https://github.com/rkzheng99/Seg-VAR.

Motivation: 传统多模态特征融合方法难以实现有效的跨模态交互，导致生成效果不理想。需要解决异构模态表示之间的差异问题。

Method: 使用统一的token化策略处理语义掩码和文本输入；设计多变量变换器块实现同步条件处理；引入解耦注意力机制分离掩码token和时间嵌入的隐式依赖关系。

Result: 在保持性能的同时，将掩码条件引入的额外计算开销降低了94%以上；在面部保真度和条件一致性方面显著优于其他竞争方法。

Conclusion: MDiTFace通过创新的统一token化和解耦注意力机制，有效解决了多模态人脸生成中的跨模态交互问题，在性能和效率方面都取得了显著提升。

Abstract: While significant progress has been achieved in multimodal facial generation using semantic masks and textual descriptions, conventional feature fusion approaches often fail to enable effective cross-modal interactions, thereby leading to suboptimal generation outcomes. To address this challenge, we introduce MDiTFace--a customized diffusion transformer framework that employs a unified tokenization strategy to process semantic mask and text inputs, eliminating discrepancies between heterogeneous modality representations. The framework facilitates comprehensive multimodal feature interaction through stacked, newly designed multivariate transformer blocks that process all conditions synchronously. Additionally, we design a novel decoupled attention mechanism by dissociating implicit dependencies between mask tokens and temporal embeddings. This mechanism segregates internal computations into dynamic and static pathways, enabling caching and reuse of features computed in static pathways after initial calculation, thereby reducing additional computational overhead introduced by mask condition by over 94% while maintaining performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MDiTFace significantly outperforms other competing methods in terms of both facial fidelity and conditional consistency.

We propose a novel Single-Image Morphing Attack Detection (S-MAD) approach using a teacher-student framework, where a CNN-based teacher model refines a ViT-based student model. To improve efficiency, we integrate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for fine-tuning, reducing computational costs while maintaining high detection accuracy. Extensive experiments are conducted on a morphing dataset built from three publicly available face datasets, incorporating ten different morphing generation algorithms to assess robustness. The proposed method is benchmarked against six state-of-the-art S-MAD techniques, demonstrating superior detection performance and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: BridgeEQA为具身问答提供了具有挑战性的基准测试，EMVR方法通过顺序导航和推理有效解决了桥梁检查任务，公开了数据集和代码以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Deploying embodied agents that can answer questions about their surroundings in realistic real-world settings remains difficult, partly due to the scarcity of benchmarks that faithfully capture practical operating conditions. We propose infrastructure inspection as a compelling domain for open-vocabulary Embodied Question Answering (EQA): it naturally demands multi-scale reasoning, long-range spatial understanding, and complex semantic relationships, while offering unique evaluation advantages via standardized National Bridge Inventory (NBI) condition ratings (0-9), professional inspection reports, and egocentric imagery.
  We introduce BridgeEQA, a benchmark of 2,200 open-vocabulary question-answer pairs (in the style of OpenEQA) grounded in professional inspection reports across 200 real-world bridge scenes with 47.93 images on average per scene. Questions require synthesizing visual evidence across multiple images and aligning responses with NBI condition ratings. We further propose a new EQA metric Image Citation Relevance to evaluate the ability of a model to cite relevant images.
  Evaluations of state-of-the-art vision-language models reveal substantial performance gaps under episodic memory EQA settings. To address this, we propose Embodied Memory Visual Reasoning (EMVR), which formulates inspection as sequential navigation over an image-based scene graph: images are nodes, and an agent takes actions to traverse views, compare evidence, and reason within a Markov decision process. EMVR shows strong performance over the baselines. We publicly release both the dataset and code.

TL;DR: 提出了SoccerNet-GAR多模态数据集，比较视频和追踪数据在群体活动识别中的表现，发现基于追踪的方法在准确性和效率上都优于视频方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏标准化的基准来对齐广播视频和追踪数据用于群体活动识别，无法进行公平的模态比较。

Method: 构建了包含94,285个群体活动的多模态数据集，定义了统一评估协议，比较了视频分类器和基于图神经网络的追踪分类器。

Result: 追踪模型达到67.2%的平衡准确率，比最佳视频基线(58.1%)高出9.1个百分点，训练速度快4.25倍，参数少438倍。

Conclusion: 追踪数据在群体活动识别中优于视频数据，强调了模态选择和角色感知建模的重要性。

Abstract: Group Activity Recognition (GAR) is well studied on the video modality for surveillance and indoor team sports (e.g., volleyball, basketball). Yet, other modalities such as agent positions and trajectories over time, i.e. tracking, remain comparatively under-explored despite being compact, agent-centric signals that explicitly encode spatial interactions. Understanding whether pixel (video) or position (tracking) modalities leads to better group activity recognition is therefore important to drive further research on the topic. However, no standardized benchmark currently exists that aligns broadcast video and tracking data for the same group activities, leading to a lack of apples-to-apples comparison between these modalities for GAR. In this work, we introduce SoccerNet-GAR, a multimodal dataset built from the $64$ matches of the football World Cup 2022. Specifically, the broadcast videos and player tracking modalities for $94{,}285$ group activities are synchronized and annotated with $10$ categories. Furthermore, we define a unified evaluation protocol to benchmark two strong unimodal approaches: (i) a competitive video-based classifiers and (ii) a tracking-based classifiers leveraging graph neural networks. In particular, our novel role-aware graph architecture for tracking-based GAR directly encodes tactical structure through positional edges and temporal attention. Our tracking model achieves $67.2\%$ balanced accuracy compared to $58.1\%$ for the best video baseline, while training $4.25 \times$ faster with $438 \times$ fewer parameters ($197K$ \vs $86.3M$). This study provides new insights into the relative strengths of pixels and positions for group activity recognition. Overall, it highlights the importance of modality choice and role-aware modeling for GAR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决测试时适应中OOD样本被误分类为ID类别的问题，避免这种错误影响后续ID样本的适应过程

Method: 使用分层阶梯网络提取所有Transformer层的OOD特征，通过加权概率融合增强OOD检测；引入注意力仿射网络自适应优化自注意力机制；采用加权熵机制动态抑制低置信度样本

Result: 在基准数据集上显著提升了最常用分类数据集的性能

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了TTA中OOD样本带来的挑战，提高了模型在领域偏移下的适应能力和分类性能

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) refers to adjusting the model during the testing phase to cope with changes in sample distribution and enhance the model's adaptability to new environments. In real-world scenarios, models often encounter samples from unseen (out-of-distribution, OOD) categories. Misclassifying these as known (in-distribution, ID) classes not only degrades predictive accuracy but can also impair the adaptation process, leading to further errors on subsequent ID samples. Many existing TTA methods suffer substantial performance drops under such conditions. To address this challenge, we propose a Hierarchical Ladder Network that extracts OOD features from class tokens aggregated across all Transformer layers. OOD detection performance is enhanced by combining the original model prediction with the output of the Hierarchical Ladder Network (HLN) via weighted probability fusion. To improve robustness under domain shift, we further introduce an Attention Affine Network (AAN) that adaptively refines the self-attention mechanism conditioned on the token information to better adapt to domain drift, thereby improving the classification performance of the model on datasets with domain shift. Additionally, a weighted entropy mechanism is employed to dynamically suppress the influence of low-confidence samples during adaptation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our method significantly improves the performance on the most widely used classification datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割基础模型在分布外数据上表现不佳，容易产生碎片化的假阳性结果，需要提升模型对分布外肿瘤的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1) 使用LLM引导的解剖推理规划器定位器官锚点并生成多尺度ROI；2) 在ROI内对基础模型生成的候选区域进行双样本统计检验，只保留与正常组织显著不同的候选区域。

Result: 在多中心多模态肿瘤分割基准测试中，R²Seg在Dice系数、特异性和敏感性方面显著优于强基线方法和原始基础模型。

Conclusion: R²Seg无需参数更新，兼容零更新测试时间增强，避免了灾难性遗忘，为分布外肿瘤分割提供了有效的训练免费解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models for medical image segmentation struggle under out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts, often producing fragmented false positives on OOD tumors. We introduce R$^{2}$Seg, a training-free framework for robust OOD tumor segmentation that operates via a two-stage Reason-and-Reject process. First, the Reason step employs an LLM-guided anatomical reasoning planner to localize organ anchors and generate multi-scale ROIs. Second, the Reject step applies two-sample statistical testing to candidates generated by a frozen foundation model (BiomedParse) within these ROIs. This statistical rejection filter retains only candidates significantly different from normal tissue, effectively suppressing false positives. Our framework requires no parameter updates, making it compatible with zero-update test-time augmentation and avoiding catastrophic forgetting. On multi-center and multi-modal tumor segmentation benchmarks, R$^{2}$Seg substantially improves Dice, specificity, and sensitivity over strong baselines and the original foundation models.

TL;DR: HEDGE是一个统一的幻觉检测框架，通过视觉扰动、语义聚类和不确定性度量来检测视觉语言模型中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型容易产生幻觉，需要系统化的检测方法来评估多模态可靠性。

Method: 结合受控视觉扰动、语义聚类（基于蕴含和嵌入）和鲁棒不确定性度量，构建可复现的检测流程。

Result: 评估显示幻觉可检测性在密集视觉标记化模型中最高，嵌入聚类在生成答案上效果更好，VASE指标提供最鲁棒的幻觉信号。

Conclusion: HEDGE将幻觉检测构建为几何鲁棒性问题，为评估多模态可靠性提供了原则性基础。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) enable open-ended visual question answering but remain prone to hallucinations. We present HEDGE, a unified framework for hallucination detection that combines controlled visual perturbations, semantic clustering, and robust uncertainty metrics. HEDGE integrates sampling, distortion synthesis, clustering (entailment- and embedding-based), and metric computation into a reproducible pipeline applicable across multimodal architectures.
  Evaluations on VQA-RAD and KvasirVQA-x1 with three representative VLMs (LLaVA-Med, Med-Gemma, Qwen2.5-VL) reveal clear architecture- and prompt-dependent trends. Hallucination detectability is highest for unified-fusion models with dense visual tokenization (Qwen2.5-VL) and lowest for architectures with restricted tokenization (Med-Gemma). Embedding-based clustering often yields stronger separation when applied directly to the generated answers, whereas NLI-based clustering remains advantageous for LLaVA-Med and for longer, sentence-level responses. Across configurations, the VASE metric consistently provides the most robust hallucination signal, especially when paired with embedding clustering and a moderate sampling budget (n ~ 10-15). Prompt design also matters: concise, label-style outputs offer clearer semantic structure than syntactically constrained one-sentence responses.
  By framing hallucination detection as a geometric robustness problem shaped jointly by sampling scale, prompt structure, model architecture, and clustering strategy, HEDGE provides a principled, compute-aware foundation for evaluating multimodal reliability. The hedge-bench PyPI library enables reproducible and extensible benchmarking, with full code and experimental resources available at https://github.com/Simula/HEDGE .

Result: 实验表明，基于最优传输的方法生成的插值图像比其他标准插值方法更平滑、更连贯，验证了将嵌入视为点云能更好地反映和利用嵌入空间的几何特性。

Conclusion: 将CLIP嵌入视为Wasserstein空间中的点云而非欧几里得空间中的矩阵，通过最优传输方法进行插值，能够生成更高质量的插值图像，这为理解嵌入空间的几何结构提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: It can be shown that Stable Diffusion has a permutation-invariance property with respect to the rows of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) embedding matrices. This inspired the novel observation that these embeddings can naturally be interpreted as point clouds in a Wasserstein space rather than as matrices in a Euclidean space. This perspective opens up new possibilities for understanding the geometry of embedding space. For example, when interpolating between embeddings of two distinct prompts, we propose reframing the interpolation problem as an optimal transport problem. By solving this optimal transport problem, we compute a shortest path (or geodesic) between embeddings that captures a more natural and geometrically smooth transition through the embedding space. This results in smoother and more coherent intermediate (interpolated) images when rendered by the Stable Diffusion generative model. We conduct experiments to investigate this effect, comparing the quality of interpolated images produced using optimal transport to those generated by other standard interpolation methods. The novel optimal transport--based approach presented indeed gives smoother image interpolations, suggesting that viewing the embeddings as point clouds (rather than as matrices) better reflects and leverages the geometry of the embedding space.

TL;DR: 提出Denoising-VAE，通过频谱自正则化策略抑制高维潜在空间中的冗余高频噪声，解决了VAE在高维潜在空间中重建保真度与生成性能的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VAE在高维潜在空间中存在优化困境：高维空间能提高重建保真度，但会损害生成性能。现有方法依赖外部视觉基础模型进行正则化，但高维潜在如何影响生成模型优化仍不清楚。

Method: 提出频谱自正则化策略抑制冗余高频噪声，同时保持重建质量；引入频谱对齐策略优化基于Denoising-VAE的生成模型；使用ViT-based自编码器，不依赖外部视觉基础模型。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256基准上：重建质量达到SOTA（rFID=0.28，PSNR=27.26），生成性能具有竞争力（gFID=1.82），扩散模型收敛速度比SD-VAE快约2倍。

Conclusion: Denoising-VAE通过抑制高维潜在空间中的冗余高频噪声，有效解决了VAE的优化困境，在保持优秀重建质量的同时显著提升了生成性能和训练效率。

Abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAEs) typically encode images into a compact latent space, reducing computational cost but introducing an optimization dilemma: a higher-dimensional latent space improves reconstruction fidelity but often hampers generative performance. Recent methods attempt to address this dilemma by regularizing high-dimensional latent spaces using external vision foundation models (VFMs). However, it remains unclear how high-dimensional VAE latents affect the optimization of generative models. To our knowledge, our analysis is the first to reveal that redundant high-frequency components in high-dimensional latent spaces hinder the training convergence of diffusion models and, consequently, degrade generation quality. To alleviate this problem, we propose a spectral self-regularization strategy to suppress redundant high-frequency noise while simultaneously preserving reconstruction quality. The resulting Denoising-VAE, a ViT-based autoencoder that does not rely on VFMs, produces cleaner, lower-noise latents, leading to improved generative quality and faster optimization convergence. We further introduce a spectral alignment strategy to facilitate the optimization of Denoising-VAE-based generative models. Our complete method enables diffusion models to converge approximately 2$\times$ faster than with SD-VAE, while achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality (rFID = 0.28, PSNR = 27.26) and competitive generation performance (gFID = 1.82) on the ImageNet 256$\times$256 benchmark.

Result: 在多个医疗图像数据集上的广泛实验表明，CILMP始终优于最先进的提示调优方法。

Conclusion: CILMP通过桥接LLM和VLM，有效将医疗知识转移到VLM提示中，提高了医疗图像分类的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Vision-language foundation models (VLMs) have shown great potential in feature transfer and generalization across a wide spectrum of medical-related downstream tasks. However, fine-tuning these models is resource-intensive due to their large number of parameters. Prompt tuning has emerged as a viable solution to mitigate memory usage and reduce training time while maintaining competitive performance. Nevertheless, the challenge is that existing prompt tuning methods cannot precisely distinguish different kinds of medical concepts, which miss essentially specific disease-related features across various medical imaging modalities in medical image classification tasks. We find that Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on extensive text corpora, are particularly adept at providing this specialized medical knowledge. Motivated by this, we propose incorporating LLMs into the prompt tuning process. Specifically, we introduce the CILMP, Conditional Intervention of Large Language Models for Prompt Tuning, a method that bridges LLMs and VLMs to facilitate the transfer of medical knowledge into VLM prompts. CILMP extracts disease-specific representations from LLMs, intervenes within a low-rank linear subspace, and utilizes them to create disease-specific prompts. Additionally, a conditional mechanism is incorporated to condition the intervention process on each individual medical image, generating instance-adaptive prompts and thus enhancing adaptability. Extensive experiments across diverse medical image datasets demonstrate that CILMP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art prompt tuning methods, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Method: 采用可学习尺度参数化、VO前端浮点伪量化（FP16/FP32）和后端全精度的异构精度设计，以及用于伪量化的GPU原生内核融合（自定义CUDA内核）。

Result: 在TartanAir数据集上，平均FPS提高52.1%，中位延迟降低29.1%，峰值GPU内存占用减少64.9%；在EuRoC数据集上，平均FPS提高30.1%，中位延迟降低23.1%，峰值GPU内存占用减少37.7%，同时保持与原始DPVO模型相当的轨迹精度。

Conclusion: DPVO-QAT++有效弥合了高精度深度VO与实际部署效率要求之间的差距，为该技术在现实世界嵌入式平台上的应用提供了可行的工程范例。

Abstract: Deep learning-based Visual SLAM (vSLAM) systems exhibit exceptional geometric reasoning capabilities, yet their prohibitive computational overhead severely restricts deployment on resource-constrained autonomous platforms. This paper presents a hierarchical quantization optimization framework, DPVO-QAT++ (DPVO-QAT++: Heterogeneous QAT and CUDA Kernel Fusion for High-Performance Deep Patch Visual Odometry). Through the synergistic integration of learnable scale parameterization, a heterogeneous precision design for the Visual Odometry (VO) front-end and back-end (front-end floating-point fake quantization with FP16/FP32; back-end full precision), and GPU-native kernel fusion for fake quantization (custom CUDA kernels), our framework significantly reduces memory footprint and increases processing speed while preserving the trajectory accuracy of the original model. On the TartanAir dataset, our framework achieves an average FPS increase of 52.1%, a 29.1% reduction in median latency, and a 64.9% reduction in peak GPU memory reservation, while maintaining trajectory accuracy (ATE) comparable to the original DPVO model across 32 validation sequences. On the EuRoC dataset, it realizes an average FPS increase of 30.1%, a 23.1% reduction in median latency, and a 37.7% reduction in peak GPU memory reservation, maintaining comparable trajectory accuracy (ATE) across 11 validation sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that DPVO-QAT++ effectively bridges the gap between high-precision deep VO and the efficiency requirements for practical deployment, offering a viable engineering paradigm for the application of this technology on real-world embedded platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伪装目标检测面临低光照、部分遮挡、小目标、复杂背景模式和多目标等挑战，现有方法在复杂场景中仍难以精确检测伪装目标，特别是在小目标和多目标情况下。

Method: 使用金字塔视觉Transformer作为骨干网络提取多尺度特征，通过注意力机制进行特征融合，采用递归反馈解码策略和细粒度融合单元来优化特征表示。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上达到了最先进的性能，在另外两个数据集上排名第二，能够成功检测小目标和多目标伪装对象。

Conclusion: 通过联合利用多尺度学习和递归特征优化，提出的方法在伪装目标检测任务中取得了显著性能提升，证明了多尺度特征提取和递归优化策略的有效性。

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection is an emerging and challenging computer vision task that requires identifying and segmenting objects that blend seamlessly into their environments due to high similarity in color, texture, and size. This task is further complicated by low-light conditions, partial occlusion, small object size, intricate background patterns, and multiple objects. While many sophisticated methods have been proposed for this task, current methods still struggle to precisely detect camouflaged objects in complex scenarios, especially with small and multiple objects, indicating room for improvement. We propose a Multi-Scale Recursive Network that extracts multi-scale features via a Pyramid Vision Transformer backbone and combines them via specialized Attention-Based Scale Integration Units, enabling selective feature merging. For more precise object detection, our decoder recursively refines features by incorporating Multi-Granularity Fusion Units. A novel recursive-feedback decoding strategy is developed to enhance global context understanding, helping the model overcome the challenges in this task. By jointly leveraging multi-scale learning and recursive feature optimization, our proposed method achieves performance gains, successfully detecting small and multiple camouflaged objects. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on two benchmark datasets for camouflaged object detection and ranks second on the remaining two.

Conclusion: FSTS框架能够生成反映真实伪造痕迹的多样化训练数据，有效解决了文本图像伪造定位中的泛化问题。

Abstract: Existing Text Image Forgery Localization (T-IFL) methods often suffer from poor generalization due to the limited scale of real-world datasets and the distribution gap caused by synthetic data that fails to capture the complexity of real-world tampering. To tackle this issue, we propose Fourier Series-based Tampering Synthesis (FSTS), a structured and interpretable framework for synthesizing tampered text images. FSTS first collects 16,750 real-world tampering instances from five representative tampering types, using a structured pipeline that records human-performed editing traces via multi-format logs (e.g., video, PSD, and editing logs). By analyzing these collected parameters and identifying recurring behavioral patterns at both individual and population levels, we formulate a hierarchical modeling framework. Specifically, each individual tampering parameter is represented as a compact combination of basis operation-parameter configurations, while the population-level distribution is constructed by aggregating these behaviors. Since this formulation draws inspiration from the Fourier series, it enables an interpretable approximation using basis functions and their learned weights. By sampling from this modeled distribution, FSTS synthesizes diverse and realistic training data that better reflect real-world forgery traces. Extensive experiments across four evaluation protocols demonstrate that models trained with FSTS data achieve significantly improved generalization on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: SAGA为法医和监管应用提供了关键且可解释的洞察，能够在大规模上实现AI生成视频的源归属，解决了当前检测方法的局限性。

Abstract: The proliferation of generative AI has led to hyper-realistic synthetic videos, escalating misuse risks and outstripping binary real/fake detectors. We introduce SAGA (Source Attribution of Generative AI videos), the first comprehensive framework to address the urgent need for AI-generated video source attribution at a large scale. Unlike traditional detection, SAGA identifies the specific generative model used. It uniquely provides multi-granular attribution across five levels: authenticity, generation task (e.g., T2V/I2V), model version, development team, and the precise generator, offering far richer forensic insights. Our novel video transformer architecture, leveraging features from a robust vision foundation model, effectively captures spatio-temporal artifacts. Critically, we introduce a data-efficient pretrain-and-attribute strategy, enabling SAGA to achieve state-of-the-art attribution using only 0.5\% of source-labeled data per class, matching fully supervised performance. Furthermore, we propose Temporal Attention Signatures (T-Sigs), a novel interpretability method that visualizes learned temporal differences, offering the first explanation for why different video generators are distinguishable. Extensive experiments on public datasets, including cross-domain scenarios, demonstrate that SAGA sets a new benchmark for synthetic video provenance, providing crucial, interpretable insights for forensic and regulatory applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Zero123模型特征的任务感知评估框架，包含参考评分D_PRISM和无参考评分MMD_PRISM，用于可靠评估新视角合成质量，解决现有指标难以衡量生成图像真实性和视角变换忠实度的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有新视角合成评估指标无法准确判断生成图像是否既真实又忠实于源视图和视角变换，标准指标经常错误地将不正确结果排名靠前。

Method: 利用Zero123强基础模型的特征，结合轻量级调优步骤增强判别能力，提出参考评分D_PRISM和无参考评分MMD_PRISM两个互补评估指标。

Result: 在Toys4K、Google Scanned Objects和OmniObject3D三个基准测试中，MMD_PRISM对六种NVS方法产生了清晰稳定的排名，较低分数始终对应更强的模型，与人类偏好研究一致。

Conclusion: 该框架为新视角合成评估提供了原则性和实用性的方法，为更可靠的新视角合成进展铺平道路。

Abstract: The goal of Novel View Synthesis (NVS) is to generate realistic images of a given content from unseen viewpoints. But how can we trust that a generated image truly reflects the intended transformation? Evaluating its reliability remains a major challenge. While recent generative models, particularly diffusion-based approaches, have significantly improved NVS quality, existing evaluation metrics struggle to assess whether a generated image is both realistic and faithful to the source view and intended viewpoint transformation. Standard metrics, such as pixel-wise similarity and distribution-based measures, often mis-rank incorrect results as they fail to capture the nuanced relationship between the source image, viewpoint change, and generated output. We propose a task-aware evaluation framework that leverages features from a strong NVS foundation model, Zero123, combined with a lightweight tuning step to enhance discrimination. Using these features, we introduce two complementary evaluation metrics: a reference-based score, $D_{\text{PRISM}}$, and a reference-free score, $\text{MMD}_{\text{PRISM}}$. Both reliably identify incorrect generations and rank models in agreement with human preference studies, addressing a fundamental gap in NVS evaluation. Our framework provides a principled and practical approach to assessing synthesis quality, paving the way for more reliable progress in novel view synthesis. To further support this goal, we apply our reference-free metric to six NVS methods across three benchmarks: Toys4K, Google Scanned Objects (GSO), and OmniObject3D, where $\text{MMD}_{\text{PRISM}}$ produces a clear and stable ranking, with lower scores consistently indicating stronger models.

TL;DR: 本文提出视觉思维链(vCoT)方法，通过生成帧间过渡事件描述来增强多模态大语言模型的视频理解能力。研究发现视频微调模型已隐式掌握时序推理能力，而图像模型可通过vCoT显著提升长视频问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型从图像扩展到视频时，通常只是简单拼接帧标记，缺乏有效的时序推理能力。本文旨在探究视频微调对多模态LLMs的真正贡献。

Method: 提出视觉思维链(vCoT)方法，生成连续帧之间的过渡事件描述作为显式推理过程。系统比较了仅图像模型与视频微调模型在有/无过渡线索情况下的表现。

Result: vCoT显著提升了仅图像模型在长视频问答中的性能，但对视频微调模型增益有限，表明后者已隐式掌握帧间过渡推理。视频模型还能将时序推理能力迁移到静态场景，在关系视觉推理任务中超越图像模型基线。

Conclusion: 视频微调使多模态LLMs获得了隐式的时序推理能力，而vCoT为图像模型提供了有效的显式推理框架，两者在视频理解和关系推理方面都展现出重要价值。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (LLMs) have made rapid progress in visual understanding, yet their extension from images to videos often reduces to a naive concatenation of frame tokens. In this work, we investigate what video finetuning brings to multimodal LLMs. We propose Visual Chain-of-Thought (vCoT), an explicit reasoning process that generates transitional event descriptions between consecutive frames. Using vCoT, we systematically compare image-only LVLMs with their video-finetuned counterparts, both with and without access to these transitional cues. Our experiments show that vCoT significantly improves the performance of image-only models on long-form video question answering, while yielding only marginal gains for video-finetuned models. This suggests that the latter already capture frame-to-frame transitions implicitly. Moreover, we find that video models transfer this temporal reasoning ability to purely static settings, outperforming image models' baselines on relational visual reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: DeepSport为领域特定视频推理建立了新基础，能够应对多样化运动的复杂性，将范式从被动帧处理转向主动迭代推理。

Abstract: Sports video understanding presents unique challenges, requiring models to perceive high-speed dynamics, comprehend complex rules, and reason over long temporal contexts. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in genral domains, the current state of research in sports remains narrowly focused: existing approaches are either single-sport centric, limited to specific tasks, or rely on training-free paradigms that lack robust, learned reasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce DeepSport, the first end-to-end trained MLLM framework designed for multi-task, multi-sport video understanding. DeepSport shifts the paradigm from passive frame processing to active, iterative reasoning, empowering the model to ``think with videos'' by dynamically interrogating content via a specialized frame-extraction tool. To enable this, we propose a data distillation pipeline that synthesizes high-quality Chain-of-Thought (CoT) trajectories from 10 diverse data source, creating a unified resource of 78k training data. We then employ a two-stage training strategy, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a novel gated tool-use reward, to optimize the model's reasoning process. Extensive experiments on the testing benchmark of 6.7k questions demonstrate that DeepSport achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming baselines of both proprietary model and open-source models. Our work establishes a new foundation for domain-specific video reasoning to address the complexities of diverse sports.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管状态空间模型(特别是Mamba架构)在序列建模中表现出色，但由于缺乏类似注意力的透明机制，理解它们如何处理空间信息仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 提出了两种互补方法：适用于任何SSM架构的基于雅可比矩阵的方法，以及针对对角SSMs的基于格拉姆矩阵的方法，两者都在单次前向传播中运行，具有线性复杂度。

Result: 在三种不同医学成像模态上的实验表明，SSMs自然实现了从早期层的扩散低层次纹理到深层聚焦的临床意义模式的分层特征细化。

Conclusion: 该框架确立了可控性分析作为跨所有领域的SSMs的统一、基础可解释性范式。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), particularly the Mamba architecture, have recently emerged as powerful alternatives to Transformers for sequence modeling, offering linear computational complexity while achieving competitive performance. Yet, despite their effectiveness, understanding how these Vision SSMs process spatial information remains challenging due to the lack of transparent, attention-like mechanisms. To address this gap, we introduce a controllability-based interpretability framework that quantifies how different parts of the input sequence (tokens or patches) influence the internal state dynamics of SSMs. We propose two complementary formulations: a Jacobian-based method applicable to any SSM architecture that measures influence through the full chain of state propagation, and a Gramian-based approach for diagonal SSMs that achieves superior speed through closed-form analytical solutions. Both methods operate in a single forward pass with linear complexity, requiring no architectural modifications or hyperparameter tuning. We validate our framework through experiments on three diverse medical imaging modalities, demonstrating that SSMs naturally implement hierarchical feature refinement from diffuse low-level textures in early layers to focused, clinically meaningful patterns in deeper layers. Our analysis reveals domain-specific controllability signatures aligned with diagnostic criteria, progressive spatial selectivity across the network hierarchy, and the substantial influence of scanning strategies on attention patterns. Beyond medical imaging, we articulate applications spanning computer vision, natural language processing, and cross-domain tasks. Our framework establishes controllability analysis as a unified, foundational interpretability paradigm for SSMs across all domains. Code and analysis tools will be made available upon publication

Motivation: 现有目标计数方法在遮挡条件下表现不佳，因为主干网络编码的是遮挡表面而非目标物体，导致特征表示被破坏。

Method: 通过整合可见片段的空间上下文与文本和视觉嵌入的语义先验，在多个金字塔层级上合成完整的表示；引入视觉等价目标确保遮挡和非遮挡视图产生空间对齐的注意力图。

Conclusion: CountOCC通过互补机制在遮挡条件下保持判别特性，在不同视觉领域实现鲁棒的模态计数。

Abstract: Object counting has achieved remarkable success on visible instances, yet state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods fail under occlusion, a pervasive challenge in real world deployment. This failure stems from a fundamental architectural limitation where backbone networks encode occluding surfaces rather than target objects, thereby corrupting the feature representations required for accurate enumeration. To address this, we present CountOCC, an amodal counting framework that explicitly reconstructs occluded object features through hierarchical multimodal guidance. Rather than accepting degraded encodings, we synthesize complete representations by integrating spatial context from visible fragments with semantic priors from text and visual embeddings, generating class-discriminative features at occluded locations across multiple pyramid levels. We further introduce a visual equivalence objective that enforces consistency in attention space, ensuring that both occluded and unoccluded views of the same scene produce spatially aligned gradient-based attention maps. Together, these complementary mechanisms preserve discriminative properties essential for accurate counting under occlusion. For rigorous evaluation, we establish occlusion-augmented versions of FSC 147 and CARPK spanning both structured and unstructured scenes. CountOCC achieves SOTA performance on FSC 147 with 26.72% and 20.80% MAE reduction over prior baselines under occlusion in validation and test, respectively. CountOCC also demonstrates exceptional generalization by setting new SOTA results on CARPK with 49.89% MAE reduction and on CAPTUREReal with 28.79% MAE reduction, validating robust amodal counting across diverse visual domains. Code will be released soon.

Abstract: Understanding where drivers look and why they shift their attention is essential for autonomous systems that read human intent and justify their actions. Most existing models rely on large-scale gaze datasets to learn these patterns; however, such datasets are labor-intensive to collect and time-consuming to curate. We present FSDAM (Few-Shot Driver Attention Modeling), a framework that achieves joint attention prediction and caption generation with approximately 100 annotated examples, two orders of magnitude fewer than existing approaches. Our approach introduces a dual-pathway architecture where separate modules handle spatial prediction and caption generation while maintaining semantic consistency through cross-modal alignment. Despite minimal supervision, FSDAM achieves competitive performance on attention prediction, generates coherent, and context-aware explanations. The model demonstrates robust zero-shot generalization across multiple driving benchmarks. This work shows that effective attention-conditioned generation is achievable with limited supervision, opening new possibilities for practical deployment of explainable driver attention systems in data-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has demonstrated high performance in image classification tasks by effectively utilizing both labeled and unlabeled data. However, existing SSL methods often suffer from poor calibration, with models yielding overconfident predictions that misrepresent actual prediction likelihoods. Recently, neural networks trained with {\tt mixup} that linearly interpolates random examples from the training set have shown better calibration in supervised settings. However, calibration of neural models remains under-explored in semi-supervised settings. Although effective in supervised model calibration, random mixup of pseudolabels in SSL presents challenges due to the overconfidence and unreliability of pseudolabels. In this work, we introduce CalibrateMix, a targeted mixup-based approach that aims to improve the calibration of SSL models while maintaining or even improving their classification accuracy. Our method leverages training dynamics of labeled and unlabeled samples to identify ``easy-to-learn'' and ``hard-to-learn'' samples, which in turn are utilized in a targeted mixup of easy and hard samples. Experimental results across several benchmark image datasets show that our method achieves lower expected calibration error (ECE) and superior accuracy compared to existing SSL approaches.

TL;DR: 首次研究开放词汇目标检测器(OVOD)的后门攻击，提出TrAP多模态后门注入策略，通过联合优化图像和文本模态的提示参数与视觉触发器，实现无需重新训练基础模型权重的轻量级后门植入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着OVOD模型在机器人、自动驾驶等高风险应用中的普及，理解其安全风险变得至关重要，特别是由提示调优引入的新攻击面。

Method: 提出TrAP策略，联合优化图像和文本模态的提示参数与视觉触发器，采用课程式训练策略逐步缩小触发器尺寸，实现小触发器补丁的有效后门激活。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，TrAP在对象误分类和对象消失攻击中均实现高攻击成功率，同时在下游数据集上相比零样本设置提高了干净图像性能。

Conclusion: TrAP揭示了OVOD模型在提示调优场景下的安全漏洞，为多模态模型的安全研究提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detectors (OVODs) unify vision and language to detect arbitrary object categories based on text prompts, enabling strong zero-shot generalization to novel concepts. As these models gain traction in high-stakes applications such as robotics, autonomous driving, and surveillance, understanding their security risks becomes crucial. In this work, we conduct the first study of backdoor attacks on OVODs and reveal a new attack surface introduced by prompt tuning. We propose TrAP (Trigger-Aware Prompt tuning), a multi-modal backdoor injection strategy that jointly optimizes prompt parameters in both image and text modalities along with visual triggers. TrAP enables the attacker to implant malicious behavior using lightweight, learnable prompt tokens without retraining the base model weights, thus preserving generalization while embedding a hidden backdoor. We adopt a curriculum-based training strategy that progressively shrinks the trigger size, enabling effective backdoor activation using small trigger patches at inference. Experiments across multiple datasets show that TrAP achieves high attack success rates for both object misclassification and object disappearance attacks, while also improving clean image performance on downstream datasets compared to the zero-shot setting.

TL;DR: 提出UNSEEN框架，从泛化角度进行数据集剪枝，通过使用未在训练中接触过样本的模型来评分，显著提升剪枝效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集剪枝方法主要依赖训练阶段的模型性能来评分，导致样本分数分布密集，难以有效区分代表性样本。需要从泛化角度改进评分机制。

Method: 提出UNSEEN框架：1) 使用未接触过样本的模型进行评分；2) 扩展到多步场景，通过在不同coreset上训练的模型进行增量选择；3) 动态优化coreset质量。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet-1K上显著优于现有SOTA方法。在ImageNet-1K上，减少30%训练数据仍能实现无损性能。

Conclusion: 从泛化角度进行数据集剪枝比传统拟合中心方法更有效，UNSEEN框架能显著提升剪枝效果并保持模型性能。

Abstract: The growing scale of datasets in deep learning has introduced significant computational challenges. Dataset pruning addresses this challenge by constructing a compact but informative coreset from the full dataset with comparable performance. Previous approaches typically establish scoring metrics based on specific criteria to identify representative samples. However, these methods predominantly rely on sample scores obtained from the model's performance during the training (i.e., fitting) phase. As scoring models achieve near-optimal performance on training data, such fitting-centric approaches induce a dense distribution of sample scores within a narrow numerical range. This concentration reduces the distinction between samples and hinders effective selection. To address this challenge, we conduct dataset pruning from the perspective of generalization, i.e., scoring samples based on models not exposed to them during training. We propose a plug-and-play framework, UNSEEN, which can be integrated into existing dataset pruning methods. Additionally, conventional score-based methods are single-step and rely on models trained solely on the complete dataset, providing limited perspective on the importance of samples. To address this limitation, we scale UNSEEN to multi-step scenarios and propose an incremental selection technique through scoring models trained on varying coresets, and optimize the quality of the coreset dynamically. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K. Notably, on ImageNet-1K, UNSEEN achieves lossless performance while reducing training data by 30\%.

*Parsa Esmaeilkhani,Longin Jan Latecki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的注意力监督损失函数（KLAL），通过直接监督视觉标记的注意力分布来改善视觉语言模型在视觉任务中的表现，解决了现有模型在最终层对相关视觉标记关注不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在LLM模块的最终层中，与查询最相关的视觉标记往往得不到足够的注意力，这可能导致视觉问答任务中的错误答案。标准的下一标记预测损失无法有效引导对视觉标记的关注。

Method: 提出KL注意力损失（KLAL），通过KL散度将视觉标记的注意力分布与真实注意力图对齐。真实注意力图来自合成案例的任务几何或真实图像中的标注（如边界框），在LLM内部进行注意力监督而无需新标签。

Result: 该方法在几何任务、指向和指代表达理解等任务上均取得显著改进，在合成和真实世界数据上都表现出色。还引入了一个新的线追踪数据集，发现即使是商业VLM在该任务上表现也不佳。

Conclusion: 直接监督视觉标记的注意力分布能有效提升VLMs在视觉任务上的性能，KLAL与NTP损失结合使用能鼓励模型在生成答案标记时关注相关视觉标记。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) mix visual tokens and text tokens. A puzzling issue is the fact that visual tokens most related to the query receive little to no attention in the final layers of the LLM module of VLMs from the answer tokens, where all tokens are treated equally, in particular, visual and language tokens in the LLM attention layers. This fact may result in wrong answers to visual questions, as our experimental results confirm. It appears that the standard next-token prediction (NTP) loss provides an insufficient signal for directing attention to visual tokens. We hypothesize that a more direct supervision of the attention of visual tokens to corresponding language tokens in the LLM module of VLMs will lead to improved performance on visual tasks. To demonstrate that this is indeed the case, we propose a novel loss function that directly supervises the attention of visual tokens. It directly grounds the answer language tokens in images by directing their attention to the relevant visual tokens. This is achieved by aligning the attention distribution of visual tokens to ground truth attention maps with KL divergence. The ground truth attention maps are obtained from task geometry in synthetic cases or from standard grounding annotations (e.g., bounding boxes or point annotations) in real images, and are used inside the LLM for attention supervision without requiring new labels. The obtained KL attention loss (KLAL) when combined with NTP encourages VLMs to attend to relevant visual tokens while generating answer tokens. This results in notable improvements across geometric tasks, pointing, and referring expression comprehension on both synthetic and real-world data, as demonstrated by our experiments. We also introduce a new dataset to evaluate the line tracing abilities of VLMs. Surprisingly, even commercial VLMs do not perform well on this task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SAGE方法，通过引导式提示选择来缓解CLIP模型中的多模态伪相关性偏差，无需训练或微调即可提升零样本分类的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型存在多模态伪相关性偏差，即模型倾向于依赖虚假特征（如背景与对象的共现关系）而非核心特征进行推理，这严重影响了模型在分布外数据上的鲁棒性。现有方法通常需要下游数据微调或先验知识，破坏了CLIP的开箱即用特性。

Method: 提出SAGE方法：首先理论分析多模态伪相关性偏差对零样本分类的影响，然后通过探索提示模板空间，选择能够诱导类别间最大语义分离的提示，从而改善最差组鲁棒性。

Result: 在四个真实世界基准数据集和五个流行骨干模型上的广泛实验表明，SAGE一致地提升了零样本性能和泛化能力，在无需外部知识或模型更新的情况下优于之前的零样本方法。

Conclusion: SAGE是一种简单有效的零样本方法，能够有效缓解CLIP模型中的多模态伪相关性偏差，提高模型在分布外数据上的鲁棒性，同时保持开箱即用的特性。

Abstract: Large vision-language models, such as CLIP, have shown strong zero-shot classification performance by aligning images and text in a shared embedding space. However, CLIP models often develop multimodal spurious biases, which is the undesirable tendency to rely on spurious features. For example, CLIP may infer object types in images based on frequently co-occurring backgrounds rather than the object's core features. This bias significantly impairs the robustness of pre-trained CLIP models on out-of-distribution data, where such cross-modal associations no longer hold. Existing methods for mitigating multimodal spurious bias typically require fine-tuning on downstream data or prior knowledge of the bias, which undermines the out-of-the-box usability of CLIP. In this paper, we first theoretically analyze the impact of multimodal spurious bias in zero-shot classification. Based on this insight, we propose Spuriousness-Aware Guided Exploration (SAGE), a simple and effective method that mitigates spurious bias through guided prompt selection. SAGE requires no training, fine-tuning, or external annotations. It explores a space of prompt templates and selects the prompts that induce the largest semantic separation between classes, thereby improving worst-group robustness. Extensive experiments on four real-world benchmark datasets and five popular backbone models demonstrate that SAGE consistently improves zero-shot performance and generalization, outperforming previous zero-shot approaches without any external knowledge or model updates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 体素化是降低LiDAR数据处理计算成本的有效方法，但会导致细尺度结构信息丢失。本研究旨在探索是否可以从高级别的体素化LiDAR点云数据中推断低级别的体素内容信息，特别是目标在体素内的占用百分比。

Method: 提出基于核点卷积（KPConv）的多目标回归方法，针对类别不平衡问题采用密度相关（DBR）的成本敏感学习策略，使用加权均方误差、焦点回归和正则化来优化KPConv。对体素尺寸（0.25-2米）进行敏感性分析。

Result: 敏感性分析显示，较大体素尺寸（如2米）由于变异性减少而误差较低，而较小体素尺寸（如0.25或0.5米）在树冠区域误差较高。对于树皮和树叶目标，小体素尺寸数据集的误差值显著高于大体素尺寸数据集。

Conclusion: 体素尺寸的选择取决于具体应用需求。本研究填补了深度不平衡学习模型在多目标回归和森林3D LiDAR点云模拟数据集方面的空白。

Abstract: Voxelization is an effective approach to reduce the computational cost of processing Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, yet it results in a loss of fine-scale structural information. This study explores whether low-level voxel content information, specifically target occupancy percentage within a voxel, can be inferred from high-level voxelized LiDAR point cloud data collected from Digital Imaging and remote Sensing Image Generation (DIRSIG) software. In our study, the targets include bark, leaf, soil, and miscellaneous materials. We propose a multi-target regression approach in the context of imbalanced learning using Kernel Point Convolutions (KPConv). Our research leverages cost-sensitive learning to address class imbalance called density-based relevance (DBR). We employ weighted Mean Saquared Erorr (MSE), Focal Regression (FocalR), and regularization to improve the optimization of KPConv. This study performs a sensitivity analysis on the voxel size (0.25 - 2 meters) to evaluate the effect of various grid representations in capturing the nuances of the forest. This sensitivity analysis reveals that larger voxel sizes (e.g., 2 meters) result in lower errors due to reduced variability, while smaller voxel sizes (e.g., 0.25 or 0.5 meter) exhibit higher errors, particularly within the canopy, where variability is greatest. For bark and leaf targets, error values at smaller voxel size datasets (0.25 and 0.5 meter) were significantly higher than those in larger voxel size datasets (2 meters), highlighting the difficulty in accurately estimating within-canopy voxel content at fine resolutions. This suggests that the choice of voxel size is application-dependent. Our work fills the gap in deep imbalance learning models for multi-target regression and simulated datasets for 3D LiDAR point clouds of forests.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MeanFlow在SD-VAE潜在空间中训练计算量大且不稳定，推理时解码器成本高，且需要复杂引导参数。

Method: 在RAE潜在空间中训练，采用一致性中期训练进行轨迹感知初始化，使用两阶段方案：从预训练流匹配教师蒸馏加速收敛，可选引导阶段使用单点速度估计器减少偏差。

Result: 在ImageNet 256上实现1步FID 2.03，优于vanilla MF的3.43，采样GFLOPS减少38%，总训练成本降低83%。在ImageNet 512上达到1步FID 3.23，在所有基线中GFLOPS最低。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了MeanFlow的训练效率和生成质量，简化了训练配置，降低了计算成本。

Abstract: MeanFlow (MF) is a diffusion-motivated generative model that enables efficient few-step generation by learning long jumps directly from noise to data. In practice, it is often used as a latent MF by leveraging the pre-trained Stable Diffusion variational autoencoder (SD-VAE) for high-dimensional data modeling. However, MF training remains computationally demanding and is often unstable. During inference, the SD-VAE decoder dominates the generation cost, and MF depends on complex guidance hyperparameters for class-conditional generation. In this work, we develop an efficient training and sampling scheme for MF in the latent space of a Representation Autoencoder (RAE), where a pre-trained vision encoder (e.g., DINO) provides semantically rich latents paired with a lightweight decoder. We observe that naive MF training in the RAE latent space suffers from severe gradient explosion. To stabilize and accelerate training, we adopt Consistency Mid-Training for trajectory-aware initialization and use a two-stage scheme: distillation from a pre-trained flow matching teacher to speed convergence and reduce variance, followed by an optional bootstrapping stage with a one-point velocity estimator to further reduce deviation from the oracle mean flow. This design removes the need for guidance, simplifies training configurations, and reduces computation in both training and sampling. Empirically, our method achieves a 1-step FID of 2.03, outperforming vanilla MF's 3.43, while reducing sampling GFLOPS by 38% and total training cost by 83% on ImageNet 256. We further scale our approach to ImageNet 512, achieving a competitive 1-step FID of 3.23 with the lowest GFLOPS among all baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/sony/mf-rae.

TL;DR: SAGE是一种通过对比嵌入将人类显著性先验整合到神经网络训练中的损失函数，在潜在空间而非图像空间中引导模型关注显著特征，提升分类性能。

Motivation: 现有基于显著性的训练方法依赖模型内部机制，可能不可靠。挑战主要源于仅在图像空间进行指导，因此需要转向潜在空间嵌入来引导人类先验。

Method: 使用对比嵌入方法，对输入应用显著性保持和显著性退化信号增强，捕捉嵌入和模型logits的变化，通过对比三元组损失引导模型关注显著特征并远离非显著特征，同时对logits分布进行完整性检查。

Conclusion: SAGE通过在潜在空间而非图像空间整合人类显著性指导，提供了一种更可靠的显著性引导训练方法，能够有效提升模型性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Integrating human perceptual priors into the training of neural networks has been shown to raise model generalization, serve as an effective regularizer, and align models with human expertise for applications in high-risk domains. Existing approaches to integrate saliency into model training often rely on internal model mechanisms, which recent research suggests may be unreliable. Our insight is that many challenges associated with saliency-guided training stem from the placement of the guidance approaches solely within the image space. Instead, we move away from the image space, use the model's latent space embeddings to steer human guidance during training, and we propose SAGE (Saliency-Guided Contrastive Embeddings): a loss function that integrates human saliency into network training using contrastive embeddings. We apply salient-preserving and saliency-degrading signal augmentations to the input and capture the changes in embeddings and model logits. We guide the model towards salient features and away from non-salient features using a contrastive triplet loss. Additionally, we perform a sanity check on the logit distributions to ensure that the model outputs match the saliency-based augmentations. We demonstrate a boost in classification performance across both open- and closed-set scenarios against SOTA saliency-based methods, showing SAGE's effectiveness across various backbones, and include experiments to suggest its wide generalization across tasks.

Conclusion: SSDA是医疗领域高光谱成像的高效解决方案，有望推动医疗HSI应用发展。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) holds great potential for healthcare due to its rich spectral information. However, acquiring HSI data remains costly and technically demanding. Hyperspectral image reconstruction offers a practical solution by recovering HSI data from accessible modalities, such as RGB. While general domain datasets are abundant, the scarcity of human HSI data limits progress in medical applications. To tackle this, we propose SpectralAdapt, a semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) framework that bridges the domain gap between general and human-centered HSI datasets. To fully exploit limited labels and abundant unlabeled data, we enhance spectral reasoning by introducing Spectral Density Masking (SDM), which adaptively masks RGB channels based on their spectral complexity, encouraging recovery of informative regions from complementary cues during consistency training. Furthermore, we introduce Spectral Endmember Representation Alignment (SERA), which derives physically interpretable endmembers from valuable labeled pixels and employs them as domain-invariant anchors to guide unlabeled predictions, with momentum updates ensuring adaptability and stability. These components are seamlessly integrated into SpectralAdapt, a spectral prior-guided framework that effectively mitigates domain shift, spectral degradation, and data scarcity in HSI reconstruction. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in spectral fidelity, cross-domain generalization, and training stability, highlighting the promise of SSDA as an efficient solution for hyperspectral imaging in healthcare.

Abstract: Automatic sign language recognition plays a crucial role in bridging the communication gap between deaf communities and hearing individuals; however, most available datasets focus on American Sign Language. For Romanian Isolated Sign Language Recognition (RoISLR), no large-scale, standardized dataset exists, which limits research progress. In this work, we introduce a new corpus for RoISLR, named RoCoISLR, comprising over 9,000 video samples that span nearly 6,000 standardized glosses from multiple sources. We establish benchmark results by evaluating seven state-of-the-art video recognition models-I3D, SlowFast, Swin Transformer, TimeSformer, Uniformer, VideoMAE, and PoseConv3D-under consistent experimental setups, and compare their performance with that of the widely used WLASL2000 corpus. According to the results, transformer-based architectures outperform convolutional baselines; Swin Transformer achieved a Top-1 accuracy of 34.1%. Our benchmarks highlight the challenges associated with long-tail class distributions in low-resource sign languages, and RoCoISLR provides the initial foundation for systematic RoISLR research.

Abstract: Saliency maps are widely used for visual explanations in deep learning, but a fundamental lack of consensus persists regarding their intended purpose and alignment with diverse user queries. This ambiguity hinders the effective evaluation and practical utility of explanation methods.We address this gap by introducing the Reference-Frame $\times$ Granularity (RFxG) taxonomy, a principled conceptual framework that organizes saliency explanations along two essential axes:Reference-Frame: Distinguishing between pointwise ("Why this prediction?") and contrastive ("Why this and not an alternative?") explanations.Granularity: Ranging from fine-grained class-level (e.g., "Why Husky?") to coarse-grained group-level (e.g., "Why Dog?") interpretations.Using the RFxG lens, we demonstrate critical limitations in existing evaluation metrics, which overwhelmingly prioritize pointwise faithfulness while neglecting contrastive reasoning and semantic granularity. To systematically assess explanation quality across both RFxG dimensions, we propose four novel faithfulness metrics. Our comprehensive evaluation framework applies these metrics to ten state-of-the-art saliency methods, four model architectures, and three datasets.By advocating a shift toward user-intent-driven evaluation, our work provides both the conceptual foundation and the practical tools necessary to develop visual explanations that are not only faithful to the underlying model behavior but are also meaningfully aligned with the complexity of human understanding and inquiry.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tumors is vital for diagnosis, surgical planning, and treatment monitoring. Deep learning has advanced on benchmarks, but two issues limit clinical use: no uncertainty estimates for errors and no segmentation of healthy brain structures around tumors for surgery. Current methods fail to unify tumor localization with anatomical context and lack confidence scores. This study presents an uncertainty-aware framework augmenting nnUNet with a channel for voxel-wise uncertainty. Trained on BraTS2023, it yields a correlation of 0.750 and RMSD of 0.047 for uncertainty without hurting tumor accuracy. It predicts uncertainty in one pass, with no extra networks or inferences, aiding clinical decisions. For whole-brain context, a unified model combines normal and cancer datasets, achieving a DSC of 0.81 for brain structures and 0.86 for tumor, with robust key-region performance. Combining both innovations gives the first model outputting tumor in natural surroundings plus an overlaid uncertainty map. Visual checks of outputs show uncertainty offers key insights to evaluate predictions and fix errors, helping informed surgical decisions from AI.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents have made remarkable progress, but their robustness remains insufficiently studied. Existing adversarial evaluations often rely on perturbations that manifest as unusual textures rarely encountered in everyday indoor environments. Errors under such contrived conditions have limited practical relevance, as real-world agents are unlikely to encounter such artificial patterns. In this work, we focus on indoor lighting, an intrinsic yet largely overlooked scene attribute that strongly influences navigation. We propose Indoor Lighting-based Adversarial Attack (ILA), a black-box framework that manipulates global illumination to disrupt VLN agents. Motivated by typical household lighting usage, we design two attack modes: Static Indoor Lighting-based Attack (SILA), where the lighting intensity remains constant throughout an episode, and Dynamic Indoor Lighting-based Attack (DILA), where lights are switched on or off at critical moments to induce abrupt illumination changes. We evaluate ILA on two state-of-the-art VLN models across three navigation tasks. Results show that ILA significantly increases failure rates while reducing trajectory efficiency, revealing previously unrecognized vulnerabilities of VLN agents to realistic indoor lighting variations.

Abstract: The American Society of Civil Engineers has graded Americas infrastructure condition as a C, with the road system receiving a dismal D. Roads are vital to regional economic viability, yet their management, maintenance, and repair processes remain inefficient, relying on outdated manual or laser-based inspection methods that are both costly and time-consuming. With the increasing availability of real-time visual data from autonomous vehicles, there is an opportunity to apply computer vision (CV) methods for advanced road monitoring, providing insights to guide infrastructure rehabilitation efforts. This project explores the use of state-of-the-art CV techniques for road distress segmentation. It begins by evaluating synthetic data generated with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to assess its usefulness for model training. The study then applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for road distress segmentation and subsequently examines the transformer-based model MaskFormer. Results show that GAN-generated data improves model performance and that MaskFormer outperforms the CNN model in two metrics: mAP50 and IoU.

TL;DR: SOMA是一个SAR与光学图像密集配准框架，通过集成结构梯度先验和混合匹配策略，显著提升了配准精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR和光学图像由于成像机制和视觉特征的根本差异，像素级配准仍然具有挑战性。虽然深度学习在许多跨模态任务中取得成功，但在SAR-光学配准任务中表现仍不理想，梯度信息在深度学习框架中未被有效利用。

Method: 提出SOMA框架：1）特征梯度增强器（FGE），通过注意力和重建机制将多尺度、多方向梯度滤波器嵌入特征空间；2）全局-局部仿射流匹配器（GLAM），在粗到细架构中结合仿射变换和基于流的细化。

Result: 在SEN1-2数据集上CMR@1px提高12.29%，在GFGE_SO数据集上提高18.50%，表现出强大的鲁棒性，在不同场景和分辨率下泛化良好。

Conclusion: SOMA通过有效利用梯度信息和混合匹配策略，显著提升了SAR-光学图像配准性能，为解决这一挑战性任务提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Achieving pixel-level registration between SAR and optical images remains a challenging task due to their fundamentally different imaging mechanisms and visual characteristics. Although deep learning has achieved great success in many cross-modal tasks, its performance on SAR-Optical registration tasks is still unsatisfactory. Gradient-based information has traditionally played a crucial role in handcrafted descriptors by highlighting structural differences. However, such gradient cues have not been effectively leveraged in deep learning frameworks for SAR-Optical image matching. To address this gap, we propose SOMA, a dense registration framework that integrates structural gradient priors into deep features and refines alignment through a hybrid matching strategy. Specifically, we introduce the Feature Gradient Enhancer (FGE), which embeds multi-scale, multi-directional gradient filters into the feature space using attention and reconstruction mechanisms to boost feature distinctiveness. Furthermore, we propose the Global-Local Affine-Flow Matcher (GLAM), which combines affine transformation and flow-based refinement within a coarse-to-fine architecture to ensure both structural consistency and local accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that SOMA significantly improves registration precision, increasing the CMR@1px by 12.29% on the SEN1-2 dataset and 18.50% on the GFGE_SO dataset. In addition, SOMA exhibits strong robustness and generalizes well across diverse scenes and resolutions.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, however their knowledge and abilities in the cross-view geo-localization and pose estimation domains remain unexplored, despite potential benefits for navigation, autonomous driving, outdoor robotics, \textit{etc}. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{GeoX-Bench}, a comprehensive \underline{Bench}mark designed to explore and evaluate the capabilities of LMMs in \underline{cross}-view \underline{Geo}-localization and pose estimation. Specifically, GeoX-Bench contains 10,859 panoramic-satellite image pairs spanning 128 cities in 49 countries, along with corresponding 755,976 question-answering (QA) pairs. Among these, 42,900 QA pairs are designated for benchmarking, while the remaining are intended to enhance the capabilities of LMMs. Based on GeoX-Bench, we evaluate the capabilities of 25 state-of-the-art LMMs on cross-view geo-localization and pose estimation tasks, and further explore the empowered capabilities of instruction-tuning. Our benchmark demonstrate that while current LMMs achieve impressive performance in geo-localization tasks, their effectiveness declines significantly on the more complex pose estimation tasks, highlighting a critical area for future improvement, and instruction-tuning LMMs on the training data of GeoX-Bench can significantly improve the cross-view geo-sense abilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ViCoKD框架，通过跨模态知识蒸馏解决部分重叠多视图动作识别问题，使模态受限的学生模型能够利用多模态相关性，并通过视图一致性模块处理视图不对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多传感器系统中，部分重叠设置（动作仅在部分视图中可见）研究不足，且现实场景中通常只有有限输入模态和序列级标注，而非密集帧级标签。

Method: ViCoKD框架：1）跨模态适配器使用跨模态注意力让学生模型利用多模态相关性；2）视图一致性模块通过人类检测掩码和置信度加权的Jensen-Shannon散度强制共可见动作的预测对齐。

Result: 在真实世界MultiSensor-Home数据集上的实验表明，ViCoKD在多个骨干网络和环境中始终优于竞争性蒸馏方法，在有限条件下实现显著提升并超越教师模型。

Conclusion: ViCoKD有效解决了部分重叠多视图动作识别中的模态限制和视图不对齐问题，为现实场景中的多模态动作识别提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The widespread use of multi-sensor systems has increased research in multi-view action recognition. While existing approaches in multi-view setups with fully overlapping sensors benefit from consistent view coverage, partially overlapping settings where actions are visible in only a subset of views remain underexplored. This challenge becomes more severe in real-world scenarios, as many systems provide only limited input modalities and rely on sequence-level annotations instead of dense frame-level labels. In this study, we propose View-aware Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (ViCoKD), a framework that distills knowledge from a fully supervised multi-modal teacher to a modality- and annotation-limited student. ViCoKD employs a cross-modal adapter with cross-modal attention, allowing the student to exploit multi-modal correlations while operating with incomplete modalities. Moreover, we propose a View-aware Consistency module to address view misalignment, where the same action may appear differently or only partially across viewpoints. It enforces prediction alignment when the action is co-visible across views, guided by human-detection masks and confidence-weighted Jensen-Shannon divergence between their predicted class distributions. Experiments on the real-world MultiSensor-Home dataset show that ViCoKD consistently outperforms competitive distillation methods across multiple backbones and environments, delivering significant gains and surpassing the teacher model under limited conditions.

Abstract: Group activity detection in multi-person scenes is challenging due to complex human interactions, occlusions, and variations in appearance over time. This work presents a computer vision based framework for group activity recognition and action spotting using a combination of deep learning models and graph based relational reasoning. The system first applies Mask R-CNN to obtain accurate actor localization through bounding boxes and instance masks. Multiple backbone networks, including Inception V3, MobileNet, and VGG16, are used to extract feature maps, and RoIAlign is applied to preserve spatial alignment when generating actor specific features. The mask information is then fused with the feature maps to obtain refined masked feature representations for each actor. To model interactions between individuals, we construct Actor Relation Graphs that encode appearance similarity and positional relations using methods such as normalized cross correlation, sum of absolute differences, and dot product. Graph Convolutional Networks operate on these graphs to reason about relationships and predict both individual actions and group level activities. Experiments on the Collective Activity dataset demonstrate that the combination of mask based feature refinement, robust similarity search, and graph neural network reasoning leads to improved recognition performance across both crowded and non crowded scenarios. This approach highlights the potential of integrating segmentation, feature extraction, and relational graph reasoning for complex video understanding tasks.

Abstract: Analyzing hand-object interaction in egocentric vision facilitates VR/AR applications and human-robot policy transfer. Existing research has mostly focused on modeling the behavior paradigm of interactive actions (i.e., "how to interact"). However, the more challenging and fine-grained problem of capturing the critical moments of contact and separation between the hand and the target object (i.e., "when to interact") is still underexplored, which is crucial for immersive interactive experiences in mixed reality and robotic motion planning. Therefore, we formulate this problem as temporal interaction localization (TIL). Some recent works extract semantic masks as TIL references, but suffer from inaccurate object grounding and cluttered scenarios. Although current temporal action localization (TAL) methods perform well in detecting verb-noun action segments, they rely on category annotations during training and exhibit limited precision in localizing hand-object contact/separation moments. To address these issues, we propose a novel zero-shot approach dubbed EgoLoc to localize hand-object contact and separation timestamps in egocentric videos. EgoLoc introduces hand-dynamics-guided sampling to generate high-quality visual prompts. It exploits the vision-language model to identify contact/separation attributes, localize specific timestamps, and provide closed-loop feedback for further refinement. EgoLoc eliminates the need for object masks and verb-noun taxonomies, leading to generalizable zero-shot implementation. Comprehensive experiments on the public dataset and our novel benchmarks demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves plausible TIL for egocentric videos. It is also validated to effectively facilitate multiple downstream applications in egocentric vision and robotic manipulation tasks. Code and relevant data will be released at https://github.com/IRMVLab/EgoLoc.

Conclusion: 该框架实现了自动、可解释的绘画创造力评估，代码和标注将公开。

Abstract: Assessing human creativity through visual outputs, such as drawings, plays a critical role in fields including psychology, education, and cognitive science. However, current assessment practices still rely heavily on expert-based subjective scoring, which is both labor-intensive and inherently subjective. In this paper, we propose a data-driven framework for automatic and interpretable creativity assessment from drawings. Motivated by the cognitive understanding that creativity can emerge from both what is drawn (content) and how it is drawn (style), we reinterpret the creativity score as a function of these two complementary dimensions.Specifically, we first augment an existing creativity labeled dataset with additional annotations targeting content categories. Based on the enriched dataset, we further propose a multi-modal, multi-task learning framework that simultaneously predicts creativity scores, categorizes content types, and extracts stylistic features. In particular, we introduce a conditional learning mechanism that enables the model to adapt its visual feature extraction by dynamically tuning it to creativity-relevant signals conditioned on the drawing's stylistic and semantic cues.Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing regression-based approaches and offers interpretable visualizations that align well with human judgments. The code and annotations will be made publicly available at https://github.com/WonderOfU9/CSCA_PRCV_2025

Conclusion: 半监督方法不仅提高了整体质量评估性能，还提供了关于采集条件（光照、清晰度、对比度）的可解释反馈，增强了可解释性且无需额外标注成本。

Abstract: Retinal image quality assessment (RIQA) supports computer-aided diagnosis of eye diseases. However, most tools classify only overall image quality, without indicating acquisition defects to guide recapture. This gap is mainly due to the high cost of detailed annotations. In this paper, we aim to mitigate this limitation by introducing a hybrid semi-supervised learning approach that combines manual labels for overall quality with pseudo-labels of quality details within a multi-task framework. Our objective is to obtain more interpretable RIQA models without requiring extensive manual labeling. Pseudo-labels are generated by a Teacher model trained on a small dataset and then used to fine-tune a pre-trained model in a multi-task setting. Using a ResNet-18 backbone, we show that these weak annotations improve quality assessment over single-task baselines (F1: 0.875 vs. 0.863 on EyeQ, and 0.778 vs. 0.763 on DeepDRiD), matching or surpassing existing methods. The multi-task model achieved performance statistically comparable to the Teacher for most detail prediction tasks (p > 0.05). In a newly annotated EyeQ subset released with this paper, our model performed similarly to experts, suggesting that pseudo-label noise aligns with expert variability. Our main finding is that the proposed semi-supervised approach not only improves overall quality assessment but also provides interpretable feedback on capture conditions (illumination, clarity, contrast). This enhances interpretability at no extra manual labeling cost and offers clinically actionable outputs to guide image recapture.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的静态剪枝方法通过永久移除权重或token来降低VAR模型的计算成本，但会破坏预训练依赖关系并导致性能下降。需要一种能够在不牺牲模型容量的情况下提升效率的动态方法。

Method: ActVAR将前馈网络分解为轻量级专家子网络，使用可学习路由器基于内容动态选择token特定的专家子集。同时采用门控token选择器识别高更新潜力的token，并重构未选中的token以保持全局上下文和序列对齐。训练采用两阶段知识蒸馏策略，原始VAR模型监督路由和门控策略的学习。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256基准测试中，ActVAR实现了高达21.2%的FLOPs减少，同时性能下降最小。

Conclusion: ActVAR通过动态激活框架有效解决了VAR模型计算成本随序列长度增长的问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升了效率，为大规模视觉自回归模型的实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models enable efficient image generation via next-scale prediction but face escalating computational costs as sequence length grows. Existing static pruning methods degrade performance by permanently removing weights or tokens, disrupting pretrained dependencies. To address this, we propose ActVAR, a dynamic activation framework that introduces dual sparsity across model weights and token sequences to enhance efficiency without sacrificing capacity. ActVAR decomposes feedforward networks (FFNs) into lightweight expert sub-networks and employs a learnable router to dynamically select token-specific expert subsets based on content. Simultaneously, a gated token selector identifies high-update-potential tokens for computation while reconstructing unselected tokens to preserve global context and sequence alignment. Training employs a two-stage knowledge distillation strategy, where the original VAR model supervises the learning of routing and gating policies to align with pretrained knowledge. Experiments on the ImageNet $256\times 256$ benchmark demonstrate that ActVAR achieves up to $21.2\%$ FLOPs reduction with minimal performance degradation.

Motivation: 专业数字媒体制作需要HDR成像，但现有3D重建主要基于LDR数据，限制了在专业工作流程中的应用。传统方法依赖多曝光融合或逆色调映射，增加了捕获复杂性。

Method: 提出Native High dynamic range 3D Gaussian Splatting (NH-3DGS)，采用亮度-色度分解的颜色表示方法，直接从原生HDR相机数据进行优化。

Result: 在合成和真实多视角HDR数据集上，NH-3DGS在重建质量和动态范围保持方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了直接从原生HDR捕获进行专业级3D重建，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging is essential for professional digital media creation, e.g., filmmaking, virtual production, and photorealistic rendering. However, 3D scene reconstruction has primarily focused on Low Dynamic Range (LDR) data, limiting its applicability to professional workflows. Existing approaches that reconstruct HDR scenes from LDR observations rely on multi-exposure fusion or inverse tone-mapping, which increase capture complexity and depend on synthetic supervision. With the recent emergence of cameras that directly capture native HDR data in a single exposure, we present the first method for 3D scene reconstruction that directly models native HDR observations. We propose {\bf Native High dynamic range 3D Gaussian Splatting (NH-3DGS)}, which preserves the full dynamic range throughout the reconstruction pipeline. Our key technical contribution is a novel luminance-chromaticity decomposition of the color representation that enables direct optimization from native HDR camera data. We demonstrate on both synthetic and real multi-view HDR datasets that NH-3DGS significantly outperforms existing methods in reconstruction quality and dynamic range preservation, enabling professional-grade 3D reconstruction directly from native HDR captures. Code and datasets will be made available.

Conclusion: gDDCM有效扩展了DDCM的应用范围，使其能够适用于主流扩散模型及其变体，在图像压缩任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Recently, the Denoising Diffusion Codebook Models (DDCM) was proposed. DDCM leverages the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) and replaces the random noise in the backward process with noise sampled from specific sets according to a predefined rule, thereby enabling image compression. However, DDCM cannot be applied to methods other than DDPM. In this paper, we propose the generalized Denoising Diffusion Compression Model (gDDCM), which extends DDCM to mainstream diffusion models and their variants, including DDPM, Score-Based Models, Consistency Models, and Rectified Flow. We evaluate our method on CIFAR-10 and LSUN Bedroom datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach successfully generalizes DDCM to the aforementioned models and achieves improved performance.

Abstract: Due to the diversity of brain anatomy and the scarcity of annotated data, supervised anomaly detection for brain MRI remains challenging, driving the development of unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) approaches. Current UAD methods typically utilize artificially generated noise perturbations on healthy MRIs to train generative models for normal anatomy reconstruction, enabling anomaly detection via residual mapping. However, such simulated anomalies lack the biophysical fidelity and morphological complexity characteristic of true clinical lesions. To advance UAD in brain MRI, we conduct the first systematic frequency-domain analysis of pathological signatures, revealing two key properties: (1) anomalies exhibit unique frequency patterns distinguishable from normal anatomy, and (2) low-frequency signals maintain consistent representations across healthy scans. These insights motivate our Frequency-Decomposition Preprocessing (FDP) framework, the first UAD method to leverage frequency-domain reconstruction for simultaneous pathology suppression and anatomical preservation. FDP can integrate seamlessly with existing anomaly simulation techniques, consistently enhancing detection performance across diverse architectures while maintaining diagnostic fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that FDP consistently improves anomaly detection performance when integrated with existing methods. Notably, FDP achieves a 17.63% increase in DICE score with LDM while maintaining robust improvements across multiple baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/ls1rius/MRI_FDP.

Abstract: The remarkable progress of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on a variety of tasks has raised interest in their application to automated driving. However, for these models to be trusted in such a safety-critical domain, they must first possess robust perception capabilities, i.e., they must be capable of understanding a traffic scene, which can often be highly complex, with many things happening simultaneously. Moreover, since critical objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at long distances, we require systems with not only strong perception capabilities at close distances (up to 20 meters), but also at long (30+ meters) range. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the perception capabilities of these models in isolation from other skills like reasoning or advanced world knowledge. Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question Answering (DTPQA) is a Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark designed specifically for this purpose: it can be used to evaluate the perception systems of VLMs in traffic scenarios using trivial yet crucial questions relevant to driving decisions. It consists of two parts: a synthetic benchmark (DTP-Synthetic) created using a simulator, and a real-world benchmark (DTP-Real) built on top of existing images of real traffic scenes. Additionally, DTPQA includes distance annotations, i.e., how far the object in question is from the camera. More specifically, each DTPQA sample consists of (at least): (a) an image, (b) a question, (c) the ground truth answer, and (d) the distance of the object in question, enabling analysis of how VLM performance degrades with increasing object distance. In this article, we provide the dataset itself along with the Python scripts used to create it, which can be used to generate additional data of the same kind.

TL;DR: TripleFDS是一个用于场景文本编辑的新框架，通过解耦文本样式、文本内容和背景三个属性，实现了更灵活和视觉一致的文本编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的场景文本编辑方法通常只能编辑文本内容，无法完全解耦可编辑属性，限制了可控性和视觉一致性。

Method: 提出TripleFDS框架和SCB Synthesis数据集，使用SCB Group作为基本训练单元，通过组间对比正则化和组内多特征正交性实现三重特征解耦，在合成阶段进行特征重映射以防止重建中的"捷径"现象。

Result: 在主流STE基准测试中，TripleFDS实现了最先进的图像保真度（SSIM为44.54）和文本准确率（ACC为93.58%）。

Conclusion: TripleFDS不仅性能优越，还支持样式替换和背景转移等新操作，为场景文本编辑提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Scene Text Editing (STE) aims to naturally modify text in images while preserving visual consistency, the decisive factors of which can be divided into three parts, i.e., text style, text content, and background. Previous methods have struggled with incomplete disentanglement of editable attributes, typically addressing only one aspect - such as editing text content - thus limiting controllability and visual consistency. To overcome these limitations, we propose TripleFDS, a novel framework for STE with disentangled modular attributes, and an accompanying dataset called SCB Synthesis. SCB Synthesis provides robust training data for triple feature disentanglement by utilizing the "SCB Group", a novel construct that combines three attributes per image to generate diverse, disentangled training groups. Leveraging this construct as a basic training unit, TripleFDS first disentangles triple features, ensuring semantic accuracy through inter-group contrastive regularization and reducing redundancy through intra-sample multi-feature orthogonality. In the synthesis phase, TripleFDS performs feature remapping to prevent "shortcut" phenomena during reconstruction and mitigate potential feature leakage. Trained on 125,000 SCB Groups, TripleFDS achieves state-of-the-art image fidelity (SSIM of 44.54) and text accuracy (ACC of 93.58%) on the mainstream STE benchmarks. Besides superior performance, the more flexible editing of TripleFDS supports new operations such as style replacement and background transfer. Code: https://github.com/yusenbao01/TripleFDS

Abstract: Deep learning-based 3D anomaly detection methods have demonstrated significant potential in industrial manufacturing. However, many approaches are specifically designed for anomaly detection tasks, which limits their generalizability to other 3D understanding tasks. In contrast, self-supervised point cloud models aim for general-purpose representation learning, yet our investigation reveals that these classical models are suboptimal at anomaly detection under the unified fine-tuning paradigm. This motivates us to develop a more generalizable 3D model that can effectively detect anomalies without relying on task-specific designs. Interestingly, we find that using only the curvature of each point as its anomaly score already outperforms several classical self-supervised and dedicated anomaly detection models, highlighting the critical role of curvature in 3D anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose a Curvature-Augmented Self-supervised Learning (CASL) framework based on a reconstruction paradigm. Built upon the classical U-Net architecture, our approach introduces multi-scale curvature prompts to guide the decoder in predicting the spatial coordinates of each point. Without relying on any dedicated anomaly detection mechanisms, it achieves leading detection performance through straightforward anomaly classification fine-tuning. Moreover, the learned representations generalize well to standard 3D understanding tasks such as point cloud classification. The code is available at https://github.com/zyh16143998882/CASL.

Conclusion: Foresee成功证明了无需训练的MLLM在图像伪造分析中的有效性，实现了优越的定位性能和全面的解释能力，具有强大的泛化性。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) technologies, including multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and diffusion models, image generation and manipulation have become remarkably effortless. Existing image forgery detection and localization (IFDL) methods often struggle to generalize across diverse datasets and offer limited interpretability. Nowadays, MLLMs demonstrate strong generalization potential across diverse vision-language tasks, and some studies introduce this capability to IFDL via large-scale training. However, such approaches cost considerable computational resources, while failing to reveal the inherent generalization potential of vanilla MLLMs to address this problem. Inspired by this observation, we propose Foresee, a training-free MLLM-based pipeline tailored for image forgery analysis. It eliminates the need for additional training and enables a lightweight inference process, while surpassing existing MLLM-based methods in both tamper localization accuracy and the richness of textual explanations. Foresee employs a type-prior-driven strategy and utilizes a Flexible Feature Detector (FFD) module to specifically handle copy-move manipulations, thereby effectively unleashing the potential of vanilla MLLMs in the forensic domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach simultaneously achieves superior localization accuracy and provides more comprehensive textual explanations. Moreover, Foresee exhibits stronger generalization capability, outperforming existing IFDL methods across various tampering types, including copy-move, splicing, removal, local enhancement, deepfake, and AIGC-based editing. The code will be released in the final version.

Conclusion: 通过注入定制化噪声有效抑制不相关语义成分，显著改善跨模态表示对齐并提升下游任务性能

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have played an increasingly important role in multimodal intelligence. However, the existing fine-tuning methods often ignore cross-modal heterogeneity, limiting their full potential. In this work, we propose a novel fine-tuning strategy by injecting beneficial random noise, which outperforms previous methods and even surpasses full fine-tuning, with minimal additional parameters. The proposed Multimodal Noise Generator (MuNG) enables efficient modality fine-tuning by injecting customized noise into the frozen MLLMs. Specifically, we reformulate the reasoning process of MLLMs from a variational inference perspective, upon which we design a multimodal noise generator that dynamically analyzes cross-modal relationships in image-text pairs to generate task-adaptive beneficial noise. Injecting this type of noise into the MLLMs effectively suppresses irrelevant semantic components, leading to significantly improved cross-modal representation alignment and enhanced performance on downstream tasks. Experiments on two mainstream MLLMs, QwenVL and LLaVA, demonstrate that our method surpasses full-parameter fine-tuning and other existing fine-tuning approaches, while requiring adjustments to only about $1\sim2\%$ additional parameters.

TL;DR: SliDer是一个使用视觉语言模型将幻灯片图像转换为可编辑SVG格式的语义文档反渲染框架，通过迭代优化生成紧凑且结构化的矢量表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的几何栅格-矢量转换方法在处理复杂文档时无法保持高级结构，导致文本和图像元素的语义区分丢失，限制了文档的编辑性。

Method: 使用视觉语言模型检测和提取栅格输入中的图像和文本元素属性，通过迭代推理过程将其组织成连贯的SVG格式，模拟人类设计过程。

Result: SliDer实现了0.069的重建LPIPS分数，在82.9%的情况下被人类评估者认为优于最强的零样本VLM基线。

Conclusion: SliDer能够有效恢复幻灯片文档的可编辑性，为语义文档反渲染提供了新的解决方案，并贡献了Slide2SVG数据集促进未来研究。

Abstract: Multimedia documents such as slide presentations and posters are designed to be interactive and easy to modify. Yet, they are often distributed in a static raster format, which limits editing and customization. Restoring their editability requires converting these raster images back into structured vector formats. However, existing geometric raster-vectorization methods, which rely on low-level primitives like curves and polygons, fall short at this task. Specifically, when applied to complex documents like slides, they fail to preserve the high-level structure, resulting in a flat collection of shapes where the semantic distinction between image and text elements is lost. To overcome this limitation, we address the problem of semantic document derendering by introducing SliDer, a novel framework that uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to derender slide images as compact and editable Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) representations. SliDer detects and extracts attributes from individual image and text elements in a raster input and organizes them into a coherent SVG format. Crucially, the model iteratively refines its predictions during inference in a process analogous to human design, generating SVG code that more faithfully reconstructs the original raster upon rendering. Furthermore, we introduce Slide2SVG, a novel dataset comprising raster-SVG pairs of slide documents curated from real-world scientific presentations, to facilitate future research in this domain. Our results demonstrate that SliDer achieves a reconstruction LPIPS of 0.069 and is favored by human evaluators in 82.9% of cases compared to the strongest zero-shot VLM baseline.

Conclusion: CoordAR通过自回归概率建模有效解决了单参考6D姿态估计中的全局一致性和不确定性建模问题，为未见物体的姿态估计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Object 6D pose estimation, a crucial task for robotics and augmented reality applications, becomes particularly challenging when dealing with novel objects whose 3D models are not readily available. To reduce dependency on 3D models, recent studies have explored one-reference-based pose estimation, which requires only a single reference view instead of a complete 3D model. However, existing methods that rely on real-valued coordinate regression suffer from limited global consistency due to the local nature of convolutional architectures and face challenges in symmetric or occluded scenarios owing to a lack of uncertainty modeling. We present CoordAR, a novel autoregressive framework for one-reference 6D pose estimation of unseen objects. CoordAR formulates 3D-3D correspondences between the reference and query views as a map of discrete tokens, which is obtained in an autoregressive and probabilistic manner. To enable accurate correspondence regression, CoordAR introduces 1) a novel coordinate map tokenization that enables probabilistic prediction over discretized 3D space; 2) a modality-decoupled encoding strategy that separately encodes RGB appearance and coordinate cues; and 3) an autoregressive transformer decoder conditioned on both position-aligned query features and the partially generated token sequence. With these novel mechanisms, CoordAR significantly outperforms existing methods on multiple benchmarks and demonstrates strong robustness to symmetry, occlusion, and other challenges in real-world tests.

Motivation: 现有生成视频模型大多仅限于相机运动控制，难以控制景深、曝光等摄影元素，而这些元素对电影叙事至关重要。

Method: 提出解耦交叉注意力机制分离相机运动和摄影输入；开发综合数据生成策略，结合模拟摄影效果和真实世界采集管道构建大规模数据集。

Result: 模型能够生成高保真视频，精确控制用户指定的摄影相机效果。

Conclusion: CineCtrl是首个提供专业相机参数精细控制的视频电影编辑框架，解决了现有方法在摄影效果控制方面的局限性。

Abstract: Cinematic storytelling is profoundly shaped by the artful manipulation of photographic elements such as depth of field and exposure. These effects are crucial in conveying mood and creating aesthetic appeal. However, controlling these effects in generative video models remains highly challenging, as most existing methods are restricted to camera motion control. In this paper, we propose CineCtrl, the first video cinematic editing framework that provides fine control over professional camera parameters (e.g., bokeh, shutter speed). We introduce a decoupled cross-attention mechanism to disentangle camera motion from photographic inputs, allowing fine-grained, independent control without compromising scene consistency. To overcome the shortage of training data, we develop a comprehensive data generation strategy that leverages simulated photographic effects with a dedicated real-world collection pipeline, enabling the construction of a large-scale dataset for robust model training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model generates high-fidelity videos with precisely controlled, user-specified photographic camera effects.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The advent of multimodal deep learning models, such as CLIP, has unlocked new frontiers in a wide range of applications, from image-text understanding to classification tasks. However, these models are not safe for adversarial attacks, particularly backdoor attacks, which can subtly manipulate model behavior. Moreover, existing defense methods typically involve training from scratch or fine-tuning using a large dataset without pinpointing the specific labels that are affected. In this study, we introduce an innovative strategy to enhance the robustness of multimodal contrastive learning models against such attacks. In particular, given a poisoned CLIP model, our approach can identify the backdoor trigger and pinpoint the victim samples and labels in an efficient manner. To that end, an image segmentation ``oracle'' is introduced as the supervisor for the output of the poisoned CLIP. We develop two algorithms to rectify the poisoned model: (1) differentiating between CLIP and Oracle's knowledge to identify potential triggers; (2) pinpointing affected labels and victim samples, and curating a compact fine-tuning dataset. With this knowledge, we are allowed to rectify the poisoned CLIP model to negate backdoor effects. Extensive experiments on visual recognition benchmarks demonstrate our strategy is effective in CLIP-based backdoor defense.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of intelligent transportation systems, text-driven image generation and editing techniques have demonstrated significant potential in providing rich, controllable visual scene data for applications such as traffic monitoring and autonomous driving. However, several challenges remain, including insufficient semantic richness of generated traffic elements, limited camera viewpoints, low visual fidelity of synthesized images, and poor alignment between textual descriptions and generated content. To address these issues, we propose a unified text-driven framework for both image generation and editing, leveraging a controllable mask mechanism to seamlessly integrate the two tasks. Furthermore, we incorporate both vehicle-side and roadside multi-view data to enhance the geometric diversity of traffic scenes. Our training strategy follows a two-stage paradigm: first, we perform conceptual learning using large-scale coarse-grained text-image data; then, we fine-tune with fine-grained descriptive data to enhance text-image alignment and detail quality. Additionally, we introduce a mask-region-weighted loss that dynamically emphasizes small yet critical regions during training, thereby substantially enhancing the generation fidelity of small-scale traffic elements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves leading performance in text-based image generation and editing within traffic scenes.

Motivation: 现有的行人重识别方法通常将I2I和T2I任务分开处理，这可能导致表示纠缠和性能不佳。两种任务共享检索目标但面临不同挑战：I2I强调判别性身份学习，T2I需要准确的跨模态语义对齐。

Method: 1) 任务路由Transformer：在共享视觉编码器中引入双分类令牌，分别路由I2I和T2I分支的特征；2) 分层提示生成：整合身份级可学习令牌和实例级伪文本令牌；3) 跨模态提示正则化：在提示令牌空间中强制语义对齐。

Result: 在多个行人重识别基准测试上的广泛实验验证了该方法的有效性，在I2I和T2I任务上都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: HPL框架通过统一处理I2I和T2I任务，解决了表示纠缠问题，实现了两个任务的联合优化和性能提升。

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) aims to retrieve target pedestrian images given either visual queries (image-to-image, I2I) or textual descriptions (text-to-image, T2I). Although both tasks share a common retrieval objective, they pose distinct challenges: I2I emphasizes discriminative identity learning, while T2I requires accurate cross-modal semantic alignment. Existing methods often treat these tasks separately, which may lead to representation entanglement and suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a unified framework named Hierarchical Prompt Learning (HPL), which leverages task-aware prompt modeling to jointly optimize both tasks. Specifically, we first introduce a Task-Routed Transformer, which incorporates dual classification tokens into a shared visual encoder to route features for I2I and T2I branches respectively. On top of this, we develop a hierarchical prompt generation scheme that integrates identity-level learnable tokens with instance-level pseudo-text tokens. These pseudo-tokens are derived from image or text features via modality-specific inversion networks, injecting fine-grained, instance-specific semantics into the prompts. Furthermore, we propose a Cross-Modal Prompt Regularization strategy to enforce semantic alignment in the prompt token space, ensuring that pseudo-prompts preserve source-modality characteristics while enhancing cross-modal transferability. Extensive experiments on multiple ReID benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both I2I and T2I tasks.

Motivation: 视觉自回归模型的next-token-prediction范式引入显著推理延迟，传统推测解码的"一步起草、一步验证"模式无法直接减少前向传递次数，限制了加速潜力。

Method: 基于视觉令牌可互换性，提出VVS框架，包含三个模块：动态截断的验证无关令牌选择器、令牌级特征缓存与重用、细粒度跳过步调度。

Result: VVS将目标模型前向传递次数减少2.8倍，同时保持有竞争力的生成质量，在速度-质量权衡上优于传统推测解码框架。

Conclusion: VVS通过部分验证跳过显式减少推理延迟，具有重塑推测解码范式的强大潜力。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive (AR) generation models have demonstrated strong potential for image generation, yet their next-token-prediction paradigm introduces considerable inference latency. Although speculative decoding (SD) has been proven effective for accelerating visual AR models, its "draft one step, then verify one step" paradigm prevents a direct reduction of the forward passes, thus restricting acceleration potential. Motivated by the visual token interchangeability, we for the first time to explore verification skipping in the SD process of visual AR model generation to explicitly cut the number of target model forward passes, thereby reducing inference latency. Based on an analysis of the drafting stage's characteristics, we observe that verification redundancy and stale feature reusability are key factors to retain generation quality and speedup for verification-free steps. Inspired by these two observations, we propose a novel SD framework VVS to accelerate visual AR generation via partial verification skipping, which integrates three complementary modules: (1) a verification-free token selector with dynamical truncation, (2) token-level feature caching and reuse, and (3) fine-grained skipped step scheduling. Consequently, VVS reduces the number of target model forward passes by a factor of $2.8\times$ relative to vanilla AR decoding while maintaining competitive generation quality, offering a superior speed-quality trade-off over conventional SD frameworks and revealing strong potential to reshape the SD paradigm.

Conclusion: ProtoAnomalyNCD通过结合对象定位和异常图引导注意力，有效解决了工业异常检测中多类型异常发现和分类的挑战。

Abstract: Existing industrial anomaly detection methods mainly determine whether an anomaly is present. However, real-world applications also require discovering and classifying multiple anomaly types. Since industrial anomalies are semantically subtle and current methods do not sufficiently exploit image priors, direct clustering approaches often perform poorly. To address these challenges, we propose ProtoAnomalyNCD, a prototype-learning-based framework for discovering unseen anomaly classes of multiple types that can be integrated with various anomaly detection methods. First, to suppress background clutter, we leverage Grounded SAM with text prompts to localize object regions as priors for the anomaly classification network. Next, because anomalies usually appear as subtle and fine-grained patterns on the product, we introduce an Anomaly-Map-Guided Attention block. Within this block, we design a Region Guidance Factor that helps the attention module distinguish among background, object regions, and anomalous regions. By using both localized product regions and anomaly maps as priors, the module enhances anomalous features while suppressing background noise and preserving normal features for contrastive learning. Finally, under a unified prototype-learning framework, ProtoAnomalyNCD discovers and clusters unseen anomaly classes while simultaneously enabling multi-type anomaly classification. We further extend our method to detect unseen outliers, achieving task-level unification. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the MVTec AD, MTD, and Real-IAD datasets.

Abstract: Reconstructing high dynamic range (HDR) images from low dynamic range (LDR) bursts plays an essential role in the computational photography. Impressive progress has been achieved by learning-based algorithms which require LDR-HDR image pairs. However, these pairs are hard to obtain, which motivates researchers to delve into the problem of annotation-efficient HDR image reconstructing: how to achieve comparable performance with limited HDR ground truths (GTs). This work attempts to address this problem from the view of semi-supervised learning where a teacher model generates pseudo HDR GTs for the LDR samples without GTs and a student model learns from pseudo GTs. Nevertheless, the confirmation bias, i.e., the student may learn from the artifacts in pseudo HDR GTs, presents an impediment. To remove this impediment, an uncertainty-based masking process is proposed to discard unreliable parts of pseudo GTs at both pixel and patch levels, then the trusted areas can be learned from by the student. With this novel masking process, our semi-supervised HDR reconstructing method not only outperforms previous annotation-efficient algorithms, but also achieves comparable performance with up-to-date fully-supervised methods by using only 6.7% HDR GTs.

Abstract: Performance in face and speaker verification is largely driven by margin based softmax losses like CosFace and ArcFace. Recently introduced $α$-divergence loss functions offer a compelling alternative, particularly for their ability to induce sparse solutions (when $α>1$). However, integrating an angular margin-crucial for verification tasks-is not straightforward. We find this integration can be achieved in at least two distinct ways: via the reference measure (prior probabilities) or via the logits (unnormalized log-likelihoods). In this paper, we explore both pathways, deriving two novel margin-based $α$-divergence losses: Q-Margin (margin in the reference measure) and A3M (margin in the logits). We identify and address a critical training instability in A3M-caused by the interplay of penalized logits and sparsity-with a simple yet effective prototype re-initialization strategy. Our methods achieve significant performance gains on the challenging IJB-B and IJB-C face verification benchmarks. We demonstrate similarly strong performance in speaker verification on VoxCeleb. Crucially, our models significantly outperform strong baselines at low false acceptance rates (FAR). This capability is crucial for practical high-security applications, such as banking authentication, when minimizing false authentications is paramount.

Motivation: 现有视频扩散模型在生成长视频时，由于缺乏有效的记忆压缩和检索机制，在窗口大小之外会出现遗忘和时空不一致的问题。

Method: 提出RAD框架，在扩散变换器中引入LSTM，采用帧级自回归进行记忆更新和检索，确保训练和推理的一致性。

Result: 在Memory Maze和Minecraft数据集上的实验表明，RAD在长视频生成方面优于现有方法，LSTM在序列建模中表现出高效性。

Conclusion: RAD框架通过集成LSTM有效解决了长视频生成中的记忆问题，为基于扩散模型的世界建模提供了改进方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have demonstrated the potential of using video diffusion models as world models, with autoregressive generation of infinitely long videos through masked conditioning. However, such models, usually with local full attention, lack effective memory compression and retrieval for long-term generation beyond the window size, leading to issues of forgetting and spatiotemporal inconsistencies. To enhance the retention of historical information within a fixed memory budget, we introduce a recurrent neural network (RNN) into the diffusion transformer framework. Specifically, a diffusion model incorporating LSTM with attention achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art RNN blocks, such as TTT and Mamba2. Moreover, existing diffusion-RNN approaches often suffer from performance degradation due to training-inference gap or the lack of overlap across windows. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Recurrent Autoregressive Diffusion (RAD) framework, which executes frame-wise autoregression for memory update and retrieval, consistently across training and inference time. Experiments on Memory Maze and Minecraft datasets demonstrate the superiority of RAD for long video generation, highlighting the efficiency of LSTM in sequence modeling.

Method: 提出DiffSign攻击框架，集成CLIP损失和掩码提示来改进攻击焦点和可控性，开发两种新颖的风格定制方法指导视觉外观，提升跨域交通标志攻击泛化能力和攻击隐蔽性。

Conclusion: DiffSign能够生成物理鲁棒、高效、可迁移、实用且隐蔽的外观攻击，克服了现有方法的局限性，对交通标志识别系统构成严重威胁。

Abstract: Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) systems play a critical role in Autonomous Driving (AD) systems, enabling real-time detection of road signs, such as STOP and speed limit signs. While these systems are increasingly integrated into commercial vehicles, recent research has exposed their vulnerability to physical-world adversarial appearance attacks. In such attacks, carefully crafted visual patterns are misinterpreted by TSR models as legitimate traffic signs, while remaining inconspicuous or benign to human observers. However, existing adversarial appearance attacks suffer from notable limitations. Pixel-level perturbation-based methods often lack stealthiness and tend to overfit to specific surrogate models, resulting in poor transferability to real-world TSR systems. On the other hand, text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model-based approaches demonstrate limited effectiveness and poor generalization to out-of-distribution sign types.
  In this paper, we present DiffSign, a novel T2I-based appearance attack framework designed to generate physically robust, highly effective, transferable, practical, and stealthy appearance attacks against TSR systems. To overcome the limitations of prior approaches, we propose a carefully designed attack pipeline that integrates CLIP-based loss and masked prompts to improve attack focus and controllability. We also propose two novel style customization methods to guide visual appearance and improve out-of-domain traffic sign attack generalization and attack stealthiness. We conduct extensive evaluations of DiffSign under varied real-world conditions, including different distances, angles, light conditions, and sign categories. Our method achieves an average physical-world attack success rate of 83.3%, leveraging DiffSign's high effectiveness in attack transferability.

TL;DR: UnSAMv2通过无监督学习实现了任意粒度的分割控制，仅需6K未标注图像和0.02%额外参数就能显著提升SAM-2的分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SAM模型在分割粒度控制上的局限性，避免用户需要手动细化结果的问题，同时克服密集标注成本高昂的挑战。

Method: 扩展了UnSAM的分治策略，发现丰富的掩码-粒度对，并引入新颖的粒度控制嵌入来实现精确、连续的分割尺度控制。

Result: 在11个基准测试中显著提升性能：NoC90从5.69降至4.75，1-IoU从58.0提升至73.1，AR1000从49.6提升至68.3。

Conclusion: 少量未标注数据配合粒度感知的自监督学习方法可以释放视觉基础模型的潜力。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) family has become a widely adopted vision foundation model, but its ability to control segmentation granularity remains limited. Users often need to refine results manually - by adding more prompts or selecting from pre-generated masks - to achieve the desired level of detail. This process can be ambiguous, as the same prompt may correspond to several plausible masks, and collecting dense annotations across all granularities is prohibitively expensive, making supervised solutions infeasible. To address this limitation, we introduce UnSAMv2, which enables segment anything at any granularity without human annotations. UnSAMv2 extends the divide-and-conquer strategy of UnSAM by discovering abundant mask-granularity pairs and introducing a novel granularity control embedding that enables precise, continuous control over segmentation scale. Remarkably, with only $6$K unlabeled images and $0.02\%$ additional parameters, UnSAMv2 substantially enhances SAM-2, achieving segment anything at any granularity across interactive, whole-image, and video segmentation tasks. Evaluated on over $11$ benchmarks, UnSAMv2 improves $\text{NoC}_{90}$ (5.69 $\rightarrow$ 4.75), 1-IoU (58.0 $\rightarrow$ 73.1), and $\text{AR}_{1000}$ (49.6 $\rightarrow$ 68.3), showing that small amounts of unlabeled data with a granularity-aware self-supervised learning method can unlock the potential of vision foundation models.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress, multimodal foundation models still exhibit surprising deficiencies in spatial intelligence. In this work, we explore scaling up multimodal foundation models to cultivate spatial intelligence within the SenseNova-SI family, built upon established multimodal foundations including visual understanding models (i.e., Qwen3-VL and InternVL3) and unified understanding and generation models (i.e., Bagel). We take a principled approach to constructing high-performing and robust spatial intelligence by systematically curating SenseNova-SI-8M: eight million diverse data samples under a rigorous taxonomy of spatial capabilities. SenseNova-SI demonstrates unprecedented performance across a broad range of spatial intelligence benchmarks: 68.7% on VSI-Bench, 43.3% on MMSI, 85.6% on MindCube, 54.6% on ViewSpatial, and 50.1% on SITE, while maintaining strong general multimodal understanding (e.g., 84.9% on MMBench-En). More importantly, we analyze the impact of data scaling, discuss early signs of emergent generalization capabilities enabled by diverse data training, analyze the risk of overfitting and language shortcuts, present a preliminary study on spatial chain-of-thought reasoning, and validate the potential downstream application. SenseNova-SI is an ongoing project, and this report will be updated continuously. All newly trained multimodal foundation models are publicly released to facilitate further research in this direction.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念擦除方法要么依赖昂贵的微调，要么进行粗粒度语义分离，往往会损害无关概念且难以适应动态概念集

Method: 构建动态语义图建模概念间关系，包含动态拓扑图构建、自适应聚类识别和选择性边切断三个组件

Result: 在概念相似度和FID指标上达到最先进性能，实现了高效、准确且稳定的概念擦除

Conclusion: GrOCE提供了一种无需重新训练的训练无关框架，能够进行精确和自适应的概念移除

Abstract: Concept erasure aims to remove harmful, inappropriate, or copyrighted content from text-to-image diffusion models while preserving non-target semantics. However, existing methods either rely on costly fine-tuning or apply coarse semantic separation, often degrading unrelated concepts and lacking adaptability to evolving concept sets. To alleviate this issue, we propose Graph-Guided Online Concept Erasure (GrOCE), a training-free framework that performs precise and adaptive concept removal through graph-based semantic reasoning. GrOCE models concepts and their interrelations as a dynamic semantic graph, enabling principled reasoning over dependencies and fine-grained isolation of undesired content. It comprises three components: (1) Dynamic Topological Graph Construction for incremental graph building, (2) Adaptive Cluster Identification for multi-hop traversal with similarity-decay scoring, and (3) Selective Edge Severing for targeted edge removal while preserving global semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GrOCE achieves state-of-the-art performance on Concept Similarity (CS) and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) metrics, offering efficient, accurate, and stable concept erasure without retraining.

Motivation: 空间转录组技术面临临床采用障碍，现有计算方法难以捕捉spots内的生物异质性，且易受形态学噪声影响。

Method: 提出HiFusion框架：1) 分层spot内建模模块，通过多分辨率子块分解提取细粒度形态表征；2) 上下文感知跨尺度融合模块，使用交叉注意力选择性整合生物相关区域上下文。

Result: 在两个基准ST数据集上的实验表明，HiFusion在2D切片交叉验证和更具挑战性的3D样本特定场景中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: HiFusion作为从常规组织病理学进行ST推断的稳健、准确且可扩展解决方案具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) bridges gene expression and tissue morphology but faces clinical adoption barriers due to technical complexity and prohibitive costs. While computational methods predict gene expression from H&E-stained whole-slide images (WSIs), existing approaches often fail to capture the intricate biological heterogeneity within spots and are susceptible to morphological noise when integrating contextual information from surrounding tissue. To overcome these limitations, we propose HiFusion, a novel deep learning framework that integrates two complementary components. First, we introduce the Hierarchical Intra-Spot Modeling module that extracts fine-grained morphological representations through multi-resolution sub-patch decomposition, guided by a feature alignment loss to ensure semantic consistency across scales. Concurrently, we present the Context-aware Cross-scale Fusion module, which employs cross-attention to selectively incorporate biologically relevant regional context, thereby enhancing representational capacity. This architecture enables comprehensive modeling of both cellular-level features and tissue microenvironmental cues, which are essential for accurate gene expression prediction. Extensive experiments on two benchmark ST datasets demonstrate that HiFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance across both 2D slide-wise cross-validation and more challenging 3D sample-specific scenarios. These results underscore HiFusion's potential as a robust, accurate, and scalable solution for ST inference from routine histopathology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络量化方法在空间区域上采用统一的位精度，忽略了视觉数据的异构结构和纹理复杂性。

Method: 使用五种形态学指标（分形维度、纹理熵、梯度方差、边缘密度和轮廓复杂度）来表征局部视觉形态，并基于这些指标与量化敏感性的相关性进行空间自适应位分配；采用课程式量化感知训练方案逐步增加量化难度。

Result: 在安全装备数据集上达到85.6% mAP@0.5，平均4.2位精度，7.6倍压缩比，比均匀4位量化提高3.5个百分点mAP，每张图像仅增加1.8ms运行时间；在COCO和Pascal VOC数据集上验证了性能一致性。

Conclusion: 形态驱动的空间量化能够提升计算受限、安全关键视觉识别任务的效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Most neural network quantization methods apply uniform bit precision across spatial regions, ignoring the heterogeneous structural and textural complexity of visual data. This paper introduces MCAQ-YOLO, a morphological complexity-aware quantization framework for object detection. The framework employs five morphological metrics - fractal dimension, texture entropy, gradient variance, edge density, and contour complexity - to characterize local visual morphology and guide spatially adaptive bit allocation. By correlating these metrics with quantization sensitivity, MCAQ-YOLO dynamically adjusts bit precision according to spatial complexity. In addition, a curriculum-based quantization-aware training scheme progressively increases quantization difficulty to stabilize optimization and accelerate convergence. Experimental results demonstrate a strong correlation between morphological complexity and quantization sensitivity and show that MCAQ-YOLO achieves superior detection accuracy and convergence efficiency compared with uniform quantization. On a safety equipment dataset, MCAQ-YOLO attains 85.6 percent mAP@0.5 with an average of 4.2 bits and a 7.6x compression ratio, yielding 3.5 percentage points higher mAP than uniform 4-bit quantization while introducing only 1.8 ms of additional runtime overhead per image. Cross-dataset validation on COCO and Pascal VOC further confirms consistent performance gains, indicating that morphology-driven spatial quantization can enhance efficiency and robustness for computationally constrained, safety-critical visual recognition tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法为直接从现有3D资产构建交互式、机器人就绪的模拟环境提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Building interactive simulators and scalable robot-learning environments requires a large number of articulated assets. However, most existing 3D assets in simulation are rigid, and manually converting them into articulated objects is extremely labor- and cost-intensive. This raises a natural question: can we automatically identify articulable objects in a scene and convert them into articulated assets directly? In this paper, we present ArtiWorld, a scene-aware pipeline that localizes candidate articulable objects from textual scene descriptions and reconstructs executable URDF models that preserve the original geometry. At the core of this pipeline is Arti4URDF, which leverages 3D point cloud, prior knowledge of a large language model (LLM), and a URDF-oriented prompt design to rapidly convert rigid objects into interactive URDF-based articulated objects while maintaining their 3D shape. We evaluate ArtiWorld at three levels: 3D simulated objects, full 3D simulated scenes, and real-world scan scenes. Across all three settings, our method consistently outperforms existing approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance, while preserving object geometry and correctly capturing object interactivity to produce usable URDF-based articulated models. This provides a practical path toward building interactive, robot-ready simulation environments directly from existing 3D assets. Code and data will be released.

Motivation: 对比视觉语言模型如CLIP在零样本识别中表现良好，但容易受到虚假相关性的影响，特别是对背景的过度依赖。现有基准仅依赖准确率，隐含地将所有性能下降归因于背景相关性，这一假设不完整。

Method: 提出基于聚类的概念重要性方法，使用CLIP自身的补丁嵌入将空间补丁分组为语义连贯的簇，遮蔽它们并评估模型预测的相对变化。结合GroundedSAM自动将预测分类为前景或背景驱动。引入COVAR基准系统变化对象前景和背景。

Conclusion: CCI提供了关键的诊断能力，结合COVAR基准能够更全面地评估视觉语言模型的鲁棒性，为构建更鲁棒的VLM指明了路径。

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot recognition yet remain vulnerable to spurious correlations, particularly background over-reliance. We introduce Cluster-based Concept Importance (CCI), a novel interpretability method that uses CLIP's own patch embeddings to group spatial patches into semantically coherent clusters, mask them, and evaluate relative changes in model predictions. CCI sets a new state of the art on faithfulness benchmarks, surpassing prior methods by large margins; for example, it yields more than a twofold improvement on the deletion-AUC metric for MS COCO retrieval. We further propose that CCI, when combined with GroundedSAM, automatically categorizes predictions as foreground- or background-driven, providing a crucial diagnostic ability. Existing benchmarks such as CounterAnimals, however, rely solely on accuracy and implicitly attribute all performance degradation to background correlations. Our analysis shows this assumption to be incomplete, since many errors arise from viewpoint variation, scale shifts, and fine-grained object confusions. To disentangle these effects, we introduce COVAR, a benchmark that systematically varies object foregrounds and backgrounds. Leveraging CCI with COVAR, we present a comprehensive evaluation of eighteen CLIP variants, offering methodological advances and empirical evidence that chart a path toward more robust VLMs.

Result: 实验表明该方法性能优越，能更清晰地理解视觉反事实解释。

Conclusion: WSAE-Net方法有效提升了视觉反事实解释的语义相关性和计算效率。

Abstract: In the domain of non-generative visual counterfactual explanations (CE), traditional techniques frequently involve the substitution of sections within a query image with corresponding sections from distractor images. Such methods have historically overlooked the semantic relevance of the replacement regions to the target object, thereby impairing the model's interpretability and hindering the editing workflow. Addressing these challenges, the present study introduces an innovative methodology named as Weighted Semantic Map with Auto-adaptive Candidate Editing Network (WSAE-Net). Characterized by two significant advancements: the determination of an weighted semantic map and the auto-adaptive candidate editing sequence. First, the generation of the weighted semantic map is designed to maximize the reduction of non-semantic feature units that need to be computed, thereby optimizing computational efficiency. Second, the auto-adaptive candidate editing sequences are designed to determine the optimal computational order among the feature units to be processed, thereby ensuring the efficient generation of counterfactuals while maintaining the semantic relevance of the replacement feature units to the target object. Through comprehensive experimentation, our methodology demonstrates superior performance, contributing to a more lucid and in-depth understanding of visual counterfactual explanations.

Abstract: Image retouching aims to enhance visual quality while aligning with users' personalized aesthetic preferences. To address the challenge of balancing controllability and subjectivity, we propose a unified diffusion-based image retouching framework called PerTouch. Our method supports semantic-level image retouching while maintaining global aesthetics. Using parameter maps containing attribute values in specific semantic regions as input, PerTouch constructs an explicit parameter-to-image mapping for fine-grained image retouching. To improve semantic boundary perception, we introduce semantic replacement and parameter perturbation mechanisms in the training process. To connect natural language instructions with visual control, we develop a VLM-driven agent that can handle both strong and weak user instructions. Equipped with mechanisms of feedback-driven rethinking and scene-aware memory, PerTouch better aligns with user intent and captures long-term preferences. Extensive experiments demonstrate each component's effectiveness and the superior performance of PerTouch in personalized image retouching.

Conclusion: Medal S通过协调空间精度与语义文本指导，在多类别医学分割任务中展现出卓越的效率和准确性，优于基于顺序提示的方法。

Abstract: We introduce Medal S, a medical segmentation foundation model that supports native-resolution spatial and textual prompts within an end-to-end trainable framework. Unlike text-only methods lacking spatial awareness, Medal S achieves channel-wise alignment between volumetric prompts and text embeddings, mitigating inaccuracies from resolution mismatches. By preserving full 3D context, it efficiently processes multiple native-resolution masks in parallel, enhancing multi-class segmentation performance. A lightweight 3D convolutional module enables precise voxel-space refinement guided by both prompt types, supporting up to 243 classes across CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, and microscopy modalities in the BiomedSegFM dataset. Medal S offers two prompting modes: a text-only mode, where model predictions serve as spatial prompts for self-refinement without human input, and a hybrid mode, incorporating manual annotations for enhanced flexibility. For 24-class segmentation, parallel spatial prompting reduces inference time by more than 90% compared to sequential prompting. We propose dynamic resampling to address target-patch ratio imbalance, extending SAT and nnU-Net for data augmentation. Furthermore, we develop optimized text preprocessing, a two-stage inference strategy, and post-processing techniques to improve memory efficiency, precision, and inference speed. On the five-modality average on the validation set, Medal S outperforms SAT with a DSC of 75.44 (vs. 69.83), NSD of 77.34 (vs. 71.06), F1 of 38.24 (vs. 24.88), and DSC TP of 65.46 (vs. 46.97). Medal S achieves excellent performance by harmonizing spatial precision with semantic textual guidance, demonstrating superior efficiency and accuracy in multi-class medical segmentation tasks compared to sequential prompt-based approaches. Medal S will be publicly available at https://github.com/yinghemedical/Medal-S.

Abstract: We present Infinite-Story, a training-free framework for consistent text-to-image (T2I) generation tailored for multi-prompt storytelling scenarios. Built upon a scale-wise autoregressive model, our method addresses two key challenges in consistent T2I generation: identity inconsistency and style inconsistency. To overcome these issues, we introduce three complementary techniques: Identity Prompt Replacement, which mitigates context bias in text encoders to align identity attributes across prompts; and a unified attention guidance mechanism comprising Adaptive Style Injection and Synchronized Guidance Adaptation, which jointly enforce global style and identity appearance consistency while preserving prompt fidelity. Unlike prior diffusion-based approaches that require fine-tuning or suffer from slow inference, Infinite-Story operates entirely at test time, delivering high identity and style consistency across diverse prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art generation performance, while offering over 6X faster inference (1.72 seconds per image) than the existing fastest consistent T2I models, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality for real-world visual storytelling.

TL;DR: DTGS是一个统一框架，将Retinex启发的光照分解与热引导的3D高斯泼溅相结合，用于极低光照条件下的新视角合成，解决了标准3DGS在曝光不足输入下的几何、颜色一致性和辐射稳定性退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在极低光照条件下，新视角合成面临几何、颜色一致性和辐射稳定性的严重退化。标准3D高斯泼溅管道直接应用于曝光不足输入时会失败，因为跨视图的独立增强会导致光照不一致和几何失真。

Method: 提出DTGS框架，通过循环增强-重建机制在增强、几何和热监督之间进行联合优化。包含热监督分支动态平衡增强、结构和热损失，以及嵌入3DGS循环的Retinex分解模块提供物理可解释的反射-光照分离。

Result: 构建了RGBT-LOW多视图低光照热数据集，实验表明DTGS显著优于现有的低光照增强和3D重建基线，在极端光照条件下实现了卓越的辐射一致性、几何保真度和颜色稳定性。

Conclusion: DTGS通过紧密耦合光照分解与热引导的3D高斯泼溅，成功解决了极低光照条件下的新视角合成问题，实现了光照不变的重建效果。

Abstract: Under extremely low-light conditions, novel view synthesis (NVS) faces severe degradation in terms of geometry, color consistency, and radiometric stability. Standard 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) pipelines fail when applied directly to underexposed inputs, as independent enhancement across views causes illumination inconsistencies and geometric distortion. To address this, we present DTGS, a unified framework that tightly couples Retinex-inspired illumination decomposition with thermal-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for illumination-invariant reconstruction. Unlike prior approaches that treat enhancement as a pre-processing step, DTGS performs joint optimization across enhancement, geometry, and thermal supervision through a cyclic enhancement-reconstruction mechanism. A thermal supervisory branch stabilizes both color restoration and geometry learning by dynamically balancing enhancement, structural, and thermal losses. Moreover, a Retinex-based decomposition module embedded within the 3DGS loop provides physically interpretable reflectance-illumination separation, ensuring consistent color and texture across viewpoints. To evaluate our method, we construct RGBT-LOW, a new multi-view low-light thermal dataset capturing severe illumination degradation. Extensive experiments show that DTGS significantly outperforms existing low-light enhancement and 3D reconstruction baselines, achieving superior radiometric consistency, geometric fidelity, and color stability under extreme illumination.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法主要关注时空特征聚合，但收益有限，发现根本瓶颈在于模糊的单帧特征表示而非时空建模本身

Method: 引入梯度隔离低层捷径(GILS)来有效整合细粒度目标细节而不引发捷径学习，以及方向梯度正则化(DGR)来在反向传播期间强制层次特征一致性

Result: 在多个公共数据集上的广泛实验表明，BP-FPN始终建立新的最先进性能

Conclusion: 这是首个完全从反向传播角度为该任务设计的FPN架构，设计具有理论依据，引入可忽略的计算开销，并能无缝集成到现有框架中

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection is a key component of infrared search and tracking systems, yet it remains extremely challenging due to low signal-to-clutter ratios, severe target-background imbalance, and weak discriminative features. Existing deep learning methods primarily focus on spatio-temporal feature aggregation, but their gains are limited, revealing that the fundamental bottleneck lies in ambiguous per-frame feature representations rather than spatio-temporal modeling itself. Motivated by this insight, we propose BP-FPN, a backpropagation-driven feature pyramid architecture that fundamentally rethinks feature learning for small target. BP-FPN introduces Gradient-Isolated Low-Level Shortcut (GILS) to efficiently incorporate fine-grained target details without inducing shortcut learning, and Directional Gradient Regularization (DGR) to enforce hierarchical feature consistency during backpropagation. The design is theoretically grounded, introduces negligible computational overhead, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing frameworks. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that BP-FPN consistently establishes new state-of-the-art performance. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first FPN designed for this task entirely from the backpropagation perspective.

Conclusion: GeoUniPS通过整合3D重建模型的几何先验，显著提升了通用光度立体在复杂场景中的性能，为野外场景的表面法向恢复提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Universal Photometric Stereo is a promising approach for recovering surface normals without strict lighting assumptions. However, it struggles when multi-illumination cues are unreliable, such as under biased lighting or in shadows or self-occluded regions of complex in-the-wild scenes. We propose GeoUniPS, a universal photometric stereo network that integrates synthetic supervision with high-level geometric priors from large-scale 3D reconstruction models pretrained on massive in-the-wild data. Our key insight is that these 3D reconstruction models serve as visual-geometry foundation models, inherently encoding rich geometric knowledge of real scenes. To leverage this, we design a Light-Geometry Dual-Branch Encoder that extracts both multi-illumination cues and geometric priors from the frozen 3D reconstruction model. We also address the limitations of the conventional orthographic projection assumption by introducing the PS-Perp dataset with realistic perspective projection to enable learning of spatially varying view directions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoUniPS delivers state-of-the-arts performance across multiple datasets, both quantitatively and qualitatively, especially in the complex in-the-wild scenes.

TL;DR: REVISOR是一个用于长视频理解的多模态反思框架，通过文本和视觉模态的协作反思过程，解决了纯文本反思机制在长视频理解中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纯文本反思机制在长视频理解中存在两个根本问题：(1)长视频包含更丰富动态的视觉输入，仅反思文本信息不足；(2)缺乏跨模态交互能力，无法在反思过程中充分整合视觉信息。

Method: 提出REVISOR框架，支持多模态协作反思；设计DADR奖励机制，确保在强化学习中准确回顾与问题高度相关的视频片段；集成到GRPO训练策略中，强制模型推理与所选视频证据之间的因果对齐。

Result: 在VideoMME、LongVideoBench、MLVU和LVBench四个基准测试中取得了令人印象深刻的结果，显著提升了MLLMs的长视频理解能力。

Conclusion: REVISOR框架无需额外的监督微调或外部模型，就能显著增强MLLMs的长视频理解能力，解决了纯文本反思机制在多模态任务中的局限性。

Abstract: Self-reflection mechanisms that rely on purely text-based rethinking processes perform well in most multimodal tasks. However, when directly applied to long-form video understanding scenarios, they exhibit clear limitations. The fundamental reasons for this lie in two points: (1)long-form video understanding involves richer and more dynamic visual input, meaning rethinking only the text information is insufficient and necessitates a further rethinking process specifically targeting visual information; (2) purely text-based reflection mechanisms lack cross-modal interaction capabilities, preventing them from fully integrating visual information during reflection. Motivated by these insights, we propose REVISOR (REflective VIsual Segment Oriented Reasoning), a novel framework for tool-augmented multimodal reflection. REVISOR enables MLLMs to collaboratively construct introspective reflection processes across textual and visual modalities, significantly enhancing their reasoning capability for long-form video understanding. To ensure that REVISOR can learn to accurately review video segments highly relevant to the question during reinforcement learning, we designed the Dual Attribution Decoupled Reward (DADR) mechanism. Integrated into the GRPO training strategy, this mechanism enforces causal alignment between the model's reasoning and the selected video evidence. Notably, the REVISOR framework significantly enhances long-form video understanding capability of MLLMs without requiring supplementary supervised fine-tuning or external models, achieving impressive results on four benchmarks including VideoMME, LongVideoBench, MLVU, and LVBench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常采用以自我为中心的范式，在整个场景中聚合和扩散特征，但忽略了细粒度的对象级细节，导致在复杂环境中出现语义和几何模糊。

Method: 使用MobileSAM从输入图像中提取实例掩码；引入3D语义组注意力模块在3D空间中聚合面向对象的特征；设计全局相似性引导注意力模块处理分割错误和缺失实例；提出实例感知局部扩散模块通过生成过程改进实例特征并在BEV空间中细化场景表示。

Conclusion: Ocean通过对象中心的方法有效解决了现有3D语义场景补全方法中的语义和几何模糊问题，在复杂驾驶场景中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Vision-based 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has received growing attention due to its potential in autonomous driving. While most existing approaches follow an ego-centric paradigm by aggregating and diffusing features over the entire scene, they often overlook fine-grained object-level details, leading to semantic and geometric ambiguities, especially in complex environments. To address this limitation, we propose Ocean, an object-centric prediction framework that decomposes the scene into individual object instances to enable more accurate semantic occupancy prediction. Specifically, we first employ a lightweight segmentation model, MobileSAM, to extract instance masks from the input image. Then, we introduce a 3D Semantic Group Attention module that leverages linear attention to aggregate object-centric features in 3D space. To handle segmentation errors and missing instances, we further design a Global Similarity-Guided Attention module that leverages segmentation features for global interaction. Finally, we propose an Instance-aware Local Diffusion module that improves instance features through a generative process and subsequently refines the scene representation in the BEV space. Extensive experiments on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI360 benchmarks demonstrate that Ocean achieves state-of-the-art performance, with mIoU scores of 17.40 and 20.28, respectively.

Abstract: We present Uni-Inter, a unified framework for human motion generation that supports a wide range of interaction scenarios: including human-human, human-object, and human-scene-within a single, task-agnostic architecture. In contrast to existing methods that rely on task-specific designs and exhibit limited generalization, Uni-Inter introduces the Unified Interactive Volume (UIV), a volumetric representation that encodes heterogeneous interactive entities into a shared spatial field. This enables consistent relational reasoning and compound interaction modeling. Motion generation is formulated as joint-wise probabilistic prediction over the UIV, allowing the model to capture fine-grained spatial dependencies and produce coherent, context-aware behaviors. Experiments across three representative interaction tasks demonstrate that Uni-Inter achieves competitive performance and generalizes well to novel combinations of entities. These results suggest that unified modeling of compound interactions offers a promising direction for scalable motion synthesis in complex environments.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has demonstrated strong generalization across a wide range of visual tasks by leveraging large-scale English-image pairs. However, its extension to low-resource languages remains limited due to the scarcity of high-quality multilingual image-text data. Existing multilingual vision-language models exhibit consistently low retrieval performance in underrepresented languages including Czech, Finnish, Croatian, Hungarian, and Romanian on the Crossmodal-3600 (XM3600) benchmark. To address this, we propose a lightweight and data-efficient framework for multilingual vision-language alignment. Our approach requires no image-text pairs or text-text pairs and freezes both the pretrained image encoder and multilingual text encoder during training. Only a compact 1.7M-parameter projection module is trained, using a contrastive loss over English representations as semantic anchors. This minimal training setup enables robust multilingual alignment even for languages with limited supervision. Extensive evaluation across multiple multilingual retrieval benchmarks confirms the effectiveness of our method, showing significant gains in five underrepresented languages where existing models typically underperform. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our pivot-based, parameter-efficient alignment strategy for inclusive multimodal learning.

Method: MGCA-Net包含定位器、动作存在预测器、传统分类器和粗到细分类器。定位器生成类别无关的动作提议，动作存在预测器估计提议属于动作实例的概率，传统分类器在片段粒度预测基础动作类别，粗到细分类器在视频粒度识别动作存在并在提议粒度分配粗粒度类别。

Result: 在THUMOS'14和ActivityNet-1.3基准测试中达到最先进性能，在零样本时序动作定位设置下也取得最先进结果。

Conclusion: 通过基础动作的传统分类器感知和新动作的粗到细类别感知，实现了多粒度类别感知，有效增强了定位性能。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Temporal Action Localization (OV-TAL) aims to recognize and localize instances of any desired action categories in videos without explicitly curating training data for all categories. Existing methods mostly recognize action categories at a single granularity, which degrades the recognition accuracy of both base and novel action categories. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Grained Category-Aware Network (MGCA-Net) comprising a localizer, an action presence predictor, a conventional classifier, and a coarse-to-fine classifier. Specifically, the localizer localizes category-agnostic action proposals. For these action proposals, the action presence predictor estimates the probability that they belong to an action instance. At the same time, the conventional classifier predicts the probability of each action proposal over base action categories at the snippet granularity. Novel action categories are recognized by the coarse-to-fine classifier, which first identifies action presence at the video granularity. Finally, it assigns each action proposal to one category from the coarse categories at the proposal granularity. Through coarse-to-fine category awareness for novel actions and the conventional classifier's awareness of base actions, multi-grained category awareness is achieved, effectively enhancing localization performance. Comprehensive evaluations on the THUMOS'14 and ActivityNet-1.3 benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, our MGCA-Net achieves state-of-the-art results under the Zero-Shot Temporal Action Localization setting.

Conclusion: DiffPixelFormer通过同时增强模态内表示和建模模态间交互，实现了更精确的RGB-D室内场景语义分割。

Abstract: Indoor semantic segmentation is fundamental to computer vision and robotics, supporting applications such as autonomous navigation, augmented reality, and smart environments. Although RGB-D fusion leverages complementary appearance and geometric cues, existing methods often depend on computationally intensive cross-attention mechanisms and insufficiently model intra- and inter-modal feature relationships, resulting in imprecise feature alignment and limited discriminative representation. To address these challenges, we propose DiffPixelFormer, a differential pixel-aware Transformer for RGB-D indoor scene segmentation that simultaneously enhances intra-modal representations and models inter-modal interactions. At its core, the Intra-Inter Modal Interaction Block (IIMIB) captures intra-modal long-range dependencies via self-attention and models inter-modal interactions with the Differential-Shared Inter-Modal (DSIM) module to disentangle modality-specific and shared cues, enabling fine-grained, pixel-level cross-modal alignment. Furthermore, a dynamic fusion strategy balances modality contributions and fully exploits RGB-D information according to scene characteristics. Extensive experiments on the SUN RGB-D and NYUDv2 benchmarks demonstrate that DiffPixelFormer-L achieves mIoU scores of 54.28% and 59.95%, outperforming DFormer-L by 1.78% and 2.75%, respectively.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够显著提升复杂视频推理的鲁棒性和准确性，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: Complex video reasoning remains a significant challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), as current R1-based methodologies often prioritize text-centric reasoning derived from text-based and image-based developments. In video tasks, such strategies frequently underutilize rich visual information, leading to potential shortcut learning and increased susceptibility to hallucination. To foster a more robust, visual-centric video understanding, we start by introducing a novel self-supervised reinforcement learning GRPO algorithm (Pretext-GRPO) within the standard R1 pipeline, in which positive rewards are assigned for correctly solving pretext tasks on transformed visual inputs, which makes the model to non-trivially process the visual information. Building on the effectiveness of Pretext-GRPO, we further propose the ViSS-R1 framework, which streamlines and integrates pretext-task-based self-supervised learning directly into the MLLM's R1 post-training paradigm. Instead of relying solely on sparse visual cues, our framework compels models to reason about transformed visual input by simultaneously processing both pretext questions (concerning transformations) and true user queries. This necessitates identifying the applied transformation and reconstructing the original video to formulate accurate final answers. Comprehensive evaluations on six widely-used video reasoning and understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our Pretext-GRPO and ViSS-R1 for complex video reasoning. Our codes and models will be publicly available.

Abstract: Monocular 3D lane detection is challenged by aleatoric uncertainty arising from inherent observation noise. Existing methods rely on simplified geometric assumptions, such as independent point predictions or global planar modeling, failing to capture structural variations and aleatoric uncertainty in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose MonoUnc, a bird's-eye view (BEV)-free 3D lane detector that explicitly models aleatoric uncertainty informed by local lane structures. Specifically, 3D lanes are projected onto the front-view (FV) space and approximated by parametric curves. Guided by curve predictions, curve-point query embeddings are dynamically generated for lane point predictions in 3D space. Each segment formed by two adjacent points is modeled as a 3D Gaussian, parameterized by the local structure and uncertainty estimations. Accordingly, a novel 3D Gaussian matching loss is designed to constrain these parameters jointly. Experiments on the ONCE-3DLanes and OpenLane datasets demonstrate that MonoUnc outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods across all benchmarks under stricter evaluation criteria. Additionally, we propose two comprehensive evaluation metrics for ONCE-3DLanes, calculating the average and maximum bidirectional Chamfer distances to quantify global and local errors.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of neural structures in Electron Microscopy (EM) images is paramount for neuroscience. However, this task is challenged by intricate morphologies, low signal-to-noise ratios, and scarce annotations, limiting the accuracy and generalization of existing methods. To address these challenges, we seek to leverage the priors learned by visual foundation models on a vast amount of natural images to better tackle this task. Specifically, we propose a novel framework that can effectively transfer knowledge from Segment Anything 2 (SAM2), which is pre-trained on natural images, to the EM domain. We first use SAM2 to extract powerful, general-purpose features. To bridge the domain gap, we introduce a Feature-Guided Attention module that leverages semantic cues from SAM2 to guide a lightweight encoder, the Fine-Grained Encoder (FGE), in focusing on these challenging regions. Finally, a dual-affinity decoder generates both coarse and refined affinity maps. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches with the SAM2 weights frozen. Upon further fine-tuning on EM data, our method significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods. This study validates that transferring representations pre-trained on natural images, when combined with targeted domain-adaptive guidance, can effectively address the specific challenges in neuron segmentation.

Abstract: Appearance-based gait recognition have achieved strong performance on controlled datasets, yet systematic evaluation of its robustness to real-world corruptions and silhouette variability remains lacking. We present RobustGait, a framework for fine-grained robustness evaluation of appearance-based gait recognition systems. RobustGait evaluation spans four dimensions: the type of perturbation (digital, environmental, temporal, occlusion), the silhouette extraction method (segmentation and parsing networks), the architectural capacities of gait recognition models, and various deployment scenarios. The benchmark introduces 15 corruption types at 5 severity levels across CASIA-B, CCPG, and SUSTech1K, with in-the-wild validation on MEVID, and evaluates six state-of-the-art gait systems. We came across several exciting insights. First, applying noise at the RGB level better reflects real-world degradation, and reveal how distortions propagate through silhouette extraction to the downstream gait recognition systems. Second, gait accuracy is highly sensitive to silhouette extractor biases, revealing an overlooked source of benchmark bias. Third, robustness is dependent on both the type of perturbation and the architectural design. Finally, we explore robustness-enhancing strategies, showing that noise-aware training and knowledge distillation improve performance and move toward deployment-ready systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出AdaptiveAD架构，通过双分支结构解耦场景感知和自车状态，解决现有端到端自动驾驶系统过度依赖自车状态的问题，提升泛化能力和场景理解鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模块化规划导向的自动驾驶架构过度依赖自车状态，限制了泛化能力和鲁棒场景理解。根本原因是自车状态在BEV编码器中过早融合，导致下游规划模块过度依赖这一强先验。

Method: 采用多上下文融合策略的双分支架构：一个分支基于多任务学习进行场景驱动推理（BEV编码器故意省略自车状态），另一个分支仅基于规划任务进行自车驱动推理。通过场景感知融合模块自适应整合两个分支的决策。引入路径注意力机制进行自车-BEV交互，并添加BEV单向蒸馏和自回归在线映射两个辅助任务。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的广泛评估表明，AdaptiveAD实现了最先进的开环规划性能，显著减轻了对自车状态的过度依赖，并在多样化场景中展现出令人印象深刻的泛化能力。

Conclusion: AdaptiveAD通过架构层面的解决方案有效解决了端到端自动驾驶系统中过度依赖自车状态的问题，为提升系统泛化能力和鲁棒性提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Modular design of planning-oriented autonomous driving has markedly advanced end-to-end systems. However, existing architectures remain constrained by an over-reliance on ego status, hindering generalization and robust scene understanding. We identify the root cause as an inherent design within these architectures that allows ego status to be easily leveraged as a shortcut. Specifically, the premature fusion of ego status in the upstream BEV encoder allows an information flow from this strong prior to dominate the downstream planning module. To address this challenge, we propose AdaptiveAD, an architectural-level solution based on a multi-context fusion strategy. Its core is a dual-branch structure that explicitly decouples scene perception and ego status. One branch performs scene-driven reasoning based on multi-task learning, but with ego status deliberately omitted from the BEV encoder, while the other conducts ego-driven reasoning based solely on the planning task. A scene-aware fusion module then adaptively integrates the complementary decisions from the two branches to form the final planning trajectory. To ensure this decoupling does not compromise multi-task learning, we introduce a path attention mechanism for ego-BEV interaction and add two targeted auxiliary tasks: BEV unidirectional distillation and autoregressive online mapping. Extensive evaluations on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that AdaptiveAD achieves state-of-the-art open-loop planning performance. Crucially, it significantly mitigates the over-reliance on ego status and exhibits impressive generalization capabilities across diverse scenarios.

Result: 在六个TCGA数据集流上的实验表明，MergeSlide优于基于排练的持续学习和视觉语言零样本基线方法。

Conclusion: MergeSlide是一个简单有效的终身学习框架，通过模型合并方法在保持性能的同时缓解灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Lifelong learning on Whole Slide Images (WSIs) aims to train or fine-tune a unified model sequentially on cancer-related tasks, reducing the resources and effort required for data transfer and processing, especially given the gigabyte-scale size of WSIs. In this paper, we introduce MergeSlide, a simple yet effective framework that treats lifelong learning as a model merging problem by leveraging a vision-language pathology foundation model. When a new task arrives, it is: 1) defined with class-aware prompts, 2) fine-tuned for a few epochs using an MLP-free backbone, and 3) merged into a unified model using an orthogonal continual merging strategy that preserves performance and mitigates catastrophic forgetting. For inference under the class-incremental learning (CLASS-IL) setting, where task identity is unknown, we introduce Task-to-Class Prompt-aligned (TCP) inference. Specifically, TCP first identifies the most relevant task using task-level prompts and then applies the corresponding class-aware prompts to generate predictions. To evaluate MergeSlide, we conduct experiments on a stream of six TCGA datasets. The results show that MergeSlide outperforms both rehearsal-based continual learning and vision-language zero-shot baselines.

TL;DR: 本文提出CapeNext框架，通过层次化跨模态交互和双流特征精炼，解决了类别无关姿态估计中静态关节嵌入的歧义性和区分性不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有类别无关姿态估计方法使用固定文本关键点描述作为语义先验，存在两个问题：多义词导致的跨类别歧义（如'腿'在人和家具中的视觉表现差异），以及细粒度类别内变化区分性不足（如不同姿态和毛色的猫）。

Method: 提出新框架，创新性地整合层次化跨模态交互与双流特征精炼，从文本描述和特定图像中提取类别级和实例特定线索来增强关节嵌入。

Result: 在MP-100数据集上的实验表明，无论使用何种网络骨干，CapeNext都大幅优于最先进的CAPE方法。

Conclusion: CapeNext通过动态增强的关节嵌入有效解决了静态嵌入的局限性，显著提升了类别无关姿态估计的性能。

Abstract: Recent research in Category-Agnostic Pose Estimation (CAPE) has adopted fixed textual keypoint description as semantic prior for two-stage pose matching frameworks. While this paradigm enhances robustness and flexibility by disentangling the dependency of support images, our critical analysis reveals two inherent limitations of static joint embedding: (1) polysemy-induced cross-category ambiguity during the matching process(e.g., the concept "leg" exhibiting divergent visual manifestations across humans and furniture), and (2) insufficient discriminability for fine-grained intra-category variations (e.g., posture and fur discrepancies between a sleeping white cat and a standing black cat). To overcome these challenges, we propose a new framework that innovatively integrates hierarchical cross-modal interaction with dual-stream feature refinement, enhancing the joint embedding with both class-level and instance-specific cues from textual description and specific images. Experiments on the MP-100 dataset demonstrate that, regardless of the network backbone, CapeNext consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CAPE methods by a large margin.

Motivation: 现实世界跟踪场景同时包含线性和非线性运动模式，但现有方法要么使用计算高效的卡尔曼滤波器（无法处理非线性运动），要么使用数据驱动预测器（计算开销大且泛化能力有限）。

Method: 提出PlugTrack框架，通过多感知运动理解自适应融合卡尔曼滤波器和数据驱动运动预测器，使用多感知运动分析生成自适应混合因子。

Result: 在MOT17/MOT20上取得显著性能提升，在DanceTrack上达到最先进水平，无需修改现有运动预测器。

Conclusion: PlugTrack是首个通过自适应融合桥接经典和现代运动预测范式的多目标跟踪框架，证明了两种方法的互补性。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) predominantly follows the tracking-by-detection paradigm, where Kalman filters serve as the standard motion predictor due to computational efficiency but inherently fail on non-linear motion patterns. Conversely, recent data-driven motion predictors capture complex non-linear dynamics but suffer from limited domain generalization and computational overhead. Through extensive analysis, we reveal that even in datasets dominated by non-linear motion, Kalman filter outperforms data-driven predictors in up to 34\% of cases, demonstrating that real-world tracking scenarios inherently involve both linear and non-linear patterns. To leverage this complementarity, we propose PlugTrack, a novel framework that adaptively fuses Kalman filter and data-driven motion predictors through multi-perceptive motion understanding. Our approach employs multi-perceptive motion analysis to generate adaptive blending factors. PlugTrack achieves significant performance gains on MOT17/MOT20 and state-of-the-art on DanceTrack without modifying existing motion predictors. To the best of our knowledge, PlugTrack is the first framework to bridge classical and modern motion prediction paradigms through adaptive fusion in MOT.

Motivation: 现有医学图像增强方法需要大规模数据集，训练和存储成本高。现有数据集蒸馏方法主要针对高级任务，而低级任务需要像素级保真度，是一个欠定问题。

Method: 利用患者间的解剖相似性构建共享解剖先验，通过结构保持个性化生成模块为每个患者个性化蒸馏数据，通过梯度对齐注入患者特定知识。

Result: 提出的方法能够构建包含抽象训练信息的蒸馏数据集，保护患者隐私的同时实现高效训练。

Conclusion: 该方法首次解决了医学图像增强中的低级数据集蒸馏问题，在保护隐私的同时显著降低了训练和存储成本。

Abstract: Medical image enhancement is clinically valuable, but existing methods require large-scale datasets to learn complex pixel-level mappings. However, the substantial training and storage costs associated with these datasets hinder their practical deployment. While dataset distillation (DD) can alleviate these burdens, existing methods mainly target high-level tasks, where multiple samples share the same label. This many-to-one mapping allows distilled data to capture shared semantics and achieve information compression. In contrast, low-level tasks involve a many-to-many mapping that requires pixel-level fidelity, making low-level DD an underdetermined problem, as a small distilled dataset cannot fully constrain the dense pixel-level mappings. To address this, we propose the first low-level DD method for medical image enhancement. We first leverage anatomical similarities across patients to construct the shared anatomical prior based on a representative patient, which serves as the initialization for the distilled data of different patients. This prior is then personalized for each patient using a Structure-Preserving Personalized Generation (SPG) module, which integrates patient-specific anatomical information into the distilled dataset while preserving pixel-level fidelity. For different low-level tasks, the distilled data is used to construct task-specific high- and low-quality training pairs. Patient-specific knowledge is injected into the distilled data by aligning the gradients computed from networks trained on the distilled pairs with those from the corresponding patient's raw data. Notably, downstream users cannot access raw patient data. Instead, only a distilled dataset containing abstract training information is shared, which excludes patient-specific details and thus preserves privacy.

Conclusion: DGS-Net通过梯度手术方法有效解决了CLIP模型微调时的灾难性遗忘问题，在AI生成图像检测任务中表现出优越的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models such as GANs and diffusion models has led to the widespread proliferation of AI-generated images, raising concerns about misinformation, privacy violations, and trust erosion in digital media. Although large-scale multimodal models like CLIP offer strong transferable representations for detecting synthetic content, fine-tuning them often induces catastrophic forgetting, which degrades pre-trained priors and limits cross-domain generalization. To address this issue, we propose the Distillation-guided Gradient Surgery Network (DGS-Net), a novel framework that preserves transferable pre-trained priors while suppressing task-irrelevant components. Specifically, we introduce a gradient-space decomposition that separates harmful and beneficial descent directions during optimization. By projecting task gradients onto the orthogonal complement of harmful directions and aligning with beneficial ones distilled from a frozen CLIP encoder, DGS-Net achieves unified optimization of prior preservation and irrelevant suppression. Extensive experiments on 50 generative models demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by an average margin of 6.6, achieving superior detection performance and generalization across diverse generation techniques.

Abstract: Image dehazing is an important task in the field of computer vision, aiming at restoring clear and detail-rich visual content from haze-affected images. However, when dealing with complex scenes, existing methods often struggle to strike a balance between fine-grained feature representation of inhomogeneous haze distribution and global consistency modeling. Furthermore, to better learn the common degenerate representation of haze in spatial variations, we propose an unsupervised dehaze method for implicit neural degradation representation. Firstly, inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, we propose a mechanism combining the channel-independent and channel-dependent mechanisms, which efficiently enhances the ability to learn from nonlinear dependencies. which in turn achieves good visual perception in complex scenes. Moreover, we design an implicit neural representation to model haze degradation as a continuous function to eliminate redundant information and the dependence on explicit feature extraction and physical models. To further learn the implicit representation of the haze features, we also designed a dense residual enhancement module from it to eliminate redundant information. This achieves high-quality image restoration. Experimental results show that our method achieves competitive dehaze performance on various public and real-world datasets. This project code will be available at https://github.com/Fan-pixel/NeDR-Dehaze.

Conclusion: MPHM网络通过有效整合多模态先验和分层Mamba架构，显著提升了图像去雨的性能和细节保真度。

Abstract: Rain significantly degrades the performance of computer vision systems, particularly in applications like autonomous driving and video surveillance. While existing deraining methods have made considerable progress, they often struggle with fidelity of semantic and spatial details. To address these limitations, we propose the Multi-Prior Hierarchical Mamba (MPHM) network for image deraining. This novel architecture synergistically integrates macro-semantic textual priors (CLIP) for task-level semantic guidance and micro-structural visual priors (DINOv2) for scene-aware structural information. To alleviate potential conflicts between heterogeneous priors, we devise a progressive Priors Fusion Injection (PFI) that strategically injects complementary cues at different decoder levels. Meanwhile, we equip the backbone network with an elaborate Hierarchical Mamba Module (HMM) to facilitate robust feature representation, featuring a Fourier-enhanced dual-path design that concurrently addresses global context modeling and local detail recovery. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate MPHM's state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 0.57 dB PSNR gain on the Rain200H dataset while delivering superior generalization on real-world rainy scenarios.

Abstract: 3D anomaly detection (AD) is a crucial task in computer vision, aiming to identify anomalous points or regions from point cloud data. However, existing methods may encounter challenges when handling point clouds with changes in orientation and position because the resulting features may vary significantly. To address this problem, we propose a novel Rotationally Invariant Features (RIF) framework for 3D AD. Firstly, to remove the adverse effect of variations on point cloud data, we develop a Point Coordinate Mapping (PCM) technique, which maps each point into a rotationally invariant space to maintain consistency of representation. Then, to learn robust and discriminative features, we design a lightweight Convolutional Transform Feature Network (CTF-Net) to extract rotationally invariant features for the memory bank. To improve the ability of the feature extractor, we introduce the idea of transfer learning to pre-train the feature extractor with 3D data augmentation. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves the advanced performance on the Anomaly-ShapeNet dataset, with an average P-AUROC improvement of 17.7\%, and also gains the best performance on the Real3D-AD dataset, with an average P-AUROC improvement of 1.6\%. The strong generalization ability of RIF has been verified by combining it with traditional feature extraction methods on anomaly detection tasks, demonstrating great potential for industrial applications.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes and synthesizing novel views from sparse input views is a highly challenging task. Recent advances in video diffusion models have demonstrated strong temporal reasoning capabilities, making them a promising tool for enhancing reconstruction quality under sparse-view settings. However, existing approaches are primarily designed for modest viewpoint variations, which struggle in capturing fine-grained details in close-up scenarios since input information is severely limited. In this paper, we present a diffusion-based framework, called CloseUpShot, for close-up novel view synthesis from sparse inputs via point-conditioned video diffusion. Specifically, we observe that pixel-warping conditioning suffers from severe sparsity and background leakage in close-up settings. To address this, we propose hierarchical warping and occlusion-aware noise suppression, enhancing the quality and completeness of the conditioning images for the video diffusion model. Furthermore, we introduce global structure guidance, which leverages a dense fused point cloud to provide consistent geometric context to the diffusion process, to compensate for the lack of globally consistent 3D constraints in sparse conditioning inputs. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, especially in close-up novel view synthesis, clearly validating the effectiveness of our design.

Abstract: Recent learning-based methods have reduced the computational complexity of traditional trajectory similarity computation, but state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods still fail to leverage the comprehensive spectrum of trajectory information for similarity modeling. To tackle this problem, we propose \textbf{RePo}, a novel method that jointly encodes \textbf{Re}gion-wise and \textbf{Po}int-wise features to capture both spatial context and fine-grained moving patterns. For region-wise representation, the GPS trajectories are first mapped to grid sequences, and spatial context are captured by structural features and semantic context enriched by visual features. For point-wise representation, three lightweight expert networks extract local, correlation, and continuous movement patterns from dense GPS sequences. Then, a router network adaptively fuses the learned point-wise features, which are subsequently combined with region-wise features using cross-attention to produce the final trajectory embedding. To train RePo, we adopt a contrastive loss with hard negative samples to provide similarity ranking supervision. Experiment results show that RePo achieves an average accuracy improvement of 22.2\% over SOTA baselines across all evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: VEIL框架揭示了文本到视频模型的安全盲点，表明看似良性的提示可以通过跨模态关联诱导模型生成不安全内容，这对模型安全防护提出了新的挑战。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks can circumvent model safety guardrails and reveal critical blind spots. Prior attacks on text-to-video (T2V) models typically add adversarial perturbations to obviously unsafe prompts, which are often easy to detect and defend. In contrast, we show that benign-looking prompts containing rich, implicit cues can induce T2V models to generate semantically unsafe videos that both violate policy and preserve the original (blocked) intent. To realize this, we propose VEIL, a jailbreak framework that leverages T2V models' cross-modal associative patterns via a modular prompt design. Specifically, our prompts combine three components: neutral scene anchors, which provide the surface-level scene description extracted from the blocked intent to maintain plausibility; latent auditory triggers, textual descriptions of innocuous-sounding audio events (e.g., creaking, muffled noises) that exploit learned audio-visual co-occurrence priors to bias the model toward particular unsafe visual concepts; and stylistic modulators, cinematic directives (e.g., camera framing, atmosphere) that amplify and stabilize the latent trigger's effect. We formalize attack generation as a constrained optimization over the above modular prompt space and solve it with a guided search procedure that balances stealth and effectiveness. Extensive experiments over 7 T2V models demonstrate the efficacy of our attack, achieving a 23 percent improvement in average attack success rate in commercial models.

Conclusion: MedGEN-Bench为医学AI研究提供了更全面的评估标准，强调上下文交织指令和开放式生成输出，推动医学AI向更实用的临床应用发展。

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) increasingly gain traction in medical applications, clinicians are progressively expecting AI systems not only to generate textual diagnoses but also to produce corresponding medical images that integrate seamlessly into authentic clinical workflows. Despite the growing interest, existing medical visual benchmarks present notable limitations. They often rely on ambiguous queries that lack sufficient relevance to image content, oversimplify complex diagnostic reasoning into closed-ended shortcuts, and adopt a text-centric evaluation paradigm that overlooks the importance of image generation capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce \textsc{MedGEN-Bench}, a comprehensive multimodal benchmark designed to advance medical AI research. MedGEN-Bench comprises 6,422 expert-validated image-text pairs spanning six imaging modalities, 16 clinical tasks, and 28 subtasks. It is structured into three distinct formats: Visual Question Answering, Image Editing, and Contextual Multimodal Generation. What sets MedGEN-Bench apart is its focus on contextually intertwined instructions that necessitate sophisticated cross-modal reasoning and open-ended generative outputs, moving beyond the constraints of multiple-choice formats. To evaluate the performance of existing systems, we employ a novel three-tier assessment framework that integrates pixel-level metrics, semantic text analysis, and expert-guided clinical relevance scoring. Using this framework, we systematically assess 10 compositional frameworks, 3 unified models, and 5 VLMs.

Method: 提出WinMamba块组成的骨干网络，包含窗口尺度自适应模块（补偿不同分辨率下的体素特征）和窗口移位策略（在线性状态空间中获取丰富上下文线索），并配备可学习位置编码。

Result: 在KITTI和Waymo数据集上的广泛实验表明，WinMamba显著优于基线方法。消融研究验证了WSF和AWF模块对提高检测精度的独立贡献。

Conclusion: WinMamba通过创新的窗口尺度自适应和窗口移位策略，成功平衡了3D目标检测中的计算效率和长距离依赖捕获能力，代码将公开提供。

Abstract: 3D object detection is critical for autonomous driving, yet it remains fundamentally challenging to simultaneously maximize computational efficiency and capture long-range spatial dependencies. We observed that Mamba-based models, with their linear state-space design, capture long-range dependencies at lower cost, offering a promising balance between efficiency and accuracy. However, existing methods rely on axis-aligned scanning within a fixed window, inevitably discarding spatial information. To address this problem, we propose WinMamba, a novel Mamba-based 3D feature-encoding backbone composed of stacked WinMamba blocks. To enhance the backbone with robust multi-scale representation, the WinMamba block incorporates a window-scale-adaptive module that compensates voxel features across varying resolutions during sampling. Meanwhile, to obtain rich contextual cues within the linear state space, we equip the WinMamba layer with a learnable positional encoding and a window-shift strategy. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate that WinMamba significantly outperforms the baseline. Ablation studies further validate the individual contributions of the WSF and AWF modules in improving detection accuracy. The code will be made publicly available.

*Rifen Lin,Alex Jinpeng Wang,Jiawei Mo,Min Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CSIP-ReID是首个基于骨架的预训练框架，用于视频行人重识别。它通过对比学习对齐骨架和视觉特征，并引入原型融合更新器和骨架引导时序建模模块，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态预训练方法依赖视频-文本对，但存在两个根本限制：(1)缺乏真正的多模态预训练，(2)文本难以捕捉细粒度时序运动信息。骨架序列能提供与视频帧对齐的时空信息模态。

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段使用对比学习在序列级别对齐骨架和视觉特征；第二阶段引入动态原型融合更新器(PFU)来优化多模态身份原型，融合运动和外观线索；还提出骨架引导时序建模(SGTM)模块，从骨架数据中提取时序线索并整合到视觉特征中。

Result: 在标准视频ReID基准测试(MARS、LS-VID、iLIDS-VID)上达到新的最先进结果；在纯骨架ReID任务(BIWI、IAS)上表现出强大的泛化能力，显著优于先前方法。

Conclusion: CSIP-ReID开创了无标注和运动感知的ReID预训练范式，为多模态表示学习开辟了新前沿。

Abstract: Multimodal pretraining has revolutionized visual understanding, but its impact on video-based person re-identification (ReID) remains underexplored. Existing approaches often rely on video-text pairs, yet suffer from two fundamental limitations: (1) lack of genuine multimodal pretraining, and (2) text poorly captures fine-grained temporal motion-an essential cue for distinguishing identities in video. In this work, we take a bold departure from text-based paradigms by introducing the first skeleton-driven pretraining framework for ReID. To achieve this, we propose Contrastive Skeleton-Image Pretraining for ReID (CSIP-ReID), a novel two-stage method that leverages skeleton sequences as a spatiotemporally informative modality aligned with video frames. In the first stage, we employ contrastive learning to align skeleton and visual features at sequence level. In the second stage, we introduce a dynamic Prototype Fusion Updater (PFU) to refine multimodal identity prototypes, fusing motion and appearance cues. Moreover, we propose a Skeleton Guided Temporal Modeling (SGTM) module that distills temporal cues from skeleton data and integrates them into visual features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CSIP-ReID achieves new state-of-the-art results on standard video ReID benchmarks (MARS, LS-VID, iLIDS-VID). Moreover, it exhibits strong generalization to skeleton-only ReID tasks (BIWI, IAS), significantly outperforming previous methods. CSIP-ReID pioneers an annotation-free and motion-aware pretraining paradigm for ReID, opening a new frontier in multimodal representation learning.

Motivation: 乳腺癌是全球女性主要死因之一，早期诊断和准确临床决策至关重要。传统深度学习方法需要大量标注数据和GPU资源，限制了临床应用。

Method: 使用立方体持续性从RGB组织病理学图像中提取拓扑指纹，将环的演化编码为紧凑可解释的特征向量，通过计算拓扑描述符距离进行相似性检索。

Result: 在BreaKHis数据集上的实验表明，THIR优于现有监督和无监督方法，在标准CPU上20分钟内处理完整数据集。

Conclusion: THIR提供了一个快速、可扩展且无需训练的临床图像检索解决方案，特别适合资源受限的医疗环境。

Abstract: According to the World Health Organization, breast cancer claimed the lives of approximately 685,000 women in 2020. Early diagnosis and accurate clinical decision making are critical in reducing this global burden. In this study, we propose THIR, a novel Content-Based Medical Image Retrieval (CBMIR) framework that leverages topological data analysis specifically, Betti numbers derived from persistent homology to characterize and retrieve histopathological images based on their intrinsic structural patterns. Unlike conventional deep learning approaches that rely on extensive training, annotated datasets, and powerful GPU resources, THIR operates entirely without supervision. It extracts topological fingerprints directly from RGB histopathological images using cubical persistence, encoding the evolution of loops as compact, interpretable feature vectors. The similarity retrieval is then performed by computing the distances between these topological descriptors, efficiently returning the top-K most relevant matches.
  Extensive experiments on the BreaKHis dataset demonstrate that THIR outperforms state of the art supervised and unsupervised methods. It processes the entire dataset in under 20 minutes on a standard CPU, offering a fast, scalable, and training free solution for clinical image retrieval.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，HDW-SR在超分辨率性能上具有竞争力，特别是在恢复细粒度图像细节方面表现出色。

Conclusion: HDW-SR通过小波分解和频率域引导机制，有效解决了扩散模型在超分辨率任务中高频细节恢复不足的问题，为图像细节增强提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion-based methods have shown great promise in single image super-resolution (SISR); however, existing approaches often produce blurred fine details due to insufficient guidance in the high-frequency domain. To address this issue, we propose a High-Frequency Guided Diffusion Network based on Wavelet Decomposition (HDW-SR), which replaces the conventional U-Net backbone in diffusion frameworks. Specifically, we perform diffusion only on the residual map, allowing the network to focus more effectively on high-frequency information restoration. We then introduce wavelet-based downsampling in place of standard CNN downsampling to achieve multi-scale frequency decomposition, enabling sparse cross-attention between the high-frequency subbands of the pre-super-resolved image and the low-frequency subbands of the diffused image for explicit high-frequency guidance. Moreover, a Dynamic Thresholding Block (DTB) is designed to refine high-frequency selection during the sparse attention process. During upsampling, the invertibility of the wavelet transform ensures low-loss feature reconstruction. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that HDW-SR achieves competitive super-resolution performance, excelling particularly in recovering fine-grained image details. The code will be available after acceptance.

Conclusion: GenTract在研究级数据上产生高精度的纤维束图，同时在低分辨率数据上保持可靠性，是全局纤维束成像的有前景解决方案。

Abstract: Tractography is the process of inferring the trajectories of white-matter pathways in the brain from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI). Local tractography methods, which construct streamlines by following local fiber orientation estimates stepwise through an image, are prone to error accumulation and high false positive rates, particularly on noisy or low-resolution data. In contrast, global methods, which attempt to optimize a collection of streamlines to maximize compatibility with underlying fiber orientation estimates, are computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we introduce GenTract, the first generative model for global tractography. We frame tractography as a generative task, learning a direct mapping from dMRI to complete, anatomically plausible streamlines. We compare both diffusion-based and flow matching paradigms and evaluate GenTract's performance against state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, GenTract achieves precision 2.1x higher than the next-best method, TractOracle. This advantage becomes even more pronounced in challenging low-resolution and noisy settings, where it outperforms the closest competitor by an order of magnitude. By producing tractograms with high precision on research-grade data while also maintaining reliability on imperfect, lower-resolution data, GenTract represents a promising solution for global tractography.

Conclusion: 视觉信息在极端多标签分类中具有关键价值，一张图像相当于数十亿参数的效果。ViXML框架成功平衡了性能与效率，为多模态极端分类提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized artificial intelligence across numerous domains, yet their transformative potential remains largely untapped in Extreme Multi-label Classification (XMC). Queries in XMC are associated with relevant labels from extremely large label spaces, where it is critical to strike a balance between efficiency and performance. Therefore, many recent approaches efficiently pose XMC as a maximum inner product search between embeddings learned from small encoder-only transformer architectures. In this paper, we address two important aspects in XMC: how to effectively harness larger decoder-only models, and how to exploit visual information while maintaining computational efficiency. We demonstrate that both play a critical role in XMC separately and can be combined for improved performance. We show that a few billion-size decoder can deliver substantial improvements while keeping computational overhead manageable. Furthermore, our Vision-enhanced eXtreme Multi-label Learning framework (ViXML) efficiently integrates foundation vision models by pooling a single embedding per image. This limits computational growth while unlocking multi-modal capabilities. Remarkably, ViXML with small encoders outperforms text-only decoder in most cases, showing that an image is worth billions of parameters. Finally, we present an extension of existing text-only datasets to exploit visual metadata and make them available for future benchmarking. Comprehensive experiments across four public text-only datasets and their corresponding image enhanced versions validate our proposals' effectiveness, surpassing previous state-of-the-art by up to +8.21\% in P@1 on the largest dataset. ViXML's code is available at https://github.com/DiegoOrtego/vixml.

Motivation: 现有方法存在查询锁定推理问题，即模型仅关注提示中明确提到的对象而忽略关键上下文线索，导致视频空间推理能力不足。

Method: OCR方法在训练期间对选定对象的3D几何结构引入结构化扰动，通过降级对象特定视觉线索并将改变的几何投影到2D空间，迫使模型进行整体场景推理。

Conclusion: OCR方法通过结构化扰动有效解决了查询锁定推理问题，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的视频空间推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have showcased remarkable capabilities in vision-language understanding. However, enabling robust video spatial reasoning-the ability to comprehend object locations, orientations, and inter-object relationships in dynamic 3D scenes-remains a key unsolved challenge. Existing approaches primarily rely on spatially grounded supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, yet we observe that such models often exhibit query-locked reasoning, focusing narrowly on objects explicitly mentioned in the prompt while ignoring critical contextual cues. To address this limitation, we propose Object-Centric 3D Rollout (OCR), a novel strategy that introduces structured perturbations to the 3D geometry of selected objects during training. By degrading object-specific visual cues and projecting the altered geometry into 2D space, OCR compels the model to reason holistically across the entire scene. We further design a rollout-based training pipeline that jointly leverages vanilla and region-noisy videos to optimize spatial reasoning trajectories. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: our 3B-parameter model achieves 47.5% accuracy on VSI-Bench, outperforming several 7B baselines. Ablations confirm OCR's superiority over prior rollout strategies (e.g., T-GRPO, NoisyRollout).

Abstract: Painting embodies a unique form of visual storytelling, where the creation process is as significant as the final artwork. Although recent advances in generative models have enabled visually compelling painting synthesis, most existing methods focus solely on final image generation or patch-based process simulation, lacking explicit stroke structure and failing to produce smooth, realistic shading. In this work, we present a differentiable stroke reconstruction framework that unifies painting, stylized texturing, and smudging to faithfully reproduce the human painting-smudging loop. Given an input image, our framework first optimizes single- and dual-color Bezier strokes through a parallel differentiable paint renderer, followed by a style generation module that synthesizes geometry-conditioned textures across diverse painting styles. We further introduce a differentiable smudge operator to enable natural color blending and shading. Coupled with a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy, our method jointly optimizes stroke geometry, color, and texture under geometric and semantic guidance. Extensive experiments on oil, watercolor, ink, and digital paintings demonstrate that our approach produces realistic and expressive stroke reconstructions, smooth tonal transitions, and richly stylized appearances, offering a unified model for expressive digital painting creation.

TL;DR: MonoDLGD是一个基于难度感知标签引导去噪的单目3D物体检测框架，通过自适应扰动和重建真实标签来改善几何监督，在KITTI基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目3D物体检测由于深度线索固有的模糊性而存在根本性问题。现有DETR方法虽然通过全局注意力和辅助深度预测尝试缓解，但仍受限于不准确的深度估计，且忽略了实例级检测难度（如遮挡、距离、截断），导致检测性能不佳。

Method: 提出MonoDLGD框架，基于检测不确定性自适应扰动和重建真实标签：对容易实例施加更强扰动，对困难实例施加较弱扰动，然后重建这些标签以提供显式几何监督。通过联合优化标签重建和3D物体检测，促进几何感知表示学习。

Result: 在KITTI基准测试上的广泛实验表明，MonoDLGD在所有难度级别上都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MonoDLGD通过难度感知的标签引导去噪方法，有效改善了单目3D物体检测的几何监督，提升了在不同物体复杂度下的鲁棒性和检测性能。

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection is a cost-effective solution for applications like autonomous driving and robotics, but remains fundamentally ill-posed due to inherently ambiguous depth cues. Recent DETR-based methods attempt to mitigate this through global attention and auxiliary depth prediction, yet they still struggle with inaccurate depth estimates. Moreover, these methods often overlook instance-level detection difficulty, such as occlusion, distance, and truncation, leading to suboptimal detection performance. We propose MonoDLGD, a novel Difficulty-Aware Label-Guided Denoising framework that adaptively perturbs and reconstructs ground-truth labels based on detection uncertainty. Specifically, MonoDLGD applies stronger perturbations to easier instances and weaker ones into harder cases, and then reconstructs them to effectively provide explicit geometric supervision. By jointly optimizing label reconstruction and 3D object detection, MonoDLGD encourages geometry-aware representation learning and improves robustness to varying levels of object complexity. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that MonoDLGD achieves state-of-the-art performance across all difficulty levels.

Motivation: 现有方法将异常事件视为单一类别，忽略了真实世界异常的多样语义和时间特征。受人类感知异常方式的启发，需要同时理解时间运动模式和不同异常类型的语义结构。

Method: 提出RefineVAD框架，包含：1）MoTAR模块：通过基于位移的注意力和全局Transformer建模估计运动显著性并动态调整时间焦点；2）CORE模块：通过跨注意力将片段级特征与可学习类别原型对齐，注入软异常类别先验。

Conclusion: 通过联合利用时间动态和语义结构，RefineVAD能够显式建模运动演化方式和语义类别相似性，有效提升弱监督视频异常检测性能。

Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection aims to identify anomalous events using only video-level labels, balancing annotation efficiency with practical applicability. However, existing methods often oversimplify the anomaly space by treating all abnormal events as a single category, overlooking the diverse semantic and temporal characteristics intrinsic to real-world anomalies. Inspired by how humans perceive anomalies, by jointly interpreting temporal motion patterns and semantic structures underlying different anomaly types, we propose RefineVAD, a novel framework that mimics this dual-process reasoning. Our framework integrates two core modules. The first, Motion-aware Temporal Attention and Recalibration (MoTAR), estimates motion salience and dynamically adjusts temporal focus via shift-based attention and global Transformer-based modeling. The second, Category-Oriented Refinement (CORE), injects soft anomaly category priors into the representation space by aligning segment-level features with learnable category prototypes through cross-attention. By jointly leveraging temporal dynamics and semantic structure, explicitly models both "how" motion evolves and "what" semantic category it resembles. Extensive experiments on WVAD benchmark validate the effectiveness of RefineVAD and highlight the importance of integrating semantic context to guide feature refinement toward anomaly-relevant patterns.

Conclusion: PAVE-Net是首个用于多帧2D人体姿态估计的端到端方法，通过消除启发式操作和引入姿态感知注意力机制，在准确性和效率上都取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Existing multi-person video pose estimation methods typically adopt a two-stage pipeline: detecting individuals in each frame, followed by temporal modeling for single-person pose estimation. This design relies on heuristic operations such as detection, RoI cropping, and non-maximum suppression (NMS), limiting both accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we present a fully end-to-end framework for multi-person 2D pose estimation in videos, effectively eliminating heuristic operations. A key challenge is to associate individuals across frames under complex and overlapping temporal trajectories. To address this, we introduce a novel Pose-Aware Video transformEr Network (PAVE-Net), which features a spatial encoder to model intra-frame relations and a spatiotemporal pose decoder to capture global dependencies across frames. To achieve accurate temporal association, we propose a pose-aware attention mechanism that enables each pose query to selectively aggregate features corresponding to the same individual across consecutive frames.Additionally, we explicitly model spatiotemporal dependencies among pose keypoints to improve accuracy. Notably, our approach is the first end-to-end method for multi-frame 2D human pose estimation.Extensive experiments show that PAVE-Net substantially outperforms prior image-based end-to-end methods, achieving a \textbf{6.0} mAP improvement on PoseTrack2017, and delivers accuracy competitive with state-of-the-art two-stage video-based approaches, while offering significant gains in efficiency.Project page: https://github.com/zgspose/PAVENet

Abstract: Despite recent advancements in 3D-text cross-modal alignment, existing state-of-the-art methods still struggle to align fine-grained textual semantics with detailed geometric structures, and their alignment performance degrades significantly when scaling to large-scale 3D databases. To overcome this limitation, we introduce 3DAlign-DAER, a unified framework designed to align text and 3D geometry via the proposed dynamic attention policy and the efficient retrieval strategy, capturing subtle correspondences for diverse cross-modal retrieval and classification tasks. Specifically, during the training, our proposed dynamic attention policy (DAP) employs the Hierarchical Attention Fusion (HAF) module to represent the alignment as learnable fine-grained token-to-point attentions. To optimize these attentions across different tasks and geometric hierarchies, our DAP further exploits the Monte Carlo tree search to dynamically calibrate HAF attention weights via a hybrid reward signal and further enhances the alignment between textual descriptions and local 3D geometry. During the inference, our 3DAlign-DAER introduces an Efficient Retrieval Strategy (ERS) to leverage efficient hierarchical searching in the large-scale embedding spaces, outperforming traditional methods (e.g., KNN) in accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, to facilitate text-3D alignment research and train our 3DAlign-DAER, we construct Align3D-2M, a large-scale dataset featuring 2M text-3D pairs, to provide sufficient fine-grained cross-modal annotations. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our 3DAlign-DAER on diverse benchmarks. We will release our codes, models, and datasets.

Abstract: Appearance-based gaze estimation, aiming to predict accurate 3D gaze direction from a single facial image, has made promising progress in recent years. However, most methods suffer significant performance degradation in cross-domain evaluation due to interference from gaze-irrelevant factors, such as expressions, wearables, and image quality. To alleviate this problem, we present a novel Hybrid-domain Adaptative Representation Learning (shorted by HARL) framework that exploits multi-source hybrid datasets to learn robust gaze representation. More specifically, we propose to disentangle gaze-relevant representation from low-quality facial images by aligning features extracted from high-quality near-eye images in an unsupervised domain-adaptation manner, which hardly requires any computational or inference costs. Additionally, we analyze the effect of head-pose and design a simple yet efficient sparse graph fusion module to explore the geometric constraint between gaze direction and head-pose, leading to a dense and robust gaze representation. Extensive experiments on EyeDiap, MPIIFaceGaze, and Gaze360 datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of $\textbf{5.02}^{\circ}$ and $\textbf{3.36}^{\circ}$, and $\textbf{9.26}^{\circ}$ respectively, and present competitive performances through cross-dataset evaluation.

TL;DR: MRIQT是一个3D条件扩散框架，用于将便携式超低场MRI图像质量提升到高场MRI水平，通过物理一致的K空间降级模拟、v预测和SNR加权3D感知损失实现高质量图像转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 便携式超低场MRI在新生儿护理中具有可及性优势，但信噪比低、诊断质量差，需要提升图像质量以达到高场MRI的诊断水平。

Method: 结合K空间降级模拟实现物理一致的uLF模拟，使用v预测和分类器自由引导进行稳定的图像生成，采用SNR加权的3D感知损失保持解剖保真度，基于注意力UNet架构进行结构保持转换。

Result: 在新生儿队列上训练，MRIQT在PSNR上超过现有GAN和CNN方法15.3%，比最先进技术高出1.78%，85%的输出被医生评为良好质量且病理清晰可见。

Conclusion: MRIQT能够实现便携式超低场MRI的高保真扩散增强，为可靠的新生儿脑部评估提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Portable ultra-low-field MRI (uLF-MRI, 0.064 T) offers accessible neuroimaging for neonatal care but suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio and poor diagnostic quality compared to high-field (HF) MRI. We propose MRIQT, a 3D conditional diffusion framework for image quality transfer (IQT) from uLF to HF MRI. MRIQT combines realistic K-space degradation for physics-consistent uLF simulation, v-prediction with classifier-free guidance for stable image-to-image generation, and an SNR-weighted 3D perceptual loss for anatomical fidelity. The model denoises from a noised uLF input conditioned on the same scan, leveraging volumetric attention-UNet architecture for structure-preserving translation. Trained on a neonatal cohort with diverse pathologies, MRIQT surpasses recent GAN and CNN baselines in PSNR 15.3% with 1.78% over the state of the art, while physicians rated 85% of its outputs as good quality with clear pathology present. MRIQT enables high-fidelity, diffusion-based enhancement of portable ultra-low-field (uLF) MRI for deliable neonatal brain assessment.

Abstract: Multimodal misinformation floods on various social media, and continues to evolve in the era of AI-generated content (AIGC). The emerged misinformation with low creation cost and high deception poses significant threats to society. While recent studies leverage general-purpose multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to achieve remarkable results in detection, they encounter two critical limitations: (1) Insufficient reasoning, where general-purpose MLLMs often follow the uniform reasoning paradigm but generate inaccurate explanations and judgments, due to the lack of the task-specific knowledge of multimodal misinformation detection. (2) Reasoning biases, where a single thinking mode make detectors a suboptimal path for judgment, struggling to keep pace with the fast-growing and intricate multimodal misinformation. In this paper, we propose MMD-Thinker, a two-stage framework for multimodal misinformation detection through adaptive multi-dimensional thinking. First, we develop tailor-designed thinking mode for multimodal misinformation detection. Second, we adopt task-specific instruction tuning to inject the tailored thinking mode into general-purpose MLLMs. Third, we further leverage reinforcement learning strategy with a mixed advantage function, which incentivizes the reasoning capabilities in trajectories. Furthermore, we construct the multimodal misinformation reasoning (MMR) dataset, encompasses more than 8K image-text pairs with both reasoning processes and classification labels, to make progress in the relam of multimodal misinformation detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed MMD-Thinker achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmark datasets, while maintaining flexible inference and token usage. Code will be publicly available at Github.

Conclusion: 通过多阶段参考特征融合、局部注意力机制和渐进式解码策略，有效提升了指代伪装目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Referring camouflaged object detection (Ref-COD) aims to identify hidden objects by incorporating reference information such as images and text descriptions. Previous research has transformed reference images with salient objects into one-dimensional prompts, yielding significant results. We explore ways to enhance performance through multi-context fusion of rich salient image features and camouflaged object features. Therefore, we propose RFMNet, which utilizes features from multiple encoding stages of the reference salient images and performs interactive fusion with the camouflage features at the corresponding encoding stages. Given that the features in salient object images contain abundant object-related detail information, performing feature fusion within local areas is more beneficial for detecting camouflaged objects. Therefore, we propose an Overlapped Windows Cross-attention mechanism to enable the model to focus more attention on the local information matching based on reference features. Besides, we propose the Referring Feature Aggregation (RFA) module to decode and segment the camouflaged objects progressively. Extensive experiments on the Ref-COD benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), leveraging their powerful visual perception and reasoning capabilities, have been widely applied in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) tasks. However, the spatial intelligence capabilities of existing VLMs in UAV scenarios remain largely unexplored, raising concerns about their effectiveness in navigating and interpreting dynamic environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce SpatialSky-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the spatial intelligence capabilities of VLMs in UAV navigation. Our benchmark comprises two categories-Environmental Perception and Scene Understanding-divided into 13 subcategories, including bounding boxes, color, distance, height, and landing safety analysis, among others. Extensive evaluations of various mainstream open-source and closed-source VLMs reveal unsatisfactory performance in complex UAV navigation scenarios, highlighting significant gaps in their spatial capabilities. To address this challenge, we developed the SpatialSky-Dataset, a comprehensive dataset containing 1M samples with diverse annotations across various scenarios. Leveraging this dataset, we introduce Sky-VLM, a specialized VLM designed for UAV spatial reasoning across multiple granularities and contexts. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Sky-VLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across all benchmark tasks, paving the way for the development of VLMs suitable for UAV scenarios.

Abstract: Lightweight building surface models are crucial for digital city, navigation, and fast geospatial analytics, yet conventional multi-view geometry pipelines remain cumbersome and quality-sensitive due to their reliance on dense reconstruction, meshing, and subsequent simplification. This work presents SF-Recon, a method that directly reconstructs lightweight building surfaces from multi-view images without post-hoc mesh simplification. We first train an initial 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) field to obtain a view-consistent representation. Building structure is then distilled by a normal-gradient-guided Gaussian optimization that selects primitives aligned with roof and wall boundaries, followed by multi-view edge-consistency pruning to enhance structural sharpness and suppress non-structural artifacts without external supervision. Finally, a multi-view depth-constrained Delaunay triangulation converts the structured Gaussian field into a lightweight, structurally faithful building mesh. Based on a proposed SF dataset, the experimental results demonstrate that our SF-Recon can directly reconstruct lightweight building models from multi-view imagery, achieving substantially fewer faces and vertices while maintaining computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有野外人体网格伪真值生成流程以单人为中心，缺乏场景级一致性，导致同一图像中个体深度和尺度冲突。

Method: 引入深度条件平移优化(DTO)方法，在MAP框架下联合优化所有个体的相机空间平移；提出Metric-Aware HMR网络，包含相机分支和相对度量损失。

Result: 构建了DTO-Humans数据集（56万张高质量场景一致图像），在相对深度推理和人体网格恢复方面达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: DTO方法有效解决了多人场景一致性，Metric-Aware HMR网络实现了度量尺度的人体网格恢复，为多人人体网格恢复提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-person human mesh recovery from a single image is a challenging task, hindered by the scarcity of in-the-wild training data. Prevailing in-the-wild human mesh pseudo-ground-truth (pGT) generation pipelines are single-person-centric, where each human is processed individually without joint optimization. This oversight leads to a lack of scene-level consistency, producing individuals with conflicting depths and scales within the same image. To address this, we introduce Depth-conditioned Translation Optimization (DTO), a novel optimization-based method that jointly refines the camera-space translations of all individuals in a crowd. By leveraging anthropometric priors on human height and depth cues from a monocular depth estimator, DTO solves for a scene-consistent placement of all subjects within a principled Maximum a posteriori (MAP) framework. Applying DTO to the 4D-Humans dataset, we construct DTO-Humans, a new large-scale pGT dataset of 0.56M high-quality, scene-consistent multi-person images, featuring dense crowds with an average of 4.8 persons per image. Furthermore, we propose Metric-Aware HMR, an end-to-end network that directly estimates human mesh and camera parameters in metric scale. This is enabled by a camera branch and a novel relative metric loss that enforces plausible relative scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on relative depth reasoning and human mesh recovery. Code and data will be released publicly.

Conclusion: TabFlash通过结合渐进式问题条件化、剪枝和token聚焦，实现了高效且有效的表格理解，证明了针对表格图像特点定制方法的重要性。

Abstract: Table images present unique challenges for effective and efficient understanding due to the need for question-specific focus and the presence of redundant background regions. Existing Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) approaches often overlook these characteristics, resulting in uninformative and redundant visual representations. To address these issues, we aim to generate visual features that are both informative and compact to improve table understanding. We first propose progressive question conditioning, which injects the question into Vision Transformer layers with gradually increasing frequency, considering each layer's capacity to handle additional information, to generate question-aware visual features. To reduce redundancy, we introduce a pruning strategy that discards background tokens, thereby improving efficiency. To mitigate information loss from pruning, we further propose token focusing, a training strategy that encourages the model to concentrate essential information in the retained tokens. By combining these approaches, we present TabFlash, an efficient and effective MLLM for table understanding. TabFlash achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both open-source and proprietary MLLMs, while requiring 27% less FLOPs and 30% less memory usage compared to the second-best MLLM.

Conclusion: 这项工作弥合了通用图像编辑和专业级字体设计之间的差距，为专业设计工作流程提供了强大的工具。

Abstract: Artistic design such as poster design often demands rapid yet precise modification of textual content while preserving visual harmony and typographic intent, especially across diverse font styles. Although modern image editing models have grown increasingly powerful, they still fall short in fine-grained, font-aware text manipulation, limiting their utility in professional design workflows such as poster editing. To address this issue, we present SkyReels-Text, a novel font-controllable framework for precise poster text editing. Our method enables simultaneous editing of multiple text regions, each rendered in distinct typographic styles, while preserving the visual appearance of non-edited regions. Notably, our model requires neither font labels nor fine-tuning during inference: users can simply provide cropped glyph patches corresponding to their desired typography, even if the font is not included in any standard library. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, including handwrittent text benchmarks, SkyReels-Text achieves state-of-the-art performance in both text fidelity and visual realism, offering unprecedented control over font families, and stylistic nuances. This work bridges the gap between general-purpose image editing and professional-grade typographic design.

Abstract: End-to-end planning methods are the de facto standard of the current autonomous driving system, while the robustness of the data-driven approaches suffers due to the notorious long-tail problem (i.e., rare but safety-critical failure cases). In this work, we explore whether recent diffusion-based video generation methods (a.k.a. world models), paired with structured 3D layouts, can enable a fully automated pipeline to self-correct such failure cases. We first introduce an agent to simulate the role of product manager, dubbed PM-Agent, which formulates data requirements to collect data similar to the failure cases. Then, we use a generative model that can simulate both data collection and annotation. However, existing generative models struggle to generate high-fidelity data conditioned on 3D layouts. To address this, we propose DriveSora, which can generate spatiotemporally consistent videos aligned with the 3D annotations requested by PM-Agent. We integrate these components into our self-correcting agentic system, CorrectAD. Importantly, our pipeline is an end-to-end model-agnostic and can be applied to improve any end-to-end planner. Evaluated on both nuScenes and a more challenging in-house dataset across multiple end-to-end planners, CorrectAD corrects 62.5% and 49.8% of failure cases, reducing collision rates by 39% and 27%, respectively.

Abstract: The generation of realistic LiDAR point clouds plays a crucial role in the development and evaluation of autonomous driving systems. Although recent methods for 3D LiDAR point cloud generation have shown significant improvements, they still face notable limitations, including the lack of sequential generation capabilities and the inability to produce accurately positioned foreground objects and realistic backgrounds. These shortcomings hinder their practical applicability. In this paper, we introduce DriveLiDAR4D, a novel LiDAR generation pipeline consisting of multimodal conditions and a novel sequential noise prediction model LiDAR4DNet, capable of producing temporally consistent LiDAR scenes with highly controllable foreground objects and realistic backgrounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address the sequential generation of LiDAR scenes with full scene manipulation capability in an end-to-end manner. We evaluated DriveLiDAR4D on the nuScenes and KITTI datasets, where we achieved an FRD score of 743.13 and an FVD score of 16.96 on the nuScenes dataset, surpassing the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, UniScene, with an performance boost of 37.2% in FRD and 24.1% in FVD, respectively.

Motivation: 现有农田边界提取方法存在边界不完整、相邻地块合并、难以扩展等问题，需要开发可扩展的精准农田边界制图方法。

Method: 基于YOLOv11骨干网络构建DelAny实例分割模型，在FBIS 22M数据集上训练，结合结构化后处理、合并和矢量化流程生成拓扑一致的矢量边界。

Result: DelAny模型比SAM2准确率提升100%以上，推理速度快400倍；在乌克兰应用中提取了375万（5米分辨率）和515万（2.5米分辨率）个农田，远超现有产品。

Conclusion: DelAnyFlow为缺乏数字地籍数据的地区提供了可扩展、经济高效的农田边界制图解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate delineation of agricultural field boundaries from satellite imagery is essential for land management and crop monitoring, yet existing methods often produce incomplete boundaries, merge adjacent fields, and struggle to scale. We present the Delineate Anything Flow (DelAnyFlow) methodology, a resolution-agnostic approach for large-scale field boundary mapping. DelAnyFlow combines the DelAny instance segmentation model, based on a YOLOv11 backbone and trained on the large-scale Field Boundary Instance Segmentation-22M (FBIS 22M) dataset, with a structured post-processing, merging, and vectorization sequence to generate topologically consistent vector boundaries. FBIS 22M, the largest dataset of its kind, contains 672,909 multi-resolution image patches (0.25-10m) and 22.9million validated field instances. The DelAny model delivers state-of-the-art accuracy with over 100% higher mAP and 400x faster inference than SAM2. DelAny demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization and supports national-scale applications: using Sentinel 2 data for 2024, DelAnyFlow generated a complete field boundary layer for Ukraine (603,000km2) in under six hours on a single workstation. DelAnyFlow outputs significantly improve boundary completeness relative to operational products from Sinergise Solutions and NASA Harvest, particularly in smallholder and fragmented systems (0.25-1ha). For Ukraine, DelAnyFlow delineated 3.75M fields at 5m and 5.15M at 2.5m, compared to 2.66M detected by Sinergise Solutions and 1.69M by NASA Harvest. This work delivers a scalable, cost-effective methodology for field delineation in regions lacking digital cadastral data.

### [272] [VOPE: Revisiting Hallucination of Vision-Language Models in Voluntary Imagination Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13420)
*Xingming Long,Jie Zhang,Shiguang Shan,Xilin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了VOPE方法，用于评估大型视觉语言模型在自愿想象任务中的幻觉问题，发现现有模型在想象任务中普遍存在严重幻觉，且现有幻觉缓解方法效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注禁止输出图像中不存在内容的事实描述任务，而忽视了自愿想象任务（如故事创作）中的幻觉问题，这些任务中模型需要生成超越给定图像的新内容。

Method: 提出VOPE方法，通过提出重新检查式问题来评估LVLM如何解释其响应中想象对象的存在性，根据模型解释与图像中对象存在性的一致性来判断是否产生幻觉。

Result: 应用VOPE评估主流LVLM和幻觉缓解方法发现：大多数LVLM在自愿想象中严重幻觉，对想象对象的存在性评估表现很差；现有幻觉缓解方法在自愿想象任务中效果有限。

Conclusion: 自愿想象任务中的幻觉问题是一个重要的研究方向，现有方法对此类幻觉的缓解效果不佳，需要进一步研究。

Abstract: Most research on hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) focuses on factual description tasks that prohibit any output absent from the image. However, little attention has been paid to hallucinations in voluntary imagination tasks, e.g., story writing, where the models are expected to generate novel content beyond the given image. In these tasks, it is inappropriate to simply regard such imagined novel content as hallucinations. To address this limitation, we introduce Voluntary-imagined Object Presence Evaluation (VOPE)-a novel method to assess LVLMs' hallucinations in voluntary imagination tasks via presence evaluation. Specifically, VOPE poses recheck-based questions to evaluate how an LVLM interprets the presence of the imagined objects in its own response. The consistency between the model's interpretation and the object's presence in the image is then used to determine whether the model hallucinates when generating the response. We apply VOPE to several mainstream LVLMs and hallucination mitigation methods, revealing two key findings: (1) most LVLMs hallucinate heavily during voluntary imagination, and their performance in presence evaluation is notably poor on imagined objects; (2) existing hallucination mitigation methods show limited effect in voluntary imagination tasks, making this an important direction for future research.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了可逆且模态无关的形状映射表示，在多种3D几何处理任务中展现出强大潜力

Abstract: We introduce a novel neural representation for maps between 3D shapes based on flow-matching models, which is computationally efficient and supports cross-representation shape matching without large-scale training or data-driven procedures. 3D shapes are represented as the probability distribution induced by a continuous and invertible flow mapping from a fixed anchor distribution. Given a source and a target shape, the composition of the inverse flow (source to anchor) with the forward flow (anchor to target), we continuously map points between the two surfaces. By encoding the shapes with a pointwise task-tailored embedding, this construction provides an invertible and modality-agnostic representation of maps between shapes across point clouds, meshes, signed distance fields (SDFs), and volumetric data. The resulting representation consistently achieves high coverage and accuracy across diverse benchmarks and challenging settings in shape matching. Beyond shape matching, our framework shows promising results in other tasks, including UV mapping and registration of raw point cloud scans of human bodies.

TL;DR: InterMoE是一个基于动态时间选择性专家混合框架，用于生成高质量3D人体交互动作，通过结合高层文本语义和低层运动上下文的路由机制，在保持个体特征的同时确保语义保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成人体交互时难以同时保持个体特征和文本描述的准确性，需要一种能兼顾个体特性和语义保真的解决方案。

Method: 采用动态时间选择性专家混合框架，通过路由机制将时间运动特征分配给专门专家，专家动态确定选择能力并关注关键时间特征。

Result: 在InterHuman数据集上FID分数降低9%，在InterX数据集上降低22%，实现了最先进的个体特异性高保真3D人体交互生成性能。

Conclusion: InterMoE框架通过动态专家选择和特征路由，成功解决了保持个体特征和语义保真度的双重挑战，在人体交互生成任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Generating high-quality human interactions holds significant value for applications like virtual reality and robotics. However, existing methods often fail to preserve unique individual characteristics or fully adhere to textual descriptions. To address these challenges, we introduce InterMoE, a novel framework built on a Dynamic Temporal-Selective Mixture of Experts. The core of InterMoE is a routing mechanism that synergistically uses both high-level text semantics and low-level motion context to dispatch temporal motion features to specialized experts. This allows experts to dynamically determine the selection capacity and focus on critical temporal features, thereby preserving specific individual characteristic identities while ensuring high semantic fidelity. Extensive experiments show that InterMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance in individual-specific high-fidelity 3D human interaction generation, reducing FID scores by 9% on the InterHuman dataset and 22% on InterX.

TL;DR: LGIP基准测试评估视觉语言模型对语义保持改写和语义改变翻转的鲁棒性，发现EVA02-CLIP和大型OpenCLIP变体在不变性和敏感性方面表现最佳，而SigLIP模型存在较大问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估视觉语言模型在受控语言扰动下的鲁棒性，特别是对语义保持改写的不变性和对语义改变翻转的敏感性，这些特性在标准检索指标中难以体现。

Method: 使用40k MS COCO图像和人工标注，自动生成语义保持的改写和基于规则的语义翻转（改变对象类别、颜色或数量），通过不变性误差、语义敏感性差距和正率统计来总结模型行为。

Result: EVA02-CLIP和大型OpenCLIP变体在不变性-敏感性边界上表现最佳，而SigLIP和SigLIP2显示出较大的不变性误差，且经常偏好翻转后的描述而非原始人类描述。

Conclusion: LGIP提供了一个模型无关的诊断工具，能够揭示视觉语言模型在语言鲁棒性方面的问题，这些问题在传统检索指标中是不可见的。

Abstract: Recent vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, OpenCLIP, EVA02-CLIP and SigLIP achieve strong zero-shot performance, but it is unclear how reliably they respond to controlled linguistic perturbations. We introduce Language-Guided Invariance Probing (LGIP), a benchmark that measures (i) invariance to meaning-preserving paraphrases and (ii) sensitivity to meaning-changing semantic flips in image-text matching. Using 40k MS COCO images with five human captions each, we automatically generate paraphrases and rule-based flips that alter object category, color or count, and summarize model behavior with an invariance error, a semantic sensitivity gap and a positive-rate statistic.
  Across nine VLMs, EVA02-CLIP and large OpenCLIP variants lie on a favorable invariance-sensitivity frontier, combining low paraphrase-induced variance with consistently higher scores for original captions than for their flipped counterparts. In contrast, SigLIP and SigLIP2 show much larger invariance error and often prefer flipped captions to the human descriptions, especially for object and color edits. These failures are largely invisible to standard retrieval metrics, indicating that LGIP provides a model-agnostic diagnostic for the linguistic robustness of VLMs beyond conventional accuracy scores.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中国城中村经历了大规模拆迁改造，但缺乏对拆迁土地是否有效再利用的系统评估，需要评估当前改造实践的效能和可持续性。

Method: 使用多时相遥感影像进行语义分割来绘制城中村边界变化，并将拆迁后土地利用分为六类：不完全拆迁、闲置土地、建筑工地、建筑物、绿地和其他。选取广州、郑州、西安和哈尔滨四个代表性城市作为研究区域。

Conclusion: 城中村改造具有碎片化、复杂性和非线性特征，需要分层级和因地制宜的规划策略。研究结果为支持更包容、高效和可持续的城市更新提供了实证见解。

Abstract: Urban villages (UVs), informal settlements embedded within China's urban fabric, have undergone widespread demolition and redevelopment in recent decades. However, there remains a lack of systematic evaluation of whether the demolished land has been effectively reused, raising concerns about the efficacy and sustainability of current redevelopment practices. To address the gap, this study proposes a deep learning-based framework to monitor the spatiotemporal changes of UVs in China. Specifically, semantic segmentation of multi-temporal remote sensing imagery is first used to map evolving UV boundaries, and then post-demolition land use is classified into six categories based on the "remained-demolished-redeveloped" phase: incomplete demolition, vacant land, construction sites, buildings, green spaces, and others. Four representative cities from China's four economic regions were selected as the study areas, i.e., Guangzhou (East), Zhengzhou (Central), Xi'an (West), and Harbin (Northeast). The results indicate: 1) UV redevelopment processes were frequently prolonged; 2) redevelopment transitions primarily occurred in peripheral areas, whereas urban cores remained relatively stable; and 3) three spatiotemporal transformation pathways, i.e., synchronized redevelopment, delayed redevelopment, and gradual optimization, were revealed. This study highlights the fragmented, complex and nonlinear nature of UV redevelopment, underscoring the need for tiered and context-sensitive planning strategies. By linking spatial dynamics with the context of redevelopment policies, the findings offer valuable empirical insights that support more inclusive, efficient, and sustainable urban renewal, while also contributing to a broader global understanding of informal settlement transformations.

Abstract: In ill-posed imaging inverse problems, uncertainty quantification remains a fundamental challenge, especially in safety-critical applications. Recently, conformal prediction has been used to quantify the uncertainty that the inverse problem contributes to downstream tasks like image classification, image quality assessment, fat mass quantification, etc. While existing works handle only a scalar estimation target, practical applications often involve multiple targets. In response, we propose an asymptotically minimax approach to multi-target conformal prediction that provides tight prediction intervals while ensuring joint marginal coverage. We then outline how our minimax approach can be applied to multi-metric blind image quality assessment, multi-task uncertainty quantification, and multi-round measurement acquisition. Finally, we numerically demonstrate the benefits of our minimax method, relative to existing multi-target conformal prediction methods, using both synthetic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的攻击方法，通过联邦学习中的微小颜色扰动来破坏模型的可解释性，同时保持预测准确性不变。这种攻击使显著性图偏离语义相关区域，挑战了正确预测即代表忠实解释的常见假设。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型在安全关键领域的部署增加，可视化解释技术对透明度支持变得至关重要。本文揭示了一类新的攻击，这些攻击在不影响准确性的情况下损害模型的可解释性。

Method: 提出了色度扰动模块，通过系统性地改变前景和背景之间的颜色对比度来制作对抗样本，从而破坏解释的忠实度。这些扰动在训练轮次中累积，以隐蔽且持久的方式毒化全局模型的内部特征归因。

Result: 攻击将Grad-CAM解释中的峰值激活重叠减少了高达35%，同时在所有评估数据集上保持分类准确率超过96%。标准训练流程不足以检测或减轻解释退化。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，可解释性本身可以成为攻击面，挑战了模型审计中正确预测意味着忠实解释的常见假设。联邦学习设置中微妙的颜色扰动更难被察觉，使得这种攻击更加隐蔽。

Abstract: As machine learning models are increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains, visual explanation techniques have become essential tools for supporting transparency. In this work, we reveal a new class of attacks that compromise model interpretability without affecting accuracy. Specifically, we show that small color perturbations applied by adversarial clients in a federated learning setting can shift a model's saliency maps away from semantically meaningful regions while keeping the prediction unchanged. The proposed saliency-aware attack framework, called Chromatic Perturbation Module, systematically crafts adversarial examples by altering the color contrast between foreground and background in a way that disrupts explanation fidelity. These perturbations accumulate across training rounds, poisoning the global model's internal feature attributions in a stealthy and persistent manner. Our findings challenge a common assumption in model auditing that correct predictions imply faithful explanations and demonstrate that interpretability itself can be an attack surface. We evaluate this vulnerability across multiple datasets and show that standard training pipelines are insufficient to detect or mitigate explanation degradation, especially in the federated learning setting, where subtle color perturbations are harder to discern. Our attack reduces peak activation overlap in Grad-CAM explanations by up to 35% while preserving classification accuracy above 96% on all evaluated datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的OOD检测器在处理与ID类别语义相似的OOD样本时表现不佳，需要一种能够专门处理语义挑战性OOD样本的检测方法。

Method: 通过ID表示的简单变换合成伪OOD特征，利用神经崩溃现象，引入基于特征范数的轻量级辅助头进行半径分类，将OOD检测与主分类器解耦。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet-200上的实验表明，BootOOD优于先验的后处理方法，在没有异常暴露的情况下超越了基于训练的方法，并与最先进的异常暴露方法竞争，同时保持或提高了ID准确率。

Conclusion: BootOOD提供了一种有效的自监督OOD检测解决方案，特别适用于处理语义相似的OOD样本，且无需外部OOD数据。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for deploying image classifiers in safety-sensitive environments, yet existing detectors often struggle when OOD samples are semantically similar to the in-distribution (ID) classes. We present BootOOD, a fully self-supervised OOD detection framework that bootstraps exclusively from ID data and is explicitly designed to handle semantically challenging OOD samples. BootOOD synthesizes pseudo-OOD features through simple transformations of ID representations and leverages Neural Collapse (NC), where ID features cluster tightly around class means with consistent feature norms. Unlike prior approaches that aim to constrain OOD features into subspaces orthogonal to the collapsed ID means, BootOOD introduces a lightweight auxiliary head that performs radius-based classification on feature norms. This design decouples OOD detection from the primary classifier and imposes a relaxed requirement: OOD samples are learned to have smaller feature norms than ID features, which is easier to satisfy when ID and OOD are semantically close. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-200 show that BootOOD outperforms prior post-hoc methods, surpasses training-based methods without outlier exposure, and is competitive with state-of-the-art outlier-exposure approaches while maintaining or improving ID accuracy.

Conclusion: 提出的TSE-Net框架能够有效利用未标注数据，通过半监督学习提升单目高度估计的性能，解决了标注数据稀缺的问题。

Abstract: Monocular height estimation plays a critical role in 3D perception for remote sensing, offering a cost-effective alternative to multi-view or LiDAR-based methods. While deep learning has significantly advanced the capabilities of monocular height estimation, these methods remain fundamentally limited by the availability of labeled data, which are expensive and labor-intensive to obtain at scale. The scarcity of high-quality annotations hinders the generalization and performance of existing models. To overcome this limitation, we propose leveraging large volumes of unlabeled data through a semi-supervised learning framework, enabling the model to extract informative cues from unlabeled samples and improve its predictive performance. In this work, we introduce TSE-Net, a self-training pipeline for semi-supervised monocular height estimation. The pipeline integrates teacher, student, and exam networks. The student network is trained on unlabeled data using pseudo-labels generated by the teacher network, while the exam network functions as a temporal ensemble of the student network to stabilize performance. The teacher network is formulated as a joint regression and classification model: the regression branch predicts height values that serve as pseudo-labels, and the classification branch predicts height value classes along with class probabilities, which are used to filter pseudo-labels. Height value classes are defined using a hierarchical bi-cut strategy to address the inherent long-tailed distribution of heights, and the predicted class probabilities are calibrated with a Plackett-Luce model to reflect the expected accuracy of pseudo-labels. We evaluate the proposed pipeline on three datasets spanning different resolutions and imaging modalities. Codes are available at https://github.com/zhu-xlab/tse-net.

Conclusion: Opt3DGS通过改进3DGS的优化过程，有效解决了其优化挑战，提升了渲染质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a leading framework for novel view synthesis, yet its core optimization challenges remain underexplored. We identify two key issues in 3DGS optimization: entrapment in suboptimal local optima and insufficient convergence quality. To address these, we propose Opt3DGS, a robust framework that enhances 3DGS through a two-stage optimization process of adaptive exploration and curvature-guided exploitation. In the exploration phase, an Adaptive Weighted Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) method enhances global search to escape local optima. In the exploitation phase, a Local Quasi-Newton Direction-guided Adam optimizer leverages curvature information for precise and efficient convergence. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that Opt3DGS achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality by refining the 3DGS optimization process without modifying its underlying representation.

Method: NuClass包含两个主要组件：Path local（关注224x224像素裁剪的核形态）和Path global（建模1024x1024像素邻域的周围环境），通过可学习门控模块自适应平衡局部细节和上下文线索，并采用不确定性引导目标促进互补学习。

Result: 在三个完全保留的队列上评估，NuClass最佳类别F1得分高达96%，优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 多尺度、不确定性感知的融合可以弥合幻灯片级病理基础模型与可靠细胞级表型预测之间的差距。

Abstract: Identifying cell types and subtypes from routine histopathology images is essential for improving the computational understanding of human disease. Existing tile-based models can capture detailed nuclear morphology but often fail to incorporate the broader tissue context that influences a cell's function and identity. In addition, available human annotations are typically coarse-grained and unevenly distributed across studies, making fine-grained subtype-level supervision difficult to obtain.
  To address these limitations, we introduce NuClass, a pathologist workflow inspired framework for cell-wise multi-scale integration of nuclear morphology and microenvironmental context. NuClass includes two main components: Path local, which focuses on nuclear morphology from 224-by-224 pixel crops, and Path global, which models the surrounding 1024-by-1024 pixel neighborhood. A learnable gating module adaptively balances local detail and contextual cues. To encourage complementary learning, we incorporate an uncertainty-guided objective that directs the global path to prioritize regions where the local path is uncertain. We also provide calibrated confidence estimates and Grad-CAM visualizations to enhance interpretability.
  To overcome the lack of high-quality annotations, we construct a marker-guided dataset from Xenium spatial transcriptomics assays, yielding single-cell resolution labels for more than two million cells across eight organs and 16 classes. Evaluated on three fully held-out cohorts, NuClass achieves up to 96 percent F1 for its best-performing class, outperforming strong baselines. Our results show that multi-scale, uncertainty-aware fusion can bridge the gap between slide-level pathological foundation models and reliable, cell-level phenotype prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HVI色彩空间在低光图像增强中取得进展，但色度和亮度分支间的分布差异限制了互补特征提取，亮度误差通过非线性参数传播到色度通道；大均匀色区域中色度分支间相关性弱，传统像素级损失导致梯度冲突

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验结果表明，提出的ICLR框架优于最先进的方法

Conclusion: ICLR框架有效解决了低光图像增强中色度和亮度交互的挑战，通过DIEM模块和CCL损失实现了更好的性能

Abstract: Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) task aims at improving contrast while restoring details and textures for images captured in low-light conditions. HVI color space has made significant progress in this task by enabling precise decoupling of chrominance and luminance. However, for the interaction of chrominance and luminance branches, substantial distributional differences between the two branches prevalent in natural images limit complementary feature extraction, and luminance errors are propagated to chrominance channels through the nonlinear parameter. Furthermore, for interaction between different chrominance branches, images with large homogeneous-color regions usually exhibit weak correlation between chrominance branches due to concentrated distributions. Traditional pixel-wise losses exploit strong inter-branch correlations for co-optimization, causing gradient conflicts in weakly correlated regions. Therefore, we propose an Inter-Chrominance and Luminance Interaction (ICLR) framework including a Dual-stream Interaction Enhancement Module (DIEM) and a Covariance Correction Loss (CCL). The DIEM improves the extraction of complementary information from two dimensions, fusion and enhancement, respectively. The CCL utilizes luminance residual statistics to penalize chrominance errors and balances gradient conflicts by constraining chrominance branches covariance. Experimental results on multiple datasets show that the proposed ICLR framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Deformable templates, or atlases, are images that represent a prototypical anatomy for a population, and are often enhanced with probabilistic anatomical label maps. They are commonly used in medical image analysis for population studies and computational anatomy tasks such as registration and segmentation. Because developing a template is a computationally expensive process, relatively few templates are available. As a result, analysis is often conducted with sub-optimal templates that are not truly representative of the study population, especially when there are large variations within this population. We propose a machine learning framework that uses convolutional registration neural networks to efficiently learn a function that outputs templates conditioned on subject-specific attributes, such as age and sex. We also leverage segmentations, when available, to produce anatomical segmentation maps for the resulting templates. The learned network can also be used to register subject images to the templates. We demonstrate our method on a compilation of 3D brain MRI datasets, and show that it can learn high-quality templates that are representative of populations. We find that annotated conditional templates enable better registration than their unlabeled unconditional counterparts, and outperform other templates construction methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖详细专家标注且组织上下文利用不足，需要减少标注负担并提高组织依赖性细胞类型的检测精度

Method: 结合ConvNeXt编码器-解码器与冻结Virchow-2组织分割分支，通过多尺度空间特征线性调制选择性调节分类流

Result: 在PUMA基准上超越组织不可知基线和掩码监督方法，在组织依赖性细胞类型（上皮、内皮、基质）上表现显著提升

Conclusion: 这是首个基于学习组织掩码进行单细胞分类的方法，为减少标注负担提供了实用途径

Abstract: Accurate nuclei detection and classification are fundamental to computational pathology, yet existing approaches are hindered by reliance on detailed expert annotations and insufficient use of tissue context. We present Tissue-Aware Nuclei Detection (TAND), a novel framework achieving joint nuclei detection and classification using point-level supervision enhanced by tissue mask conditioning. TAND couples a ConvNeXt-based encoder-decoder with a frozen Virchow-2 tissue segmentation branch, where semantic tissue probabilities selectively modulate the classification stream through a novel multi-scale Spatial Feature-wise Linear Modulation (Spatial-FiLM). On the PUMA benchmark, TAND achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing both tissue-agnostic baselines and mask-supervised methods. Notably, our approach demonstrates remarkable improvements in tissue-dependent cell types such as epithelium, endothelium, and stroma. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to condition per-cell classification on learned tissue masks, offering a practical pathway to reduce annotation burden.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 驾驶员疲劳是导致道路事故的主要原因之一，每年造成大量伤亡，需要开发有效的监测系统来提高道路安全

Method: 使用标准网络摄像头，结合MediaPipe Face Mesh框架和Eye Aspect Ratio(EAR)方法，实时追踪驾驶员面部特征和眼部运动，检测长时间闭眼和低眨眼频率

Result: 实验分析表明系统具有高准确性和快速响应能力，能够有效检测疲劳状态

Conclusion: 该系统提供了一种高性能、低成本的驾驶员监控解决方案，可作为先进驾驶辅助系统(ADAS)的组成部分

Abstract: One of the major causes of road accidents is driver fatigue that causes thousands of fatalities and injuries every year. This study shows development of a Driver Drowsiness Detection System meant to improve the safety of the road by alerting drivers who are showing signs of being drowsy. The system is based on a standard webcam that tracks the facial features of the driver with the main emphasis on the examination of eye movements that can be conducted with the help of the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) method. The Face Mesh by MediaPipe is a lightweight framework that can identify facial landmarks with high accuracy and efficiency, which is considered to be important in real time use. The system detects the moments of long eye shutdowns or a very low rate of blinking which are manifestations of drowsiness and alerts the driver through sound to get her attention back. This system achieves a high-performance and low-cost driver monitoring solution with the help of the computational power of OpenCV to process the image and the MediaPipe to identify faces. Test data experimental analyses indicate that the system is very accurate and responds quicker; this confirms that it can be a component of the current Advanced Driving Assistance System (ADAS).

*Shrenik Patel,Daivik Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CacheFlow是一种无需训练的视频问答方法，通过动态令牌丢弃和压缩长期记忆机制，显著减少处理令牌数量（最多87%），同时保持长范围推理能力，适用于实时流媒体视频问答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在处理长视频问答时面临注意力机制和键值缓存随运行时间增长的挑战，导致推理成本高昂或只能使用短视的滑动窗口方法。

Method: 结合动态令牌丢弃（基于与前一帧的余弦相似度在线修剪每帧令牌）和压缩长期记忆（将幸存令牌打包成固定大小块，使用小型循环编码器构建检索索引，并在生成时重新加载完整键值对）。

Result: 在离线和流媒体视频问答基准测试中，CacheFlow优于当前强基线方法，同时处理令牌数量减少高达87%。

Conclusion: CacheFlow的双重方法使视觉语言模型既高效又具备上下文感知能力，为实用的长视频理解铺平了道路。

Abstract: Long-form video question answering (VQA) overwhelms current vision-language models (VLMs) because attention and key-value (KV) caches grow with runtime, forcing either expensive inference or near-sighted sliding windows. We introduce CacheFlow, a training-free pipeline that pairs Dynamic Token Dropping (DTD) with a compressive long-term memory. DTD prunes per-patch tokens online via cosine similarity to the previous frame, and surviving tokens are packed into fixed-size blocks. This online, per-frame processing makes our approach fundamentally suited for live streaming VQA. As blocks are processed, each one's keys are summarized by a tiny recurrent encoder to form a retrieval index, while the block's full KV pairs are offloaded and later rehydrated for generation, preserving answer fidelity. At inference, a consensus-based retrieval mechanism retrieves only the Top-K most relevant blocks and attends over both the retrieved and local context for precise, long-range reasoning. CacheFlow is drop-in, architecture-agnostic, and requires no fine-tuning. Experiments on both offline and streaming VQA benchmarks demonstrate that CacheFlow outperforms current strong baselines, while processing up to 87% less tokens. Our dual approach enables VLMs to be both efficient and context-aware, paving the way for practical long-form video understanding.

TL;DR: Part-X-MLLM是一个原生3D多模态大语言模型，通过结构化可执行语法将多样3D任务统一为程序，能够从RGB点云和自然语言提示生成包含部件级边界框、语义描述和编辑命令的连贯输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D任务中缺乏统一接口的问题，通过将符号规划与几何合成解耦，使任何兼容的几何引擎都能通过单一语言前端进行控制。

Method: 采用双编码器架构进行预训练，分离结构与语义，并在大规模部件中心数据集上进行指令调优，生成结构化可执行程序作为统一接口。

Result: 模型在生成高质量结构化规划方面表现出色，在基于问答、组合生成和局部编辑等任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Part-X-MLLM通过结构化程序接口成功统一了多样3D任务，为3D几何引擎提供了灵活的语言控制前端。

Abstract: We introduce Part-X-MLLM, a native 3D multimodal large language model that unifies diverse 3D tasks by formulating them as programs in a structured, executable grammar. Given an RGB point cloud and a natural language prompt, our model autoregressively generates a single, coherent token sequence encoding part-level bounding boxes, semantic descriptions, and edit commands. This structured output serves as a versatile interface to drive downstream geometry-aware modules for part-based generation and editing. By decoupling the symbolic planning from the geometric synthesis, our approach allows any compatible geometry engine to be controlled through a single, language-native frontend. We pre-train a dual-encoder architecture to disentangle structure from semantics and instruction-tune the model on a large-scale, part-centric dataset. Experiments demonstrate that our model excels at producing high-quality, structured plans, enabling state-of-the-art performance in grounded Q\&A, compositional generation, and localized editing through one unified interface.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D生成方法大多忽略了关键的物理和关节属性，限制了在具身AI中的应用。需要将3D建模从静态视觉表示转向可直接用于仿真和交互的物理化、可关节化资产。

Method: 提出了首个基于VLM的物理3D生成模型，以及新的3D表示方法，将几何token数量减少193倍。构建了PhysX-Mobility数据集，包含2000多个常见真实世界物体，类别比现有物理3D数据集扩展2倍以上。

Conclusion: PhysX-Anything能够显著赋能下游应用，特别是在具身AI和基于物理的仿真领域，为3D生成向物理化、可交互化方向发展提供了重要推动。

Abstract: 3D modeling is shifting from static visual representations toward physical, articulated assets that can be directly used in simulation and interaction. However, most existing 3D generation methods overlook key physical and articulation properties, thereby limiting their utility in embodied AI. To bridge this gap, we introduce PhysX-Anything, the first simulation-ready physical 3D generative framework that, given a single in-the-wild image, produces high-quality sim-ready 3D assets with explicit geometry, articulation, and physical attributes. Specifically, we propose the first VLM-based physical 3D generative model, along with a new 3D representation that efficiently tokenizes geometry. It reduces the number of tokens by 193x, enabling explicit geometry learning within standard VLM token budgets without introducing any special tokens during fine-tuning and significantly improving generative quality. In addition, to overcome the limited diversity of existing physical 3D datasets, we construct a new dataset, PhysX-Mobility, which expands the object categories in prior physical 3D datasets by over 2x and includes more than 2K common real-world objects with rich physical annotations. Extensive experiments on PhysX-Mobility and in-the-wild images demonstrate that PhysX-Anything delivers strong generative performance and robust generalization. Furthermore, simulation-based experiments in a MuJoCo-style environment validate that our sim-ready assets can be directly used for contact-rich robotic policy learning. We believe PhysX-Anything can substantially empower a broad range of downstream applications, especially in embodied AI and physics-based simulation.

Method: 将强化学习融入蒸馏过程，使用DMD损失作为正则化，结合动态分布引导和动态重噪声采样训练策略

Result: 在少步方法中达到领先的视觉质量和提示一致性，性能甚至超过多步教师模型

Conclusion: DMDR框架成功解锁了少步生成器的能力，实现了蒸馏与强化学习的协同优化

Abstract: Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) distills a pre-trained multi-step diffusion model to a few-step one to improve inference efficiency. However, the performance of the latter is often capped by the former. To circumvent this dilemma, we propose DMDR, a novel framework that combines Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques into the distillation process. We show that for the RL of the few-step generator, the DMD loss itself is a more effective regularization compared to the traditional ones. In turn, RL can help to guide the mode coverage process in DMD more effectively. These allow us to unlock the capacity of the few-step generator by conducting distillation and RL simultaneously. Meanwhile, we design the dynamic distribution guidance and dynamic renoise sampling training strategies to improve the initial distillation process. The experiments demonstrate that DMDR can achieve leading visual quality, prompt coherence among few-step methods, and even exhibit performance that exceeds the multi-step teacher.

TL;DR: GS-Light是一个基于高斯泼溅的文本引导3D场景重光照系统，通过训练免费的扩散模型扩展来处理多视图输入，结合几何语义信息和光照先验生成高质量重光照结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在文本引导的3D场景重光照方面存在局限性，特别是在准确理解用户对光照方向、颜色和强度的要求方面。需要一种能够有效解析文本提示并生成符合预期光照效果的解决方案。

Method: 使用大视觉语言模型解析文本提示为光照先验，结合几何语义估计器（深度、法线、语义分割）生成光照图，通过多视图重光照模型生成高质量重光照图像，最后微调3D高斯泼溅场景。

Result: 在室内外场景评估中，GS-Light在定量指标（多视图一致性、图像质量、美学评分、语义相似度）和定性评估（用户研究）上均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: GS-Light提供了一种高效、文本位置感知的3D场景重光照方法，能够准确理解用户意图并生成高质量的重光照结果，在多个评估维度上优于现有技术。

Abstract: We introduce GS-Light, an efficient, textual position-aware pipeline for text-guided relighting of 3D scenes represented via Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). GS-Light implements a training-free extension of a single-input diffusion model to handle multi-view inputs. Given a user prompt that may specify lighting direction, color, intensity, or reference objects, we employ a large vision-language model (LVLM) to parse the prompt into lighting priors. Using off-the-shelf estimators for geometry and semantics (depth, surface normals, and semantic segmentation), we fuse these lighting priors with view-geometry constraints to compute illumination maps and generate initial latent codes for each view. These meticulously derived init latents guide the diffusion model to generate relighting outputs that more accurately reflect user expectations, especially in terms of lighting direction. By feeding multi-view rendered images, along with the init latents, into our multi-view relighting model, we produce high-fidelity, artistically relit images. Finally, we fine-tune the 3DGS scene with the relit appearance to obtain a fully relit 3D scene. We evaluate GS-Light on both indoor and outdoor scenes, comparing it to state-of-the-art baselines including per-view relighting, video relighting, and scene editing methods. Using quantitative metrics (multi-view consistency, imaging quality, aesthetic score, semantic similarity, etc.) and qualitative assessment (user studies), GS-Light demonstrates consistent improvements over baselines. Code and assets will be made available upon publication.

TL;DR: 提出了TiViBench基准来评估图像到视频生成模型的推理能力，并开发了VideoTPO测试时优化策略来提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型主要关注视觉保真度和时间一致性，缺乏对高阶推理能力的评估，需要专门的基准来填补这一空白。

Method: 设计了TiViBench分层基准，从四个维度评估推理能力：结构推理与搜索、空间与视觉模式推理、符号与逻辑推理、动作规划与任务执行。同时提出了VideoTPO测试时优化策略，通过LLM自分析来改进生成质量。

Result: 商业模型（如Sora 2、Veo 3.1）显示出更强的推理潜力，开源模型因训练规模和数据多样性限制而潜力未充分释放。VideoTPO能显著提升推理性能，无需额外训练、数据或奖励模型。

Conclusion: TiViBench和VideoTPO为评估和推进视频生成模型的推理能力奠定了基础，为该新兴领域的未来研究设定了方向。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of video generative models has shifted their focus from producing visually plausible outputs to tackling tasks requiring physical plausibility and logical consistency. However, despite recent breakthroughs such as Veo 3's chain-of-frames reasoning, it remains unclear whether these models can exhibit reasoning capabilities similar to large language models (LLMs). Existing benchmarks predominantly evaluate visual fidelity and temporal coherence, failing to capture higher-order reasoning abilities. To bridge this gap, we propose TiViBench, a hierarchical benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of image-to-video (I2V) generation models. TiViBench systematically assesses reasoning across four dimensions: i) Structural Reasoning & Search, ii) Spatial & Visual Pattern Reasoning, iii) Symbolic & Logical Reasoning, and iv) Action Planning & Task Execution, spanning 24 diverse task scenarios across 3 difficulty levels. Through extensive evaluations, we show that commercial models (e.g., Sora 2, Veo 3.1) demonstrate stronger reasoning potential, while open-source models reveal untapped potential that remains hindered by limited training scale and data diversity. To further unlock this potential, we introduce VideoTPO, a simple yet effective test-time strategy inspired by preference optimization. By performing LLM self-analysis on generated candidates to identify strengths and weaknesses, VideoTPO significantly enhances reasoning performance without requiring additional training, data, or reward models. Together, TiViBench and VideoTPO pave the way for evaluating and advancing reasoning in video generation models, setting a foundation for future research in this emerging field.

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在语义图像编辑方面取得进展，但大多数方法难以实现3D感知的对象操作，要么在图像空间操作，要么需要缓慢且容易出错的3D重建。

Result: 大量实验表明，FFSE在单轮和多轮3D感知编辑场景中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FFSE通过3D感知的自回归框架成功实现了对真实图像的直观、物理一致的对象编辑，在多轮编辑场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have significantly improved semantic image editing, yet most methods fall short in performing 3D-aware object manipulation. In this work, we present FFSE, a 3D-aware autoregressive framework designed to enable intuitive, physically-consistent object editing directly on real-world images. Unlike previous approaches that either operate in image space or require slow and error-prone 3D reconstruction, FFSE models editing as a sequence of learned 3D transformations, allowing users to perform arbitrary manipulations, such as translation, scaling, and rotation, while preserving realistic background effects (e.g., shadows, reflections) and maintaining global scene consistency across multiple editing rounds. To support learning of multi-round 3D-aware object manipulation, we introduce 3DObjectEditor, a hybrid dataset constructed from simulated editing sequences across diverse objects and scenes, enabling effective training under multi-round and dynamic conditions. Extensive experiments show that the proposed FFSE significantly outperforms existing methods in both single-round and multi-round 3D-aware editing scenarios.

Motivation: 现有VOS方法主要针对单镜头视频，难以处理镜头间的不连续性，限制了实际应用。需要解决多镜头视频对象分割问题。

Method: 提出过渡模拟数据增强策略(TMA)和SAAS模型，能够检测和理解镜头转换，使用单镜头数据实现跨镜头泛化。

Result: 在YouMVOS和Cut-VOS基准测试中，SAAS模型实现了最先进的性能，有效处理复杂过渡场景。

Conclusion: SAAS模型通过模拟、理解和跨镜头分割，成功解决了多镜头视频对象分割问题，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This work focuses on multi-shot semi-supervised video object segmentation (MVOS), which aims at segmenting the target object indicated by an initial mask throughout a video with multiple shots. The existing VOS methods mainly focus on single-shot videos and struggle with shot discontinuities, thereby limiting their real-world applicability. We propose a transition mimicking data augmentation strategy (TMA) which enables cross-shot generalization with single-shot data to alleviate the severe annotated multi-shot data sparsity, and the Segment Anything Across Shots (SAAS) model, which can detect and comprehend shot transitions effectively. To support evaluation and future study in MVOS, we introduce Cut-VOS, a new MVOS benchmark with dense mask annotations, diverse object categories, and high-frequency transitions. Extensive experiments on YouMVOS and Cut-VOS demonstrate that the proposed SAAS achieves state-of-the-art performance by effectively mimicking, understanding, and segmenting across complex transitions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前去噪扩散模型不直接预测干净图像，而是预测噪声或含噪量。根据流形假设，自然数据位于低维流形上，而含噪量则不在。因此需要直接预测干净数据的模型。

Method: 使用简单的大块Transformer直接在像素级别操作，无需分词器、预训练或额外损失。方法称为"JiT"，使用16和32的大块尺寸在ImageNet上进行实验。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256和512×512分辨率上取得了有竞争力的结果，而预测高维含噪量的方法会灾难性地失败。

Conclusion: 通过将网络映射回流形基础，本研究回归基础，追求基于Transformer的原始自然数据扩散的自包含范式。

Abstract: Today's denoising diffusion models do not "denoise" in the classical sense, i.e., they do not directly predict clean images. Rather, the neural networks predict noise or a noised quantity. In this paper, we suggest that predicting clean data and predicting noised quantities are fundamentally different. According to the manifold assumption, natural data should lie on a low-dimensional manifold, whereas noised quantities do not. With this assumption, we advocate for models that directly predict clean data, which allows apparently under-capacity networks to operate effectively in very high-dimensional spaces. We show that simple, large-patch Transformers on pixels can be strong generative models: using no tokenizer, no pre-training, and no extra loss. Our approach is conceptually nothing more than "$\textbf{Just image Transformers}$", or $\textbf{JiT}$, as we call it. We report competitive results using JiT with large patch sizes of 16 and 32 on ImageNet at resolutions of 256 and 512, where predicting high-dimensional noised quantities can fail catastrophically. With our networks mapping back to the basics of the manifold, our research goes back to basics and pursues a self-contained paradigm for Transformer-based diffusion on raw natural data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统模糊匹配在语义相同但语法不同的引用检索中的失败问题，特别是在对齐官方书面记录和语音转文本转录时。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先使用RapidFuzz进行预过滤，然后使用LLM在短片段上进行验证。

Result: 该方法将模糊匹配准确率提高了最多50个百分点，同时将延迟减半，并将每个正确结果的成本降低了最多96%。

Conclusion: 该方法在不同长度、词汇漂移和领域变化的转录中保持稳健，对不存在目标的拒绝准确率维持在95-100%。

Abstract: Traditional fuzzy matching often fails when searching for quotes that are semantically identical but syntactically different across documents-a common issue when aligning official written records with speech-to-text transcripts. We introduce TimeStampEval, a benchmark for retrieving precise millisecond timestamps from long transcripts given non-verbatim quotes. Our simple two-stage method dramatically improves retrieval accuracy while cutting inference costs by over 90%. The motivating use case is an automated long-form podcast that assembles Congressional Record clips into AI-hosted narration. The technical challenge: given a sentence-timestamped transcript and a target quote that may differ due to transcription or editorial drift, return exact start and end boundaries. Standard algorithms handle verbatim text but break under fuzzier variants. Evaluating six modern LLMs on a 2,800-sentence (120k-token) transcript revealed four key findings. (1) Prompt design matters more than model choice: placing the query before the transcript and using compact formatting improved accuracy by 3-20 points while reducing token count by 30-40%. (2) Off-by-one errors form a distinct category, showing models understand the task but misplace boundaries. (3) A modest reasoning budget (600-850 tokens) raises accuracy from 37% to 77% for weak setups and to above 90% for strong ones. (4) Our "Assisted Fuzzy" approach-RapidFuzz pre-filtering followed by LLM verification on short snippets-improves fuzzy match accuracy by up to 50 points while halving latency and reducing cost per correct result by up to 96%. Extended tests on ten transcripts (50k-900k tokens, 1989-2025) confirm robustness to transcript length, vocabulary drift, and domain change, maintaining 95-100% rejection accuracy for absent targets.

TL;DR: MiroThinker v1.0是一个开源研究代理，通过交互扩展作为模型规模和上下文长度之外的第三个性能提升维度，实现了高效的工具增强推理和信息检索能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅通过扩大模型规模或上下文长度来提升性能，但存在推理链过长时性能下降的问题。本研究探索在模型层面进行交互扩展，利用环境反馈和外部信息获取来纠正错误和优化推理轨迹。

Method: 通过强化学习训练模型实现交互扩展，在256K上下文窗口下每个任务可执行多达600次工具调用，支持持续多轮推理和复杂研究工作流。

Result: 在GAIA、HLE、BrowseComp和BrowseComp-ZH四个基准测试中，72B变体分别达到81.9%、37.7%、47.1%和55.6%的准确率，超越先前开源代理并接近GPT-5-high等商业模型。

Conclusion: 交互扩展展现出与模型规模和上下文长度类似的扩展行为，被确立为构建下一代开源研究代理的第三个关键维度。

Abstract: We present MiroThinker v1.0, an open-source research agent designed to advance tool-augmented reasoning and information-seeking capabilities. Unlike previous agents that only scale up model size or context length, MiroThinker explores interaction scaling at the model level, systematically training the model to handle deeper and more frequent agent-environment interactions as a third dimension of performance improvement. Unlike LLM test-time scaling, which operates in isolation and risks degradation with longer reasoning chains, interactive scaling leverages environment feedback and external information acquisition to correct errors and refine trajectories. Through reinforcement learning, the model achieves efficient interaction scaling: with a 256K context window, it can perform up to 600 tool calls per task, enabling sustained multi-turn reasoning and complex real-world research workflows. Across four representative benchmarks-GAIA, HLE, BrowseComp, and BrowseComp-ZH-the 72B variant achieves up to 81.9%, 37.7%, 47.1%, and 55.6% accuracy respectively, surpassing previous open-source agents and approaching commercial counterparts such as GPT-5-high. Our analysis reveals that MiroThinker benefits from interactive scaling consistently: research performance improves predictably as the model engages in deeper and more frequent agent-environment interactions, demonstrating that interaction depth exhibits scaling behaviors analogous to model size and context length. These findings establish interaction scaling as a third critical dimension for building next-generation open research agents, complementing model capacity and context windows.

### [299] [On the Notion that Language Models Reason](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11810)
*Bertram Højer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文质疑语言模型是否真正具备推理能力，认为LM只是实现隐式有限阶马尔可夫核，其推理式输出对应统计规律而非显式逻辑机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估语言模型推理能力的定义，指出当前NLP领域对推理概念的使用与LM训练、信息处理和生成方式不一致。

Method: 假设基于Transformer的LM实现隐式有限阶马尔可夫核，将上下文映射到条件标记分布，分析推理式输出如何对应统计规律和近似统计不变性。

Result: 论证LM是"统计模式匹配器"而非真正推理者，解释了为何LM会产生推理式输出但无法保证逻辑一致性。

Conclusion: 这种区分对于评估LM中的认知不确定性至关重要，呼吁讨论NLP研究中系统计算过程描述的重要性。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are said to be exhibiting reasoning, but what does this entail? We assess definitions of reasoning and how key papers in the field of natural language processing (NLP) use the notion and argue that the definitions provided are not consistent with how LMs are trained, process information, and generate new tokens. To illustrate this incommensurability we assume the view that transformer-based LMs implement an \textit{implicit} finite-order Markov kernel mapping contexts to conditional token distributions. In this view, reasoning-like outputs correspond to statistical regularities and approximate statistical invariances in the learned kernel rather than the implementation of explicit logical mechanisms. This view is illustrative of the claim that LMs are "statistical pattern matchers"" and not genuine reasoners and provides a perspective that clarifies why reasoning-like outputs arise in LMs without any guarantees of logical consistency. This distinction is fundamental to how epistemic uncertainty is evaluated in LMs. We invite a discussion on the importance of how the computational processes of the systems we build and analyze in NLP research are described.

*Hong-Jun Yoon,Faisal Ashraf,Thomas A. Ruggles,Debjani Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估7个开源大语言模型(0.6B-70B参数)在水电许可文档信息提取中的性能-资源权衡，发现14B参数是性能转折点，为监管文档信息提取提供首个全面的资源-性能映射指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监管文档信息提取需要在性能和计算资源之间做出关键权衡，需要为实际部署提供实证指导。

Method: 在水电许可文档上评估7个不同参数规模(0.6B-70B)的开源模型，分析验证方法的有效性。

Result: 发现14B参数阈值：低于此阈值时验证方法无效(F1<0.15)，高于此阈值时验证方法可行(F1=0.64)。消费级模型通过适当验证可达64% F1，小型模型停滞在51%，大型模型接近77%但需企业基础设施。

Conclusion: 建立了监管背景下开源信息提取的首个全面资源-性能映射，为基于证据的模型选择提供指导，这些发现对水电合规具有直接价值，且参数缩放效应的见解可推广到其他信息提取任务。

Abstract: Information extraction from regulatory documents using large language models presents critical trade-offs between performance and computational resources. We evaluated seven open-weight models (0.6B-70B parameters) on hydropower licensing documentation to provide empirical deployment guidance.
  Our analysis identified a pronounced 14B parameter threshold where validation methods transition from ineffective (F1 $<$ 0.15) to viable (F1 = 0.64). Consumer-deployable models achieve 64\% F1 through appropriate validation, while smaller models plateau at 51\%. Large-scale models approach 77\% F1 but require enterprise infrastructure.
  We identified systematic hallucination patterns where perfect recall indicates extraction failure rather than success in smaller models. Our findings establish the first comprehensive resource-performance mapping for open-weight information extraction in regulatory contexts, enabling evidence-based model selection.
  These results provide immediate value for hydropower compliance while contributing insights into parameter scaling effects that generalize across information extraction tasks.

*Mihir Gupte,Ramesh S*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 探索使用基于LLM的自动形式化方法来验证LLM生成的输出与自然语言需求的一致性，通过两个实验展示了该方法在一致性检查和形式验证方面的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM能够从自然语言生成结构化输出，但缺乏正式方法来验证这些输出的准确性，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 使用简单的基于LLM的自动形式化器，将非正式语句转换为形式逻辑，然后验证LLM生成的输出与自然语言需求的一致性。

Result: 在第一个实验中成功识别了两个不同表述的自然语言需求在逻辑上等价；在第二个实验中识别了给定自然语言需求与LLM生成输出之间的逻辑不一致性。

Conclusion: 自动形式化在确保LLM生成输出的保真度和逻辑一致性方面具有显著潜力，为未来更广泛的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Autoformalization, the process of translating informal statements into formal logic, has gained renewed interest with the emergence of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs show promise in generating structured outputs from natural language (NL), such as Gherkin Scenarios from NL feature requirements, there's currently no formal method to verify if these outputs are accurate. This paper takes a preliminary step toward addressing this gap by exploring the use of a simple LLM-based autoformalizer to verify LLM-generated outputs against a small set of natural language requirements. We conducted two distinct experiments. In the first one, the autoformalizer successfully identified that two differently-worded NL requirements were logically equivalent, demonstrating the pipeline's potential for consistency checks. In the second, the autoformalizer was used to identify a logical inconsistency between a given NL requirement and an LLM-generated output, highlighting its utility as a formal verification tool. Our findings, while limited, suggest that autoformalization holds significant potential for ensuring the fidelity and logical consistency of LLM-generated outputs, laying a crucial foundation for future, more extensive studies into this novel application.

TL;DR: 提出一个分析电影剧本情感弧线的框架，通过自定义词典进行情感分析，并使用聚类方法对相似情感模式进行分组，帮助用户选择故事。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 故事理解和分析是自然语言理解中的挑战领域，需要深度计算语义表示和句法处理。大量叙事数据需要自动化语义分析而非手动方法。

Method: 使用基于NRC-VAD数据集的Valence、Arousal和Dominance分数构建自定义词典，通过LabMTsimple storylab模块进行词典式情感分析，并采用Wards层次聚类技术对相似情感图进行聚类。

Result: 在电影数据集上的实验评估表明，该分析结果对消费者和读者在选择叙事或故事时很有帮助。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效分析电影剧本的情感弧线，提取叙事中传达的高层次和低层次概念，并通过聚类方法识别相似的情感模式，为故事选择提供有价值的参考。

Abstract: Story understanding and analysis have long been challenging areas within Natural Language Understanding. Automated narrative analysis requires deep computational semantic representations along with syntactic processing. Moreover, the large volume of narrative data demands automated semantic analysis and computational learning rather than manual analytical approaches. In this paper, we propose a framework that analyzes the sentiment arcs of movie scripts and performs extended analysis related to the context of the characters involved. The framework enables the extraction of high-level and low-level concepts conveyed through the narrative. Using dictionary-based sentiment analysis, our approach applies a custom lexicon built with the LabMTsimple storylab module. The custom lexicon is based on the Valence, Arousal, and Dominance scores from the NRC-VAD dataset. Furthermore, the framework advances the analysis by clustering similar sentiment plots using Wards hierarchical clustering technique. Experimental evaluation on a movie dataset shows that the resulting analysis is helpful to consumers and readers when selecting a narrative or story.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了包含6,393份放射学报告的标注语料库，用于评估大语言模型在放射学随访依从性检测任务中的性能。通过系统比较传统机器学习方法和生成式LLMs，发现GPT-4o在优化提示下表现最佳，接近人类标注者水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏针对放射学任务的领域特定数据集来严格评估大语言模型的性能，需要开发专门的数据集来支持随访依从性检测系统的开发和基准测试。

Method: 构建了包含6,393份放射学报告的标注语料库，系统比较了传统机器学习分类器（逻辑回归、支持向量机、Longformer）和生成式LLMs（GPT-4o、GPT-OSS-20B）。LLMs在基础设置和优化设置下进行测试，优化设置专注于元数据、推荐句子及其上下文。

Result: GPT-4o（优化设置）表现最佳（F1=0.832），GPT-OSS-20B（优化设置）紧随其后（F1=0.828）。逻辑回归和支持向量机也表现良好（F1=0.776和0.775）。人类标注者间一致性很高（F1=0.846）。

Conclusion: 虽然通过提示优化，大语言模型能够接近人类水平的标注一致性，但可解释性强且资源效率高的传统模型仍然是重要的基准方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown considerable promise in clinical natural language processing, yet few domain-specific datasets exist to rigorously evaluate their performance on radiology tasks. In this work, we introduce an annotated corpus of 6,393 radiology reports from 586 patients, each labeled for follow-up imaging status, to support the development and benchmarking of follow-up adherence detection systems. Using this corpus, we systematically compared traditional machine-learning classifiers, including logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM), Longformer, and a fully fine-tuned Llama3-8B-Instruct, with recent generative LLMs. To evaluate generative LLMs, we tested GPT-4o and the open-source GPT-OSS-20B under two configurations: a baseline (Base) and a task-optimized (Advanced) setting that focused inputs on metadata, recommendation sentences, and their surrounding context. A refined prompt for GPT-OSS-20B further improved reasoning accuracy. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, and F1 scores with 95% confidence intervals estimated via non-parametric bootstrapping. Inter-annotator agreement was high (F1 = 0.846). GPT-4o (Advanced) achieved the best performance (F1 = 0.832), followed closely by GPT-OSS-20B (Advanced; F1 = 0.828). LR and SVM also performed strongly (F1 = 0.776 and 0.775), underscoring that while LLMs approach human-level agreement through prompt optimization, interpretable and resource-efficient models remain valuable baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedPT是首个针对巴西葡萄牙语的大规模真实医疗问答数据集，包含384,095个医患互动问答对，通过多阶段筛选和LLM标注增强，支持医疗专业路由等任务，旨在解决低资源语言医疗AI的公平性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在医疗领域主要关注高资源语言的问题，因为简单翻译无法捕捉特定临床和文化细微差别（如地方性疾病），需要为葡萄牙语等低资源语言开发专门的医疗数据集。

Method: 构建包含384,095个真实医患问答对的巴西葡萄牙语语料库，采用混合定量-定性分析的多阶段筛选协议过滤噪声，使用LLM驱动标注将问题分类为7种语义类型，并分析其主题广度和语言特性。

Result: 数据集涵盖3,200个主题，展示了医患沟通的自然不对称性。在医疗专业路由任务中，微调1.7B参数模型在20类设置下达到94%的F1分数，错误分类反映了真实的临床模糊性而非随机错误。

Conclusion: MedPT数据集具有深度语义丰富性，能够促进为葡萄牙语世界开发更公平、准确和文化敏感的医疗技术，该数据集已公开发布。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) show transformative potential in healthcare, their development remains focused on high-resource languages, creating a critical barrier for others as simple translation fails to capture unique clinical and cultural nuances, such as endemic diseases. To address this, we introduce MedPT, the first large-scale, real-world corpus for Brazilian Portuguese, comprising 384,095 authentic question-answer pairs from patient-doctor interactions. The dataset underwent a meticulous multi-stage curation protocol, using a hybrid quantitative-qualitative analysis to filter noise and contextually enrich thousands of ambiguous queries. We further augmented the corpus via LLM-driven annotation, classifying questions into seven semantic types to capture user intent. Our analysis reveals its thematic breadth (3,200 topics) and unique linguistic properties, like the natural asymmetry in patient-doctor communication. To validate its utility, we benchmark a medical specialty routing task: fine-tuning a 1.7B parameter model achieves an outstanding 94\% F1-score on a 20-class setup. Furthermore, our qualitative error analysis shows misclassifications are not random but reflect genuine clinical ambiguities (e.g., between comorbid conditions), proving the dataset's deep semantic richness. We publicly release MedPT to foster the development of more equitable, accurate, and culturally-aware medical technologies for the Portuguese-speaking world.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ClinStructor使用大语言模型将临床自由文本转换为结构化问答对，以解决临床笔记中的偏见、泛化性和可解释性问题，在ICU死亡率预测任务中性能仅轻微下降2-3%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床笔记包含丰富信息但格式非结构化，存在无意偏见（如性别或种族偏见）、跨临床环境泛化性差（不同EHR系统格式差异导致模型性能下降）以及可解释性差的问题。

Method: 提出ClinStructor管道，利用大语言模型将临床自由文本转换为结构化的、任务特定的问答对，然后进行预测建模。

Result: 该方法显著提高了透明度和可控性，在ICU死亡率预测任务中，与直接微调相比，预测性能仅轻微下降（AUC下降2-3%）。

Conclusion: ClinStructor为在临床环境中构建可靠、可解释和可泛化的机器学习模型奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Clinical notes contain valuable, context-rich information, but their unstructured format introduces several challenges, including unintended biases (e.g., gender or racial bias), and poor generalization across clinical settings (e.g., models trained on one EHR system may perform poorly on another due to format differences) and poor interpretability. To address these issues, we present ClinStructor, a pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to convert clinical free-text into structured, task-specific question-answer pairs prior to predictive modeling. Our method substantially enhances transparency and controllability and only leads to a modest reduction in predictive performance (a 2-3% drop in AUC), compared to direct fine-tuning, on the ICU mortality prediction task. ClinStructor lays a strong foundation for building reliable, interpretable, and generalizable machine learning models in clinical environments.

Motivation: COVID-19加剧了心理健康服务的可及性挑战，需要远程心理健康支持。现有大语言模型缺乏情境和情感意识，无法提供合适的治疗响应。

Method: 重构输入格式以同时处理情境信息和情绪状态，采用多组件奖励函数，结合监督微调和强化学习技术。

Result: 强化学习在多个评估指标上优于基线GPT-2：BLEU(0.0111)、ROUGE-1(0.1397)、ROUGE-2(0.0213)、ROUGE-L(0.1317)、METEOR(0.0581)，情绪识别准确率达99.34%（基线为66.96%）。

Conclusion: 强化学习能有效开发治疗对话系统，作为治疗师的有价值辅助工具，同时保持必要的人类临床监督。

Abstract: Mental health illness represents a substantial global socioeconomic burden, with COVID-19 further exacerbating accessibility challenges and driving increased demand for telehealth mental health support. While large language models (LLMs) offer promising solutions through 24/7 availability and non-judgmental interactions, pre-trained models often lack the contextual and emotional awareness necessary for appropriate therapeutic responses. This paper investigated the application of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to enhance GPT-2's capacity for therapeutic dialogue generation. The methodology restructured input formats to enable simultaneous processing of contextual information and emotional states alongside user input, employing a multi-component reward function that aligned model outputs with professional therapist responses and annotated emotions. Results demonstrated improvements through reinforcement learning over baseline GPT-2 across multiple evaluation metrics: BLEU (0.0111), ROUGE-1 (0.1397), ROUGE-2 (0.0213), ROUGE-L (0.1317), and METEOR (0.0581). LLM evaluation confirmed high contextual relevance and professionalism, while reinforcement learning achieved 99.34% emotion accuracy compared to 66.96% for baseline GPT-2. These findings demonstrate reinforcement learning's effectiveness in developing therapeutic dialogue systems that can serve as valuable assistive tools for therapists while maintaining essential human clinical oversight.

Motivation: 解决LLM在临床文本分类中预测不透明的问题，让研究人员和医生能够理解患者记录中哪些部分驱动风险信号。

Method: 使用加性大语言模型框架，将半结构化文本输入分解为语义组件，预测结果作为各组件贡献的加性总和。

Result: CALM在保持与传统LLM分类器相当性能的同时，提高了可信度，支持质量保证检查，并在模型开发和审计中揭示临床有意义的模式。

Conclusion: CALM为临床文本分类提供了一个性能良好且高度可解释的解决方案，有助于推动LLM在临床实践中的实际应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models have advanced clinical text classification, but their opaque predictions remain a critical barrier to practical adoption in research and clinical settings where investigators and physicians need to understand which parts of a patient's record drive risk signals. To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{CALM}, short for \textbf{Classification with Additive Large Language Models}, an interpretable framework for semi-structured text where inputs are composed of semantically meaningful components, such as sections of an admission note or question-answer fields from an intake form. CALM predicts outcomes as the additive sum of each component's contribution, making these contributions part of the forward computation itself and enabling faithful explanations at both the patient and population level. The additive structure also enables clear visualizations, such as component-level risk curves similar to those used in generalized additive models, making the learned relationships easier to inspect and communicate. Although CALM expects semi-structured inputs, many clinical documents already have this form, and similar structure can often be automatically extracted from free-text notes. CALM achieves performance comparable to conventional LLM classifiers while improving trust, supporting quality-assurance checks, and revealing clinically meaningful patterns during model development and auditing.

Motivation: 解决LLM代理直接生成和执行代码访问敏感数据带来的安全风险，通过预定义安全工具来限制LLM的数据访问权限。

Method: 引入InData数据集，包含三个难度级别的数据分析问题，评估15个开源LLM在多步骤工具推理方面的能力。

Result: 大型模型在简单任务上表现良好（97.3%准确率），但在困难任务上性能显著下降（69.6%），显示当前LLMs缺乏稳健的多步骤工具推理能力。

Conclusion: InData数据集为开发和评估具有更强多步骤工具使用能力的LLMs迈出了重要一步，将公开发布数据集和代码。

Abstract: Large language model agents for data analysis typically generate and execute code directly on databases. However, when applied to sensitive data, this approach poses significant security risks. To address this issue, we propose a security-motivated alternative: restrict LLMs from direct code generation and data access, and require them to interact with data exclusively through a predefined set of secure, verified tools. Although recent tool-use benchmarks exist, they primarily target tool selection and simple execution rather than the compositional, multi-step reasoning needed for complex data analysis. To reduce this gap, we introduce Indirect Data Engagement (InData), a dataset designed to assess LLMs' multi-step tool-based reasoning ability. InData includes data analysis questions at three difficulty levels--Easy, Medium, and Hard--capturing increasing reasoning complexity. We benchmark 15 open-source LLMs on InData and find that while large models (e.g., gpt-oss-120b) achieve high accuracy on Easy tasks (97.3%), performance drops sharply on Hard tasks (69.6%). These results show that current LLMs still lack robust multi-step tool-based reasoning ability. With InData, we take a step toward enabling the development and evaluation of LLMs with stronger multi-step tool-use capabilities. We will publicly release the dataset and code.

Motivation: 大语言模型在知识图谱对话生成任务中往往过度依赖内部知识，而忽视提供的外部知识图谱，导致生成内容与知识图谱脱节。

Method: 1. 引入LLM-KAT评估程序来衡量生成响应中的知识附着程度；2. 提出简单有效的实体匿名化技术，鼓励LLMs更好地利用外部知识。

Result: 在OpenDialKG数据集上的实验表明，该方法有效提高了LLMs对外部知识的附着能力。

Conclusion: 实体匿名化技术是一种简单而有效的方法，能够显著改善大语言模型在知识图谱对话生成中对外部知识的利用效果。

Abstract: Knowledge graph-based dialogue generation (KG-DG) is a challenging task requiring models to effectively incorporate external knowledge into conversational responses. While large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results across various NLP tasks, their ability to utilize external knowledge in KG-DG remains under-explored. We observe that LLMs often rely on internal knowledge, leading to detachment from provided knowledge graphs, even when they are given a flawlessly retrieved knowledge graph. First, we introduce LLM-KAT, an evaluation procedure for measuring knowledge attachment in generated responses. Second, we propose a simple yet effective entity anonymization technique to encourage LLMs to better leverage external knowledge. Experiments on the OpenDialKG dataset demonstrate that our approach improves LLMs' attachment on external knowledge.

*Steven Cao,Gregory Valiant,Percy Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究语言模型的熵校准问题，发现模型存在校准错误，随着生成文本变长，每步熵增加且文本质量下降。理论分析和实验表明，校准错误随模型规模扩展改善缓慢，截断分布只能以牺牲多样性为代价改善质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型熵校准问题，探索模型生成过程中熵积累的根本问题，以及是否可能在不牺牲对数损失的情况下实现校准。

Method: 首先在简化理论设置中分析校准错误随数据集规模的扩展行为，然后实证测量从0.5B到70B参数的语言模型的校准错误。

Result: 发现校准错误的扩展行为与理论预测相似：拟合的扩展指数接近0，意味着更大模型以与小模型相似的速率积累错误。截断分布能改善文本质量但增加对数损失。

Conclusion: 理论上证明，如果假设能够访问可以预测文本未来熵的黑盒模型，那么可以在不牺牲对数损失的情况下减少熵，实现校准。

Abstract: We study the problem of entropy calibration, which asks whether a language model's entropy over generations matches its log loss on human text. Past work found that models are miscalibrated, with entropy per step increasing (and text quality decreasing) as generations grow longer. This error accumulation is a fundamental problem in autoregressive models, and the standard solution is to truncate the distribution, which improves text quality at the cost of diversity. In this paper, we ask: is miscalibration likely to improve with scale, and is it theoretically possible to calibrate without tradeoffs? To build intuition, we first study a simplified theoretical setting to characterize the scaling behavior of miscalibration with respect to dataset size. We find that the scaling behavior depends on the power law exponent of the data distribution -- in particular, for a power law exponent close to 1, the scaling exponent is close to 0, meaning that miscalibration improves very slowly with scale. Next, we measure miscalibration empirically in language models ranging from 0.5B to 70B parameters. We find that the observed scaling behavior is similar to what is predicted by the simplified setting: our fitted scaling exponents for text are close to 0, meaning that larger models accumulate error at a similar rate as smaller ones. This scaling (or, lack thereof) provides one explanation for why we sample from larger models with similar amounts of truncation as smaller models, even though the larger models are of higher quality. However, truncation is not a satisfying solution because it comes at the cost of increased log loss. In theory, is it even possible to reduce entropy while preserving log loss? We prove that it is possible, if we assume access to a black box which can fit models to predict the future entropy of text.

Conclusion: ReasoningNER框架通过显式推理机制显著提升了NER性能，特别是在零样本场景下，为推理导向的信息提取研究提供了重要推进。

Abstract: Generative LLMs typically improve Named Entity Recognition (NER) performance through instruction tuning. They excel at generating entities by semantic pattern matching but lack an explicit, verifiable reasoning mechanism. This "cognitive shortcutting" leads to suboptimal performance and brittle generalization, especially in zero-shot and lowresource scenarios where reasoning from limited contextual cues is crucial. To address this issue, a reasoning framework is proposed for NER, which shifts the extraction paradigm from implicit pattern matching to explicit reasoning. This framework consists of three stages: Chain of Thought (CoT) generation, CoT tuning, and reasoning enhancement. First, a dataset annotated with NER-oriented CoTs is generated, which contain task-relevant reasoning chains. Then, they are used to tune the NER model to generate coherent rationales before deriving the final answer. Finally, a reasoning enhancement stage is implemented to optimize the reasoning process using a comprehensive reward signal. This stage ensures explicit and verifiable extractions. Experiments show that ReasoningNER demonstrates impressive cognitive ability in the NER task, achieving competitive performance. In zero-shot settings, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, outperforming GPT-4 by 12.3 percentage points on the F1 score. Analytical results also demonstrate its great potential to advance research in reasoningoriented information extraction. Our codes are available at https://github.com/HuiResearch/ReasoningIE.

TL;DR: CoT解释在道德场景中具有双重作用：既能提高透明度，也可能因用户只看结果而忽视错误推理，导致确认偏见。研究发现用户信任与结果一致性相关，自信的语气会抑制错误检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究CoT解释在道德场景中的双重作用，探索其如何既增强透明度又可能因用户只看结果而忽视错误推理，导致确认偏见。

Method: 在多模态道德场景中，通过系统性地扰动推理链和操纵表达语气，分析视觉语言模型中的推理错误及其对用户信任和错误检测能力的影响。

Result: 发现两个关键效应：(1)用户将信任等同于结果一致性，即使推理有缺陷仍保持依赖；(2)自信的语气抑制错误检测但维持依赖，表明表达风格可以超越正确性。

Conclusion: CoT解释既能澄清也能误导，强调NLP系统需要提供鼓励审查和批判性思维而非盲目信任的解释。

Abstract: Explanations are often promoted as tools for transparency, but they can also foster confirmation bias; users may assume reasoning is correct whenever outputs appear acceptable. We study this double-edged role of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) explanations in multimodal moral scenarios by systematically perturbing reasoning chains and manipulating delivery tones. Specifically, we analyze reasoning errors in vision language models (VLMs) and how they impact user trust and the ability to detect errors. Our findings reveal two key effects: (1) users often equate trust with outcome agreement, sustaining reliance even when reasoning is flawed, and (2) the confident tone suppresses error detection while maintaining reliance, showing that delivery styles can override correctness. These results highlight how CoT explanations can simultaneously clarify and mislead, underscoring the need for NLP systems to provide explanations that encourage scrutiny and critical thinking rather than blind trust. All code will be released publicly.

*Truong Vo,Sanmi Koyejo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个用于评估大语言模型文化能力的新基准，通过情境化评估方法揭示现有薄评估方法的局限性，并引入多维度的评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型文化能力评估方法主要关注脱离语境的正确性或强制选择判断，忽略了文化理解和推理的需求。模型在多元文化环境中的部署需要更全面的文化能力评估。

Method: 引入基于现实情境的基准测试，要求模型进行文化基础推理。除了标准精确匹配指标外，还提出了四个补充指标：覆盖率、特异性、内涵和连贯性，以捕捉模型响应质量的不同维度。

Result: 实证分析显示，薄评估系统性地高估了文化能力，产生不稳定且方差大的评估结果。相比之下，厚评估能够揭示推理深度的差异，减少方差，并提供更稳定、可解释的文化理解信号。

Conclusion: 情境化的厚评估方法比传统的薄评估方法更能准确反映大语言模型的文化能力，为模型在多元文化环境中的部署提供了更可靠的评估框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in culturally diverse environments, yet existing evaluations of cultural competence remain limited. Existing methods focus on de-contextualized correctness or forced-choice judgments, overlooking the need for cultural understanding and reasoning required for appropriate responses. To address this gap, we introduce a set of benchmarks that, instead of directly probing abstract norms or isolated statements, present models with realistic situational contexts that require culturally grounded reasoning. In addition to the standard Exact Match metric, we introduce four complementary metrics (Coverage, Specificity, Connotation, and Coherence) to capture different dimensions of model's response quality. Empirical analysis across frontier models reveals that thin evaluation systematically overestimates cultural competence and produces unstable assessments with high variance. In contrast, thick evaluation exposes differences in reasoning depth, reduces variance, and provides more stable, interpretable signals of cultural understanding.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在有限训练数据下，如何通过回译和微调的组合策略提升低资源语言对的机器翻译质量

Method: 首先使用回译生成合成数据，然后在真实小规模平行语料上进行微调，最后结合两种方法：先用回译增强数据再进行微调

Result: 回译单独使用从COMET 0.460提升到0.468；微调单独使用提升到0.589；两者结合达到最佳效果0.597

Conclusion: 回译和针对性微调的协同使用能显著提升翻译质量，为低资源语言对提供轻量级但强大的改进策略

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of combining fine-tuning and backtranslation on a small Japanese corpus for neural machine translation. Starting from a baseline English{\textrightarrow}Japanese model (COMET = 0.460), we first apply backtranslation (BT) using synthetic data generated from monolingual Japanese corpora, yielding a modest increase (COMET = 0.468). Next, we fine-tune (FT) the model on a genuine small parallel dataset drawn from diverse Japanese news and literary corpora, achieving a substantial jump to COMET = 0.589 when using Mistral 7B. Finally, we integrate both backtranslation and fine-tuning{ -- }first augmenting the small dataset with BT generated examples, then adapting via FT{ -- }which further boosts performance to COMET = 0.597. These results demonstrate that, even with limited training data, the synergistic use of backtranslation and targeted fine-tuning on Japanese corpora can significantly enhance translation quality, outperforming each technique in isolation. This approach offers a lightweight yet powerful strategy for improving low-resource language pairs.

TL;DR: LLMLagBench是一个用于评估LLM训练数据时间边界的基准测试，通过检测模型对近期事件的了解来识别其知识的新鲜度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在特定时间点前的文本数据上进行预训练，这形成了严格的知识边界。当这个限制未知或被忽视时，模型可能在推理任务中无意间混合过时的时效性信息与通用知识，从而影响回答准确性。

Method: 引入LLMLagBench作为系统性方法，通过评估LLM对近期事件的知识来识别其训练数据的最早可能时间边界。该基准用于评估大量LLM，包括那些明确声明和未声明训练截止时间的模型。

Result: 通过人工验证和与公开发布的LLM预训练信息进行比较，评估了基准的可靠性。

Conclusion: LLMLagBench提供了一种系统性的方法来识别LLM的知识时间边界，有助于理解模型的知识新鲜度和潜在的信息过时问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are pretrained on textual data up to a specific temporal cutoff. This creates a strict knowledge boundary beyond which models cannot provide accurate information without querying external sources. More subtly, when this limitation is unknown or ignored, LLMs may inadvertently blend outdated time-sensitive information with general knowledge during reasoning tasks, potentially compromising response accuracy. We introduce LLMLagBench, an LLM freshness benchmark, as a systematic approach for identifying the earliest probable temporal boundaries of an LLM's training data by evaluating its knowledge of recent events. We then apply this benchmark to evaluate a large set of LLMs, including models with both explicitly declared and undeclared training cutoffs. The reliability of the benchmark is assessed by manual validation and comparison with publicly released information about LLM pretraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究存在伪多模态（源帖子包含视觉而评论仅文本）和用户同质化（忽略个人特质）的局限性，无法反映真实世界的多模态交互。

Method: PRISM模型：1）从历史帖子推导纵向用户角色；2）通过思维链对齐文本和视觉线索；3）使用相互任务强化机制联合优化立场检测和立场感知响应生成。

Result: 在U-MStance数据集上的实验表明，PRISM相比强基线模型取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: 用户中心和上下文基础的多模态推理对于现实立场理解非常有效。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of multimodal social media content has driven research in Multimodal Conversational Stance Detection (MCSD), which aims to interpret users' attitudes toward specific targets within complex discussions. However, existing studies remain limited by: **1) pseudo-multimodality**, where visual cues appear only in source posts while comments are treated as text-only, misaligning with real-world multimodal interactions; and **2) user homogeneity**, where diverse users are treated uniformly, neglecting personal traits that shape stance expression. To address these issues, we introduce **U-MStance**, the first user-centric MCSD dataset, containing over 40k annotated comments across six real-world targets. We further propose **PRISM**, a **P**ersona-**R**easoned mult**I**modal **S**tance **M**odel for MCSD. PRISM first derives longitudinal user personas from historical posts and comments to capture individual traits, then aligns textual and visual cues within conversational context via Chain-of-Thought to bridge semantic and pragmatic gaps across modalities. Finally, a mutual task reinforcement mechanism is employed to jointly optimize stance detection and stance-aware response generation for bidirectional knowledge transfer. Experiments on U-MStance demonstrate that PRISM yields significant gains over strong baselines, underscoring the effectiveness of user-centric and context-grounded multimodal reasoning for realistic stance understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标驱动的说服对话（如电话销售）需要复杂多轮规划和严格事实忠实性，这对现有大语言模型仍是重大挑战。缺乏任务特定数据和直接应用LLM存在策略脆弱性和事实幻觉问题

Method: 构建TeleSalesCorpus数据集，提出AI-Salesman双阶段框架：训练阶段使用贝叶斯监督强化学习从噪声对话中学习鲁棒销售策略；推理阶段引入动态大纲引导代理(DOGA)，利用预构建脚本库提供动态逐轮策略指导

Result: 实验结果表明，AI-Salesman在自动指标和综合人工评估中均显著优于基线模型，在复杂说服场景中展现出有效性

Conclusion: AI-Salesman框架成功解决了目标驱动说服对话中的关键挑战，通过双阶段架构和动态大纲引导实现了鲁棒的销售策略和事实忠实性

Abstract: Goal-driven persuasive dialogue, exemplified by applications like telemarketing, requires sophisticated multi-turn planning and strict factual faithfulness, which remains a significant challenge for even state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs). A lack of task-specific data often limits previous works, and direct LLM application suffers from strategic brittleness and factual hallucination. In this paper, we first construct and release TeleSalesCorpus, the first real-world-grounded dialogue dataset for this domain. We then propose AI-Salesman, a novel framework featuring a dual-stage architecture. For the training stage, we design a Bayesian-supervised reinforcement learning algorithm that learns robust sales strategies from noisy dialogues. For the inference stage, we introduce the Dynamic Outline-Guided Agent (DOGA), which leverages a pre-built script library to provide dynamic, turn-by-turn strategic guidance. Moreover, we design a comprehensive evaluation framework that combines fine-grained metrics for key sales skills with the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed AI-Salesman significantly outperforms baseline models in both automatic metrics and comprehensive human evaluations, showcasing its effectiveness in complex persuasive scenarios.

TL;DR: VBackChecker是一个基于"眼见为实"原则的无参考幻觉检测框架，通过像素级Grounding LLM验证MLLM生成响应与视觉输入的一致性，在R^2-HalBench基准上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型存在严重幻觉问题，需要准确检测以确保实际应用可靠性。

Method: 利用具备推理和参考分割能力的像素级Grounding LLM，设计R-Instruct指令调优数据生成流程，包含丰富上下文描述、定位掩码和困难负样本。

Result: 在R^2-HalBench上超越先前复杂框架，性能媲美GPT-4o，像素级定位任务提升超过10%。

Conclusion: VBackChecker为MLLM幻觉检测提供了有效且可解释的解决方案，在真实世界丰富上下文场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have unlocked powerful cross-modal capabilities, but still significantly suffer from hallucinations. As such, accurate detection of hallucinations in MLLMs is imperative for ensuring their reliability in practical applications. To this end, guided by the principle of "Seeing is Believing", we introduce VBackChecker, a novel reference-free hallucination detection framework that verifies the consistency of MLLMgenerated responses with visual inputs, by leveraging a pixellevel Grounding LLM equipped with reasoning and referring segmentation capabilities. This reference-free framework not only effectively handles rich-context scenarios, but also offers interpretability. To facilitate this, an innovative pipeline is accordingly designed for generating instruction-tuning data (R-Instruct), featuring rich-context descriptions, grounding masks, and hard negative samples. We further establish R^2 -HalBench, a new hallucination benchmark for MLLMs, which, unlike previous benchmarks, encompasses real-world, rich-context descriptions from 18 MLLMs with high-quality annotations, spanning diverse object-, attribute, and relationship-level details. VBackChecker outperforms prior complex frameworks and achieves state-of-the-art performance on R^2 -HalBench, even rivaling GPT-4o's capabilities in hallucination detection. It also surpasses prior methods in the pixel-level grounding task, achieving over a 10% improvement. All codes, data, and models are available at https://github.com/PinxueGuo/VBackChecker.

Motivation: 现有搜索代理管道依赖强化学习优化，但面临稀疏结果奖励问题，导致探索效率低下和训练不稳定。

Method: 使用冻结的非对称批评LLM，基于完整轨迹和黄金答案的优先信息回顾性评估每个回合，将这些评估转化为稳定的密集奖励来指导策略改进。

Result: 在多样化多跳推理基准测试中，CriticSearch始终优于现有基线方法，实现了更快的收敛速度、更好的训练稳定性和更高的性能。

Conclusion: CriticSearch通过密集的回合级反馈机制有效提升了搜索代理在复杂问答任务中的训练效率和性能表现。

Abstract: Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) with search engines enables large language models to iteratively retrieve up-to-date external knowledge, enhancing adaptability and generalization in complex question-answering tasks. However, existing search agent pipelines typically depend on reinforcement learning based optimization, which often suffers from sparse outcome rewards, leading to inefficient exploration and unstable training. We introduce CriticSearch, a fine-grained credit-assignment framework that supplies dense, turn-level feedback via a retrospective critic mechanism. During training, a frozen, asymmetric critique LLM retrospectively evaluates each turn using privileged information from the full trajectory and gold answers, converting these assessments into stable, dense rewards that guide policy improvement. Experimental results across diverse multi-hop reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that CriticSearch consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving faster convergence, improved training stability, and higher performance.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型在面向任务的对话中，在领域适应和检索可控性方面仍面临挑战，特别是在细粒度实体识别任务上。

Method: 使用轻量级管理器进行类型级判断，专业专家进行跨度级提取，每个专家配备KeyInfo检索器，在推理时注入语义对齐的少样本示例，无需额外训练即可实现精确且领域自适应的提取。

Result: 在CrossNER、MIT-Movie、MIT-Restaurant和新构建的多领域客服数据集上的实验表明，MME-RAG在大多数领域表现优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 层次分解和KeyInfo引导的检索是鲁棒性和跨领域泛化的关键驱动因素，MME-RAG成为自适应对话理解的可扩展和可解释解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-grained entity recognition is crucial for reasoning and decision-making in task-oriented dialogues, yet current large language models (LLMs) continue to face challenges in domain adaptation and retrieval controllability. We introduce MME-RAG, a Multi-Manager-Expert Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework that decomposes entity recognition into two coordinated stages: type-level judgment by lightweight managers and span-level extraction by specialized experts. Each expert is supported by a KeyInfo retriever that injects semantically aligned, few-shot exemplars during inference, enabling precise and domain-adaptive extraction without additional training. Experiments on CrossNER, MIT-Movie, MIT-Restaurant, and our newly constructed multi-domain customer-service dataset demonstrate that MME-RAG performs better than recent baselines in most domains. Ablation studies further show that both the hierarchical decomposition and KeyInfo-guided retrieval are key drivers of robustness and cross-domain generalization, establishing MME-RAG as a scalable and interpretable solution for adaptive dialogue understanding.

Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生事实错误的幻觉文本，在医疗、金融等领域存在严重风险。现有方法在模型访问受限时需要多次API调用，增加了延迟和成本。

Method: 基于事实探针响应一致性的直觉：同一LLM内部和不同LLM之间对生成文本中事实探针的响应应该一致。无需外部知识库，资源消耗少。

Conclusion: CONFACTCHECK提供了一种资源高效的幻觉检测解决方案，特别适用于模型访问受限的场景，无需外部知识库即可有效识别事实错误。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their remarkable text generation capabilities, often hallucinate and generate text that is factually incorrect and not grounded in real-world knowledge. This poses serious risks in domains like healthcare, finance, and customer support. A typical way to use LLMs is via the APIs provided by LLM vendors where there is no access to model weights or options to fine-tune the model. Existing methods to detect hallucinations in such settings where the model access is restricted or constrained by resources typically require making multiple LLM API calls, increasing latency and API cost. We introduce CONFACTCHECK, an efficient hallucination detection approach that does not leverage any external knowledge base and works on the simple intuition that responses to factual probes within the generated text should be consistent within a single LLM and across different LLMs. Rigorous empirical evaluation on multiple datasets that cover both the generation of factual texts and the open generation shows that CONFACTCHECK can detect hallucinated facts efficiently using fewer resources and achieves higher accuracy scores compared to existing baselines that operate under similar conditions.

Abstract: Recent advances in contextualized word embeddings have greatly improved semantic tasks such as Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and contextual similarity, but most progress has been limited to high-resource languages like English. Vietnamese, in contrast, still lacks robust models and evaluation resources for fine-grained semantic understanding. In this paper, we present ViConBERT, a novel framework for learning Vietnamese contextualized embeddings that integrates contrastive learning (SimCLR) and gloss-based distillation to better capture word meaning. We also introduce ViConWSD, the first large-scale synthetic dataset for evaluating semantic understanding in Vietnamese, covering both WSD and contextual similarity. Experimental results show that ViConBERT outperforms strong baselines on WSD (F1 = 0.87) and achieves competitive performance on ViCon (AP = 0.88) and ViSim-400 (Spearman's rho = 0.60), demonstrating its effectiveness in modeling both discrete senses and graded semantic relations.

Conclusion: Cmprsr模型在成本-质量权衡方面提供了精细控制，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Motivated by the high costs of using black-box Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce a novel prompt compression paradigm, under which we use smaller LLMs to compress inputs for the larger ones. We present the first comprehensive LLM-as-a-compressor benchmark spanning 25 open- and closed-source models, which reveals significant disparity in models' compression ability in terms of (i) preserving semantically important information (ii) following the user-provided compression rate (CR). We further improve the performance of gpt-4.1-mini, the best overall vanilla compressor, with Textgrad-based compression meta-prompt optimization. We also identify the most promising open-source vanilla LLM - Qwen3-4B - and post-train it with a combination of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), pursuing the dual objective of CR adherence and maximizing the downstream task performance. We call the resulting model Cmprsr and demonstrate its superiority over both extractive and vanilla abstractive compression across the entire range of compression rates on lengthy inputs from MeetingBank and LongBench as well as short prompts from GSM8k. The latter highlights Cmprsr's generalizability across varying input lengths and domains. Moreover, Cmprsr closely follows the requested compression rate, offering fine control over the cost-quality trade-off.

Motivation: 法律判决摘要对法律从业者认知负担重，自动摘要技术受关注。但深度学习方法生成的抽象摘要容易误判法律术语或忽略关键细节，因此抽取式摘要器使用趋势上升。

Method: 设计轻量透明流程，利用现有抽象摘要生成对应的抽取式摘要，确保专家意见从原始抽象摘要传递到转换后的抽取式摘要中。

Result: 增强了七个现有案例摘要数据集，添加了对应的抽取式摘要，并通过结构、词汇和语义维度的广泛比较评估确保质量。

Conclusion: 承诺公开发布增强的数据集，相信该资源将推动法律文档自动摘要领域的发展。

Abstract: Summarization of legal judgments poses a heavy cognitive burden on law practitioners due to the complexity of the language, context-sensitive legal jargon, and the length of the document. Therefore, the automatic summarization of legal documents has attracted serious attention from natural language processing researchers. Since the abstractive summaries of legal documents generated by deep neural methods remain prone to the risk of misrepresenting nuanced legal jargon or overlooking key contextual details, we envisage a rising trend toward the use of extractive case summarizers.
  Given the high cost of human annotation for gold standard extractive summaries, we engineer a light and transparent pipeline that leverages existing abstractive gold standard summaries to create the corresponding extractive gold standard versions. The approach ensures that the experts` opinions ensconced in the original gold standard abstractive summaries are carried over to the transformed extractive summaries. We aim to augment seven existing case summarization datasets, which include abstractive summaries, by incorporating corresponding extractive summaries and create an enriched data resource for case summarization research community. To ensure the quality of the augmented extractive summaries, we perform an extensive comparative evaluation with the original abstractive gold standard summaries covering structural, lexical, and semantic dimensions. We also compare the domain-level information of the two summaries. We commit to release the augmented datasets in the public domain for use by the research community and believe that the resource will offer opportunities to advance the field of automatic summarization of legal documents.

Abstract: LLMs have achieved performance that surpasses humans in many NLP tasks. However, it remains unclear whether problems that are difficult for humans are also difficult for LLMs. This study investigates how the difficulty of quizzes in a buzzer setting differs between LLMs and humans. Specifically, we first collect Japanese quiz data including questions, answers, and correct response rate of humans, then prompted LLMs to answer the quizzes under several settings, and compare their correct answer rate to that of humans from two analytical perspectives. The experimental results showed that, compared to humans, LLMs struggle more with quizzes whose correct answers are not covered by Wikipedia entries, and also have difficulty with questions that require numerical answers.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型中的讽刺反弹现象——否定指令反而会增加被禁止概念的可及性。通过两个实验发现，反弹在否定后立即出现，并随着干扰文本的增长或语义相关性而增强，而重复则有助于抑制。极性分离程度与反弹持续性相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究否定指令在大型语言模型中引发的讽刺反弹现象，即试图抑制某个概念反而会使其更容易被激活，这与人类认知中的类似现象相呼应。

Method: 采用两个实验：(1) 负载与内容实验：在否定指令后引入不同类型的干扰文本（语义、句法、重复），测量反弹强度；(2) 极性分离实验：测试模型是否能区分同一概念的中性和否定框架，以及这种区分是否预测反弹持续性。辅以电路追踪分析识别相关注意力头。

Result: 结果显示否定后立即出现反弹，且随着干扰文本长度增加或语义相关性增强而加剧，而重复有助于抑制。更强的极性分离与更持久的反弹相关。电路分析发现中间层注意力头放大被禁止词元，而早期层进行抑制。

Conclusion: 该研究将认知科学中的讽刺反弹预测与长上下文干扰的机制性理解联系起来，并发布了包含5000个系统变化否定提示的ReboundBench数据集以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Negation instructions such as 'do not mention $X$' can paradoxically increase the accessibility of $X$ in human thought, a phenomenon known as ironic rebound. Large language models (LLMs) face the same challenge: suppressing a concept requires internally activating it, which may prime rebound instead of avoidance. We investigated this tension with two experiments. \textbf{(1) Load \& content}: after a negation instruction, we vary distractor text (semantic, syntactic, repetition) and measure rebound strength. \textbf{(2) Polarity separation}: We test whether models distinguish neutral from negative framings of the same concept and whether this separation predicts rebound persistence. Results show that rebound consistently arises immediately after negation and intensifies with longer or semantic distractors, while repetition supports suppression. Stronger polarity separation correlates with more persistent rebound. Together, these findings, complemented by a circuit tracing analysis that identifies sparse middle-layer attention heads amplifying forbidden tokens while early layers suppress, link cognitive predictions of ironic rebound with mechanistic insights into long-context interference. To support future work, we release ReboundBench, a dataset of $5,000$ systematically varied negation prompts designed to probe rebound in LLMs.

TL;DR: ILAKKANAM是首个泰米尔语语言学评估基准，包含820道来自斯里兰卡学校考试的问题，涵盖5个语言学类别和事实知识类别。评估显示Gemini 2.5表现最佳，开源模型落后，所有模型在低年级问题表现良好但随着语言复杂度增加而下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多语言基准常依赖翻译的英语数据集，无法捕捉泰米尔语等低资源、形态丰富语言的语言和文化细微差别。

Method: 使用820道斯里兰卡学校泰米尔语考试问题构建基准，由训练有素的语言学家在5个语言学类别和事实知识类别下标注，涵盖1-13年级。使用标准化评估框架评估闭源和开源LLM。

Result: Gemini 2.5总体表现最佳，开源模型落后。所有模型在低年级问题表现良好，但随着语言复杂度增加表现明显下降。模型整体表现与识别语言类别能力无强相关性。

Conclusion: LLM在泰米尔语中的表现可能由暴露驱动而非真正理解，需要更多针对低资源语言的语言学基础工作。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong generalization across tasks in high-resource languages; however, their linguistic competence in low-resource and morphologically rich languages such as Tamil remains largely unexplored. Existing multilingual benchmarks often rely on translated English datasets, failing to capture the linguistic and cultural nuances of the target language. To address this gap, we introduce ILAKKANAM, the first Tamil-specific linguistic evaluation benchmark manually curated using 820 questions from Sri Lankan school-level Tamil subject examination papers. Each question is annotated by trained linguists under five linguistic categories and a factual knowledge category, spanning Grades 1--13 to ensure broad linguistic coverage. We evaluate both closed-source and open-source LLMs using a standardized evaluation framework. Our results show that Gemini 2.5 achieves the highest overall performance, while open-source models lag behind, highlighting the gap in linguistic grounding. Category- and grade-wise analyses reveal that all models perform well on lower-grade questions but show a clear decline as linguistic complexity increases. Further, no strong correlation is observed between a model's overall performance and its ability to identify linguistic categories, suggesting that performance may be driven by exposure rather than genuine understanding.

TL;DR: 提出了MRMBench基准和推理时探测方法，用于评估奖励模型在多维偏好上的表现，发现该方法与LLM对齐性能强相关，揭示了奖励模型在多维度偏好捕捉上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型评估方法通常在固定成对排序测试集上进行，但无法提供各偏好维度的性能信息，需要更细粒度的评估方法来分析奖励模型对不同偏好维度的捕捉能力。

Method: 构建了MRMBench基准，包含6个不同偏好维度的探测任务；提出了推理时探测方法，识别奖励预测时使用的维度并增强可解释性；通过大量实验验证方法的有效性。

Result: MRMBench与大型语言模型对齐性能强相关，是开发先进奖励模型的可靠参考；奖励模型在多维度偏好捕捉上表现不佳；推理时探测方法为评估奖励预测置信度提供了可靠指标。

Conclusion: 多维奖励建模具有潜力，推理时探测方法能提升LLM对齐效果，MRMBench为奖励模型开发提供了有效的评估基准。

Abstract: Previous methods evaluate reward models by testing them on a fixed pairwise ranking test set, but they typically do not provide performance information on each preference dimension. In this work, we address the evaluation challenge of reward models by probing preference representations. To confirm the effectiveness of this evaluation method, we construct a Multi-dimensional Reward Model Benchmark (MRMBench), a collection of six probing tasks for different preference dimensions. We design it to favor and encourage reward models that better capture preferences across different dimensions. Furthermore, we introduce an analysis method, inference-time probing, which identifies the dimensions used during the reward prediction and enhances its interpretability. Through extensive experiments, we find that MRMBench strongly correlates with the alignment performance of large language models (LLMs), making it a reliable reference for developing advanced reward models. Our analysis of MRMBench evaluation results reveals that reward models often struggle to capture preferences across multiple dimensions, highlighting the potential of multi-objective optimization in reward modeling. Additionally, our findings show that the proposed inference-time probing method offers a reliable metric for assessing the confidence of reward predictions, which ultimately improves the alignment of LLMs.

Motivation: 现有KGQA系统通常返回高度相关但可预测的答案，缺乏发现惊喜和新颖答案的能力。

Method: 提出基于相关性、新颖性和惊喜度的严谨意外性指标，构建专家标注的临床知识图谱基准，包含知识检索、子图推理和意外性探索三个子任务的结构化评估流程。

Result: 实验表明，最先进的LLMs在检索方面表现良好，但在识别真正令人惊喜和有价值的发现方面仍有困难。

Conclusion: 在发现意外洞察方面仍有显著改进空间，发布了相关资源和扩展版本。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly advanced knowledge graph question answering (KGQA), yet existing systems are typically optimized for returning highly relevant but predictable answers. A missing yet desired capacity is to exploit LLMs to suggest surprise and novel ("serendipitious") answers. In this paper, we formally define the serendipity-aware KGQA task and propose the SerenQA framework to evaluate LLMs' ability to uncover unexpected insights in scientific KGQA tasks. SerenQA includes a rigorous serendipity metric based on relevance, novelty, and surprise, along with an expert-annotated benchmark derived from the Clinical Knowledge Graph, focused on drug repurposing. Additionally, it features a structured evaluation pipeline encompassing three subtasks: knowledge retrieval, subgraph reasoning, and serendipity exploration. Our experiments reveal that while state-of-the-art LLMs perform well on retrieval, they still struggle to identify genuinely surprising and valuable discoveries, underscoring a significant room for future improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决LLM在人类-AI对话场景中的安全风险，包括有害内容生成和对抗性提示攻击，需要开发轻量级且高效的安全防护系统。

Method: 构建两个专门化模型：ContentFilter基于MLCommons危害分类学识别安全风险，JailbreakFilter通过精心设计的课程学习覆盖60种主要攻击类型。使用约140万训练实例对基础模型进行指令调优。

Result: 在公共和专有安全基准测试中达到最先进的安全性能，同时保持轻量级部署，提供多类安全预测和二元置信度分数以提高可解释性。

Conclusion: SGuard-v1作为轻量级安全护栏系统，在减少部署开销的同时实现了优秀的安全性能，并通过Apache-2.0许可证发布以促进进一步研究和实际部署。

Abstract: We present SGuard-v1, a lightweight safety guardrail for Large Language Models (LLMs), which comprises two specialized models to detect harmful content and screen adversarial prompts in human-AI conversational settings. The first component, ContentFilter, is trained to identify safety risks in LLM prompts and responses in accordance with the MLCommons hazard taxonomy, a comprehensive framework for trust and safety assessment of AI. The second component, JailbreakFilter, is trained with a carefully designed curriculum over integrated datasets and findings from prior work on adversarial prompting, covering 60 major attack types while mitigating false-unsafe classification. SGuard-v1 is built on the 2B-parameter Granite-3.3-2B-Instruct model that supports 12 languages. We curate approximately 1.4 million training instances from both collected and synthesized data and perform instruction tuning on the base model, distributing the curated data across the two component according to their designated functions. Through extensive evaluation on public and proprietary safety benchmarks, SGuard-v1 achieves state-of-the-art safety performance while remaining lightweight, thereby reducing deployment overhead. SGuard-v1 also improves interpretability for downstream use by providing multi-class safety predictions and their binary confidence scores. We release the SGuard-v1 under the Apache-2.0 License to enable further research and practical deployment in AI safety.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QA-Noun是一个基于问答的框架，专门用于捕捉名词为中心的语义关系，通过9个问题模板覆盖名词的显式句法和隐式上下文角色，与QA-SRL结合实现句子意义的统一分解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于QA的语义方法主要关注谓词-论元关系，但对名词为中心的语义关系处理不足，需要开发一个框架来补充这一空白。

Method: 定义9个问题模板，覆盖名词的显式和隐式角色；创建包含2000多个标注名词的数据集；训练模型并与QA-SRL集成。

Result: QA-Noun几乎完全覆盖AMR的名词论元，同时发现额外的上下文隐含关系；与QA-SRL结合后比FactScore和DecompScore等方法的粒度高出130%以上。

Conclusion: QA-Noun补充了更广泛的基于QA的语义框架，为跨文本对齐提供了一个全面且可扩展的细粒度语义分解方法。

Abstract: Decomposing sentences into fine-grained meaning units is increasingly used to model semantic alignment. While QA-based semantic approaches have shown effectiveness for representing predicate-argument relations, they have so far left noun-centered semantics largely unaddressed. We introduce QA-Noun, a QA-based framework for capturing noun-centered semantic relations. QA-Noun defines nine question templates that cover both explicit syntactical and implicit contextual roles for nouns, producing interpretable QA pairs that complement verbal QA-SRL. We release detailed guidelines, a dataset of over 2,000 annotated noun mentions, and a trained model integrated with QA-SRL to yield a unified decomposition of sentence meaning into individual, highly fine-grained, facts. Evaluation shows that QA-Noun achieves near-complete coverage of AMR's noun arguments while surfacing additional contextually implied relations, and that combining QA-Noun with QA-SRL yields over 130\% higher granularity than recent fact-based decomposition methods such as FactScore and DecompScore. QA-Noun thus complements the broader QA-based semantic framework, forming a comprehensive and scalable approach to fine-grained semantic decomposition for cross-text alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法将外部知识截断为小块导致信息丢失，引发响应幻觉和推理链断裂，且检索的非结构化知识包含无关细节影响准确推理。

Method: 提出意图驱动路由机制到领域特定提取模板，结合监督微调和基于强化学习的隐式提取机制，确保知识整合的简洁性、连贯性和非冗余性。

Result: 在六个公共基准测试和一个真实业务基准(NowNewsQA)上，使用三种骨干模型评估，TAdaRAG在多个领域和长文本任务中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TAdaRAG展示了强大的泛化能力和实际有效性，为检索增强生成提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves large language models by retrieving external knowledge, often truncated into smaller chunks due to the input context window, which leads to information loss, resulting in response hallucinations and broken reasoning chains. Moreover, traditional RAG retrieves unstructured knowledge, introducing irrelevant details that hinder accurate reasoning. To address these issues, we propose TAdaRAG, a novel RAG framework for on-the-fly task-adaptive knowledge graph construction from external sources. Specifically, we design an intent-driven routing mechanism to a domain-specific extraction template, followed by supervised fine-tuning and a reinforcement learning-based implicit extraction mechanism, ensuring concise, coherent, and non-redundant knowledge integration. Evaluations on six public benchmarks and a real-world business benchmark (NowNewsQA) across three backbone models demonstrate that TAdaRAG outperforms existing methods across diverse domains and long-text tasks, highlighting its strong generalization and practical effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种因果框架和反事实数据增强方法来减轻RLHF奖励模型中的长度偏差问题，通过构造长度不同但内容相似、以及长度相似但内容不同的响应对来训练奖励模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF训练的奖励模型存在长度偏差，倾向于将冗长与质量混淆，偏好更长的响应，这影响了模型评估的准确性。

Method: 使用反事实数据增强方法，构造两种类型的响应对：(1)内容相似但长度不同的长度发散对，(2)长度相似但内容不同的内容发散对，用于训练奖励模型。

Result: 实证评估表明该方法减少了奖励分配中的长度偏差，使策略模型产生更简洁、内容聚焦的输出。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效减轻了长度偏差，提高了RLHF流程中奖励建模的鲁棒性和内容敏感性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is widely used to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, RLHF-trained reward models often exhibit length bias -- a systematic tendency to favor longer responses by conflating verbosity with quality. We propose a causal framework for analyzing and mitigating length bias in RLHF reward modeling. Central to our approach is a counterfactual data augmentation method that generates response pairs designed to isolate content quality from verbosity. These counterfactual examples are then used to train the reward model, enabling it to assess responses based on content quality independently of verbosity. Specifically, we construct (1) length-divergent pairs with similar content and (2) content-divergent pairs of similar length. Empirical evaluations show that our method reduces length bias in reward assignment and leads to more concise, content-focused outputs from the policy model. These findings demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively reduces length bias and improves the robustness and content sensitivity of reward modeling in RLHF pipelines.

Motivation: 传统任务导向对话系统依赖定制后端API，而现实世界中普遍存在前端GUI且缺乏定制API，这造成了实际应用中的显著差距。

Method: 开发网页风格GUI，将原始数据集中的对话状态和系统动作转换为GUI操作指令，收集网页快照和对应操作指令，并提出多模态基线模型MATE。

Result: 创建了MMWOZ数据集，提出了MATE模型作为基线，并进行了全面的实验分析来研究实用多模态任务导向对话代理的构建。

Conclusion: MMWOZ数据集和MATE模型为构建实用的多模态任务导向对话系统提供了基础，有助于弥合传统系统与实际应用之间的差距。

Abstract: Task-oriented dialogue systems have garnered significant attention due to their conversational ability to accomplish goals, such as booking airline tickets for users. Traditionally, task-oriented dialogue systems are conceptualized as intelligent agents that interact with users using natural language and have access to customized back-end APIs. However, in real-world scenarios, the widespread presence of front-end Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) and the absence of customized back-end APIs create a significant gap for traditional task-oriented dialogue systems in practical applications. In this paper, to bridge the gap, we collect MMWOZ, a new multimodal dialogue dataset that is extended from MultiWOZ 2.3 dataset. Specifically, we begin by developing a web-style GUI to serve as the front-end. Next, we devise an automated script to convert the dialogue states and system actions from the original dataset into operation instructions for the GUI. Lastly, we collect snapshots of the web pages along with their corresponding operation instructions. In addition, we propose a novel multimodal model called MATE (Multimodal Agent for Task-oriEnted dialogue) as the baseline model for the MMWOZ dataset. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive experimental analysis using MATE to investigate the construction of a practical multimodal agent for task-oriented dialogue.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常出现模式崩溃，即使存在多个有效答案也重复生成相同的少数补全，限制了在各种任务中的多样性。

Method: GAPO是GRPO的简单扩展，计算整个组的奖励，能够从组级属性（如多样性和覆盖度）中学习。使用频率感知奖励函数鼓励在有效LLM补全上均匀采样。

Result: GAPO训练的模型产生有效且更多样化的响应，在开放提示下也能泛化，并在标准LLM基准测试（GSM8K、MATH、HumanEval、MMLU-Pro）上提高响应多样性而不影响准确性。

Conclusion: GAPO能有效解决LLM的模式崩溃问题，提高生成内容的多样性，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffer from mode collapse, repeatedly generating the same few completions even when many valid answers exist, limiting their diversity across a wide range of tasks. We introduce Group-Aware Policy Optimization (GAPO), a simple extension of the recent and popular Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that computes rewards over the group as a whole. GAPO enables learning from the group-level properties such as diversity and coverage. We demonstrate GAPO using a frequency-aware reward function that encourages uniform sampling over valid LLM completions, and show that GAPO-trained models produce valid and more diverse model responses. Beyond this setup, GAPO generalizes to open-ended prompts and improves response diversity without compromising accuracy on standard LLM benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, HumanEval, MMLU-Pro). Our code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: We present Uni-MoE 2.0 from the Lychee family. As a fully open-source omnimodal large model (OLM), it substantially advances Lychee's Uni-MoE series in language-centric multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generating. Based on the Qwen2.5-7B dense architecture, we build Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni from scratch through three core contributions: dynamic-capacity Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design, a progressive training strategy enhanced with an iterative reinforcement strategy, and a carefully curated multimodal data matching technique. It is capable of omnimodal understanding, as well as generating images, text, and speech. Architecturally, our new MoE framework balances computational efficiency and capability for 10 cross-modal inputs using shared, routed, and null experts, while our Omni-Modality 3D RoPE ensures spatio-temporal cross-modality alignment in the self-attention layer. For training, following cross-modal pretraining, we use a progressive supervised fine-tuning strategy that activates modality-specific experts and is enhanced by balanced data composition and an iterative GSPO-DPO method to stabilise RL training and improve reasoning. Data-wise, the base model, trained on approximately 75B tokens of open-source multimodal data, is equipped with special speech and image generation tokens, allowing it to learn these generative tasks by conditioning its outputs on linguistic cues. Extensive evaluation across 85 benchmarks demonstrates that our model achieves SOTA or highly competitive performance against leading OLMs, surpassing Qwen2.5-Omni (trained with 1.2T tokens) on over 50 of 76 benchmarks. Key strengths include video understanding (+7% avg. of 8), omnimodallity understanding (+7% avg. of 4), and audiovisual reasoning (+4%). It also advances long-form speech processing (reducing WER by 4.2%) and leads in low-level image processing and controllable generation across 5 metrics.

Abstract: Notice to Air Missions (NOTAMs) serve as a critical channel for disseminating key flight safety information, yet their complex linguistic structures and implicit reasoning pose significant challenges for automated parsing. Existing research mainly focuses on surface-level tasks such as classification and named entity recognition, lacking deep semantic understanding. To address this gap, we propose NOTAM semantic parsing, a task emphasizing semantic inference and the integration of aviation domain knowledge to produce structured, inference-rich outputs. To support this task, we construct Knots (Knowledge and NOTAM Semantics), a high-quality dataset of 12,347 expert-annotated NOTAMs covering 194 Flight Information Regions, enhanced through a multi-agent collaborative framework for comprehensive field discovery. We systematically evaluate a wide range of prompt-engineering strategies and model-adaptation techniques, achieving substantial improvements in aviation text understanding and processing. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and offer valuable insights for automated NOTAM analysis systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFT方法存在"忠实度差距"，LLM强大的参数先验会覆盖上下文事实，导致关键事实幻觉，如从"NASA"错误推理出"休斯顿"。

Method: 提出Reason-KE++框架，包含阶段感知奖励机制，为中间推理步骤（如分解、子答案正确性）提供密集监督，避免仅基于结果的RL陷阱。

Result: 在MQUAKE-CF-3k上达到95.48%的准确率（提升5.28%），而仅基于结果的RL方法会破坏推理完整性（跳跃准确率仅19.00%）。

Conclusion: 对于复杂任务，对齐推理过程对于构建可信赖的LLM至关重要，过程感知框架是解决LLM对齐核心问题的关键。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) to be faithful to new knowledge in complex, multi-hop reasoning tasks is a critical, yet unsolved, challenge. We find that SFT-based methods, e.g., Reason-KE, while state-of-the-art, suffer from a "faithfulness gap": they optimize for format mimicry rather than sound reasoning. This gap enables the LLM's powerful parametric priors to override new contextual facts, resulting in critical factual hallucinations (e.g., incorrectly reasoning "Houston" from "NASA" despite an explicit edit). To solve this core LLM alignment problem, we propose Reason-KE++, an SFT+RL framework that instills process-level faithfulness. Its core is a Stage-aware Reward mechanism that provides dense supervision for intermediate reasoning steps (e.g., Decomposition, Sub-answer Correctness). Crucially, we identify that naive outcome-only RL is a deceptive trap for LLM alignment: it collapses reasoning integrity (e.g., 19.00% Hop acc) while superficially boosting final accuracy. Our process-aware framework sets a new SOTA of 95.48% on MQUAKE-CF-3k (+5.28%), demonstrating that for complex tasks, aligning the reasoning process is essential for building trustworthy LLMs.

Method: 系统包含三个组件：基于conformer的编码器、因果transformer解码器和基于单元的神经声码器。通过使用大语言模型翻译波斯语音转录并合成英语语音，构建了合成平行语料库，将可用数据增加了约6倍。

Result: 在CVSS语料库的波斯语-英语部分，该模型相比直接基线在ASR BLEU上提升了4.6分，表明合成数据对性能有显著改善。

Conclusion: 结合自监督预训练、离散语音单元和合成平行数据的方法对于波斯语-英语等低资源语言对的直接语音翻译是有效的。

Abstract: Direct speech-to-speech translation (S2ST), in which all components are trained jointly, is an attractive alternative to cascaded systems because it offers a simpler pipeline and lower inference latency. However, direct S2ST models require large amounts of parallel speech data in the source and target languages, which are rarely available for low-resource languages such as Persian. This paper presents a direct S2ST system for translating Persian speech into English speech, as well as a pipeline for synthetic parallel Persian-English speech generation. The model comprises three components: (1) a conformer-based encoder, initialized from self-supervised pre-training, maps source speech to high-level acoustic representations; (2) a causal transformer decoder with relative position multi-head attention translates these representations into discrete target speech units; (3) a unit-based neural vocoder generates waveforms from the predicted discrete units. To mitigate the data scarcity problem, we construct a new Persian-English parallel speech corpus by translating Persian speech transcriptions into English using a large language model and then synthesizing the corresponding English speech with a state-of-the-art zero-shot text-to-speech system. The resulting corpus increases the amount of available parallel speech by roughly a factor of six. On the Persian-English portion of the CVSS corpus, the proposed model achieves improvement of 4.6 ASR BLEU with the synthetic data over direct baselines. These results indicate that combining self-supervised pre-training, discrete speech units, and synthetic parallel data is effective for improving direct S2ST in low-resource language pairs such as Persian-English

TL;DR: EvoSynth是一个自主框架，通过进化合成代码攻击算法来突破LLM的安全防护，实现了85.5%的攻击成功率，超越了现有方法的创造力限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化红队框架存在根本性局限：其越狱逻辑仅限于选择、组合或改进已有的攻击策略，无法自主发明全新的攻击机制，限制了创造力。

Method: 采用多智能体系统自主设计、进化和执行基于代码的新型攻击算法，关键特征是具有代码级自校正循环，能够根据失败情况迭代重写自身攻击逻辑。

Result: 在对抗高度鲁棒模型如Claude-Sonnet-4.5时达到85.5%的攻击成功率，生成的攻击比现有方法更加多样化，建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: EvoSynth成功实现了从攻击规划到进化合成越狱方法的范式转变，为进化合成越狱方法的新研究方向提供了基础。

Abstract: Automated red teaming frameworks for Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly sophisticated, yet they share a fundamental limitation: their jailbreak logic is confined to selecting, combining, or refining pre-existing attack strategies. This binds their creativity and leaves them unable to autonomously invent entirely new attack mechanisms. To overcome this gap, we introduce \textbf{EvoSynth}, an autonomous framework that shifts the paradigm from attack planning to the evolutionary synthesis of jailbreak methods. Instead of refining prompts, EvoSynth employs a multi-agent system to autonomously engineer, evolve, and execute novel, code-based attack algorithms. Crucially, it features a code-level self-correction loop, allowing it to iteratively rewrite its own attack logic in response to failure. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that EvoSynth not only establishes a new state-of-the-art by achieving an 85.5\% Attack Success Rate (ASR) against highly robust models like Claude-Sonnet-4.5, but also generates attacks that are significantly more diverse than those from existing methods. We release our framework to facilitate future research in this new direction of evolutionary synthesis of jailbreak methods. Code is available at: https://github.com/dongdongunique/EvoSynth.

TL;DR: AFM是一种动态上下文管理器，通过三种保真度级别（完整、压缩、占位符）来优化多轮对话中的内存使用，在保持安全性能的同时显著减少token使用量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在多轮对话中固定上下文窗口和简单内存策略的瓶颈问题，避免静态摘要或仅基于最近性的启发式方法丢失关键安全细节。

Method: 基于语义相似度、半衰期最近性加权和重要性分类，为每条历史消息分配三种保真度级别，在严格token预算下按时间顺序打包消息。

Result: 在涉及花生过敏用户规划泰国旅行的安全导向基准测试中，AFM在短中长度对话中保持过敏信息，安全性能与完整重放相当，平均token使用量比基线减少66%。

Conclusion: AFM提供了一种模块化实现，可在不牺牲安全性或事实连续性的情况下显著降低推理成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-turn dialogue settings, but their behavior is still bottlenecked by fixed context windows and naive memory strategies. Replaying the full conversation at every turn is simple but expensive, while static summarization or recency-only heuristics often erase safety-critical user details. We present Adaptive Focus Memory (AFM), a dynamic context manager that assigns each past message one of three fidelity levels -- FULL, COMPRESSED, or PLACEHOLDER -- based on semantic similarity to the current query, half-life recency weighting, and importance classification. AFM packs messages chronologically under a strict token budget, preferring high fidelity for the most relevant turns while aiming to preserve a cheap trace of the dialogue. In a safety-oriented benchmark involving a user with a severe peanut allergy planning a trip to Thailand, AFM retains the allergy across both short and medium-length conversations, matches the safety performance of naive replay, and cuts average token usage by 66% relative to a replay baseline. We release a modular Python implementation of AFM designed for OpenAI-compatible APIs and offline operation, enabling practitioners to reduce inference cost without sacrificing safety or factual continuity in the evaluated scenario.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在简单推理任务中的失败模式，以揭示其可靠性和可解释性问题，通过简单任务进行大规模可控实验。

Method: 使用集合成员查询任务，系统评估提示措辞、语义结构、元素顺序和模型选择等维度，进行大规模实证分析。

Result: LLMs在这一基本任务上表现持续脆弱，在所有维度上都不可预测，表明模型对集合概念的理解是碎片化和复杂的。

Conclusion: 通过简单问题的大规模实验可以全面映射和分析失败模式，这种方法对LLM评估具有重要价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve superhuman performance on complex reasoning tasks, yet often fail on much simpler problems, raising concerns about their reliability and interpretability. We investigate this paradox through a focused study with two key design features: simplicity, to expose basic failure modes, and scale, to enable comprehensive controlled experiments. We focus on set membership queries -- among the most fundamental forms of reasoning -- using tasks like ``Is apple an element of the set \{pear, plum, apple, raspberry\}?''. We conduct a systematic empirical evaluation across prompt phrasing, semantic structure, element ordering, and model choice. Our large-scale analysis reveals that LLM performance on this elementary task is consistently brittle, and unpredictable across all dimensions, suggesting that the models' ``understanding'' of the set concept is fragmented and convoluted at best. Our work demonstrates that the large-scale experiments enabled by the simplicity of the problem allow us to map and analyze the failure modes comprehensively, making this approach a valuable methodology for LLM evaluation in general.

TL;DR: 研究发现语言模型训练中存在相变重组现象，即使在小模型中也能观察到，可在线性训练空间中直接检测，且发生在训练早期阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索相变是否仅存在于大语言模型，能否在线性训练空间直接检测，以及是否在训练早期就出现。

Method: 训练小型GPT风格transformer，分析词汇使用演变，跟踪平均词长、正确/错误词数量、词汇多样性变化，应用泊松和亚泊松统计量化词汇连接和重组。

Result: 发现训练过程中存在明显的相变点，这些转变在标准损失或验证曲线中不明显，但通过词汇和统计探针可见。

Conclusion: 相变重组是语言模型训练的普遍特征，可在适度模型中观察到，在线性训练空间中可检测，并在连贯性出现的早期阶段发生。

Abstract: Phase transitions have been proposed as the origin of emergent abilities in large language models (LLMs), where new capabilities appear abruptly once models surpass critical thresholds of scale. Prior work, such as that of Wei et al., demonstrated these phenomena under model and data scaling, with transitions revealed after applying a log scale to training compute. In this work, we ask three complementary questions: (1) Are phase transitions unique to large models, or can they also be observed in small transformer-based language models? (2) Can such transitions be detected directly in linear training space, rather than only after log rescaling? and (3) Can these transitions emerge at early stages of training? To investigate, we train a small GPT-style transformer on a character-level corpus and analyze the evolution of vocabulary usage throughout training. We track the average word length, the number of correct versus incorrect words, and shifts in vocabulary diversity. Building on these measures, we apply Poisson and sub-Poisson statistics to quantify how words connect and reorganize. This combined analysis reveals a distinct transition point during training. Notably, these transitions are not apparent in standard loss or validation curves, but become visible through our vocabulary- and statistics-based probes. Our findings suggest that phase-transition reorganizations are a general feature of language model training, observable even in modest models, detectable directly in linear training space, and occurring surprisingly early as coherence emerges. This perspective provides new insight into the nonlinear dynamics of language model training and underscores the importance of tailored metrics for uncovering phase transition behaviors

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM对齐研究主要关注通过训练和提示来提高模型对抗攻击的鲁棒性，但缺乏随着用户输入长度增加而扩展的对齐方法。研究发现LLM越狱概率随用户输入或对话长度增加而上升。

Method: 提出中断机制，即在用户输入中每x个token添加控制语句。这种方法可以推广到思维链过程中以防止欺骗行为。

Result: 论文提出了中断作为解决对齐性随输入长度扩展问题的可能方案，但未提供具体实验结果。

Conclusion: 中断机制是增强LLM对齐性的一个有前景的方法，特别是在处理长输入时，可以防止模型越狱和欺骗行为。

Abstract: Current Large Language Model alignment research mostly focuses on improving model robustness against adversarial attacks and misbehavior by training on examples and prompting. Research has shown that LLM jailbreak probability increases with the size of the user input or conversation length. There is a lack of appropriate research into means of strengthening alignment which also scale with user input length. We propose interruptions as a possible solution to this problem. Interruptions are control sentences added to the user input approximately every x tokens for some arbitrary x. We suggest that this can be generalized to the Chain-of-Thought process to prevent scheming.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在文本到SQL任务中对自然语言输入的改写很敏感，本研究旨在验证这种敏感性是否也存在于自动形式化领域。

Method: 使用MiniF2F和ProofNet基准测试，生成语义相似但措辞不同的自然语言陈述，在两个现代LLMs上进行交叉评估，测量语义和编译有效性。

Result: 结果显示模型在改写输入上的性能存在变异性，自然语言陈述的微小变化会显著影响模型输出。

Conclusion: LLMs在自动形式化任务中对输入表述的变化很敏感，这揭示了模型鲁棒性的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for autoformalization. Despite their impressive performance, these models can still struggle to produce grounded and verifiable formalizations. Recent work in text-to-SQL, has revealed that LLMs can be sensitive to paraphrased natural language (NL) inputs, even when high degrees of semantic fidelity are preserved (Safarzadeh, Oroojlooyjadid, and Roth 2025). In this paper, we investigate this claim in the autoformalization domain. Specifically, we evaluate the robustness of LLMs generating formal proofs with semantically similar paraphrased NL statements by measuring semantic and compilation validity. Using the formal benchmarks MiniF2F (Zheng, Han, and Polu 2021) and Lean 4 version of ProofNet (Xin et al. 2024), and two modern LLMs, we generate paraphrased natural language statements and cross-evaluate these statements across both models. The results of this paper reveal performance variability across paraphrased inputs, demonstrating that minor shifts in NL statements can significantly impact model outputs.

TL;DR: BioMedJImpact是一个大规模生物医学期刊影响数据集，整合了文献计量指标、合作特征和基于LLM的AI参与度指标，用于分析合作强度和AI参与度如何共同影响科学影响力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放资源很少捕捉合作结构和AI研究如何共同塑造生物医学领域期刊声望，需要开发综合数据集来推进期刊层面的科学影响力和AI参与度分析。

Method: 从PubMed Central的174万篇文章构建数据集，提出可复现的三阶段LLM流程提取AI参与度特征，分析合作强度和AI参与度在疫情前后对科学影响力的共同影响。

Result: 发现两个一致趋势：合作强度更高的期刊（特别是作者团队更大更多样化的）获得更高引用影响力；AI参与度与期刊声望相关性日益增强，尤其在四分位排名中。人类评估验证了AI相关性检测和子领域分类的一致性。

Conclusion: BioMedJImpact既是捕捉生物医学与AI交叉的综合数据集，也是经过验证的方法框架，支持可扩展的、内容感知的科学计量分析。

Abstract: Assessing journal impact is central to scholarly communication, yet existing open resources rarely capture how collaboration structures and artificial intelligence (AI) research jointly shape venue prestige in biomedicine. We present BioMedJImpact, a large-scale, biomedical-oriented dataset designed to advance journal-level analysis of scientific impact and AI engagement. Built from 1.74 million PubMed Central articles across 2,744 journals, BioMedJImpact integrates bibliometric indicators, collaboration features, and LLM-derived semantic indicators for AI engagement. Specifically, the AI engagement feature is extracted through a reproducible three-stage LLM pipeline that we propose. Using this dataset, we analyze how collaboration intensity and AI engagement jointly influence scientific impact across pre- and post-pandemic periods (2016-2019, 2020-2023). Two consistent trends emerge: journals with higher collaboration intensity, particularly those with larger and more diverse author teams, tend to achieve greater citation impact, and AI engagement has become an increasingly strong correlate of journal prestige, especially in quartile rankings. To further validate the three-stage LLM pipeline we proposed for deriving the AI engagement feature, we conduct human evaluation, confirming substantial agreement in AI relevance detection and consistent subfield classification. Together, these contributions demonstrate that BioMedJImpact serves as both a comprehensive dataset capturing the intersection of biomedicine and AI, and a validated methodological framework enabling scalable, content-aware scientometric analysis of scientific impact and innovation dynamics.

TL;DR: 通过激活工程方法，在LLaMA 3.1-8B模型中实现更人性化的情感表达，无需大量微调即可增强对话的情感特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在对话流畅性方面不断提升，但赋予其细腻、人性化的情感表达仍面临挑战。现有的对齐技术往往只处理表层输出或需要大量微调。

Method: 首先使用归因修补识别因果影响组件，通过对比文本对（正负情感示例）的激活差异推导情感表达向量，然后将这些向量应用于新的对话提示。

Result: 引导后的响应显示积极情感（如喜悦、信任）增强，第一人称代词使用频率增加，表明更高的个人参与度。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一个精确且可解释的框架，为对话AI研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate increasing conversational fluency, yet instilling them with nuanced, human-like emotional expression remains a significant challenge. Current alignment techniques often address surface-level output or require extensive fine-tuning. This paper demonstrates that targeted activation engineering can steer LLaMA 3.1-8B to exhibit more human-like emotional nuances. We first employ attribution patching to identify causally influential components, to find a key intervention locus by observing activation patterns during diagnostic conversational tasks. We then derive emotional expression vectors from the difference in the activations generated by contrastive text pairs (positive vs. negative examples of target emotions). Applying these vectors to new conversational prompts significantly enhances emotional characteristics: steered responses show increased positive sentiment (e.g., joy, trust) and more frequent first-person pronoun usage, indicative of greater personal engagement. Our findings offer a precise and interpretable framework and new directions for the study of conversational AI.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的稳定性度量方法，通过LDA的生成特性创建带真实主题的语料库，评估LDA在多次运行中的一致性，发现LDA能正确识别主题数量但无法准确还原真实主题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概率主题模型因其随机性在多次运行时会产生不一致的结果，影响可复现性、可靠性和解释性，需要评估这些模型是否能捕捉有意义的主题还是仅仅噪声。

Method: 定义新的稳定性度量方法，结合准确性和一致性，利用LDA的生成特性创建带真实主题的语料库，并对这些语料库运行LDA 50次以评估输出变异性。

Result: LDA能够正确确定文档中的基础主题数量，多次重新运行返回相似主题，具有较好的内部一致性，但这些主题并非真实主题。

Conclusion: LDA在识别主题数量方面表现良好且具有内部一致性，但无法准确还原真实主题，表明模型稳定性与主题准确性之间存在差异。

Abstract: Topic modelling in Natural Language Processing uncovers hidden topics in large, unlabelled text datasets. It is widely applied in fields such as information retrieval, content summarisation, and trend analysis across various disciplines. However, probabilistic topic models can produce different results when rerun due to their stochastic nature, leading to inconsistencies in latent topics. Factors like corpus shuffling, rare text removal, and document elimination contribute to these variations. This instability affects replicability, reliability, and interpretation, raising concerns about whether topic models capture meaningful topics or just noise. To address these problems, we defined a new stability measure that incorporates accuracy and consistency and uses the generative properties of LDA to generate a new corpus with ground truth. These generated corpora are run through LDA 50 times to determine the variability in the output. We show that LDA can correctly determine the underlying number of topics in the documents. We also find that LDA is more internally consistent, as the multiple reruns return similar topics; however, these topics are not the true topics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用语言模型无法捕捉临床脑电图报告中的领域特定语言惯例，需要专门针对EEG报告特点的模型。

Method: 使用哈佛脑电图数据库的纯文本报告进行训练，采用span-corruption预训练和指令式微调，包括报告润色、段落摘要和术语问答任务。

Result: 相比同规模通用模型，NeuroLex实现了更低的困惑度、更高的提取和摘要准确率、更好的标签效率，以及对否定和事实幻觉更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NeuroLex为脑电图文本建模和脑机接口应用提供了桥梁，为可解释和语言驱动的神经解码奠定了基础。

Abstract: Clinical electroencephalogram (EEG) reports encode domain-specific linguistic conventions that general-purpose language models (LMs) fail to capture. We introduce NeuroLex, a lightweight domain-adaptive language model trained purely on EEG report text from the Harvard Electroencephalography Database. Unlike existing biomedical LMs, NeuroLex is tailored to the linguistic and diagnostic characteristics of EEG reporting, enabling it to serve as both an independent textual model and a decoder backbone for multimodal EEG-language systems. Using span-corruption pretraining and instruction-style fine-tuning on report polishing, paragraph summarization, and terminology question answering, NeuroLex learns the syntax and reasoning patterns characteristic of EEG interpretation. Comprehensive evaluations show that it achieves lower perplexity, higher extraction and summarization accuracy, better label efficiency, and improved robustness to negation and factual hallucination compared with general models of the same scale. With an EEG-aware linguistic backbone, NeuroLex bridges biomedical text modeling and brain-computer interface applications, offering a foundation for interpretable and language-driven neural decoding.

Abstract: With the remarkable success of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in perception tasks, enhancing their complex reasoning capabilities has emerged as a critical research focus. Existing models still suffer from challenges such as opaque reasoning paths and insufficient generalization ability. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, which has demonstrated significant efficacy in language models by enhancing reasoning transparency and output interpretability, holds promise for improving model reasoning capabilities when extended to the multimodal domain. This paper provides a systematic review centered on "Multimodal Chain-of-Thought" (MCoT). First, it analyzes the background and theoretical motivations for its inception from the perspectives of technical evolution and task demands. Then, it introduces mainstream MCoT methods from three aspects: CoT paradigms, the post-training stage, and the inference stage, while also analyzing their underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, the paper summarizes existing evaluation benchmarks and metrics, and discusses the application scenarios of MCoT. Finally, it analyzes the challenges currently facing MCoT and provides an outlook on its future research directions.

Motivation: 开发一个计算框架来分析文本中的希望表达，应用于心理健康和社交媒体分析领域，探索不同Transformer架构在专业情感检测任务中的适用性。

Method: 使用三种Transformer架构（BERT、GPT-2、DeBERTa）进行二分类（希望vs非希望）和多分类（五个希望相关类别）任务，比较其准确性和计算效率。

Result: BERT表现最佳（二分类84.49%，多分类72.03%），且计算效率最高（训练时间443s）；GPT-2准确率最低（79.34%二分类），但在讽刺检测方面表现出色（92.46%召回率）；DeBERTa表现中等但计算成本最高（多分类训练947s）。

Conclusion: 对于专业的情感检测任务，架构的适用性可能比模型规模更重要，BERT在希望表达分类任务中提供了最佳的性能与效率平衡。

Abstract: This paper presents a transformer-based approach for classifying hope expressions in text. We developed and compared three architectures (BERT, GPT-2, and DeBERTa) for both binary classification (Hope vs. Not Hope) and multiclass categorization (five hope-related categories). Our initial BERT implementation achieved 83.65% binary and 74.87% multiclass accuracy. In the extended comparison, BERT demonstrated superior performance (84.49% binary, 72.03% multiclass accuracy) while requiring significantly fewer computational resources (443s vs. 704s training time) than newer architectures. GPT-2 showed lowest overall accuracy (79.34% binary, 71.29% multiclass), while DeBERTa achieved moderate results (80.70% binary, 71.56% multiclass) but at substantially higher computational cost (947s for multiclass training). Error analysis revealed architecture-specific strengths in detecting nuanced hope expressions, with GPT-2 excelling at sarcasm detection (92.46% recall). This study provides a framework for computational analysis of hope, with applications in mental health and social media analysis, while demonstrating that architectural suitability may outweigh model size for specialized emotion detection tasks.

Motivation: 评估AI生成内容在健康信息搜索中的质量，特别是AI概览和精选摘要功能，这些功能用户依赖度高但无法控制其呈现方式。

Method: 对1,508个真实婴儿护理和孕期相关查询进行系统算法审计，使用多维度质量评估框架分析答案一致性、相关性、医疗安全提示、来源类别和情感对齐。

Result: AI概览和精选摘要在同一搜索结果页中的信息不一致率达33%；医疗安全提示严重缺乏（AI概览仅11%，精选摘要仅7%）；健康网站是主要来源，但精选摘要也常链接商业来源。

Conclusion: AI介导的健康信息存在质量隐患，需要更强的质量控制，特别是在直接影响用户福祉的高风险领域。

Abstract: Google Search increasingly surfaces AI-generated content through features like AI Overviews (AIO) and Featured Snippets (FS), which users frequently rely on despite having no control over their presentation. Through a systematic algorithm audit of 1,508 real baby care and pregnancy-related queries, we evaluate the quality and consistency of these information displays. Our robust evaluation framework assesses multiple quality dimensions, including answer consistency, relevance, presence of medical safeguards, source categories, and sentiment alignment. Our results reveal concerning gaps in information consistency, with information in AIO and FS displayed on the same search result page being inconsistent with each other in 33% of cases. Despite high relevance scores, both features critically lack medical safeguards (present in just 11% of AIO and 7% of FS responses). While health and wellness websites dominate source categories for both, AIO and FS, FS also often link to commercial sources. These findings have important implications for public health information access and demonstrate the need for stronger quality controls in AI-mediated health information. Our methodology provides a transferable framework for auditing AI systems across high-stakes domains where information quality directly impacts user well-being.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了视觉房间论证，认为多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)可能精确描述视觉细节但无法理解潜在情感和意图，即"看见不等于理解"。作者构建了Visual Room 2.0基准来评估MLLMs的感知-认知对齐，包含350个多模态样本和2,100个问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Searle的中文房间思想扩展到多模态领域，质疑MLLMs是否真正理解所见内容，认为模型可能具备感知能力但缺乏认知理解。

Method: 构建分层基准Visual Room 2.0，模拟人类感知和认知过程的三个层次（低、中、高），涵盖17个代表性任务，包含350个多模态样本，每个样本有6个渐进式问题。

Result: 评估10个最先进的MLLMs发现：(1) MLLMs的感知能力比认知能力更强（高出8.0%）；(2) 认知似乎不因果依赖于基于感知的推理；(3) 认知随模型规模扩展，但感知能力在更大变体中并未一致提升。

Conclusion: 该工作将"看见≠理解"操作化为可测试假设，为MLLMs从感知处理到认知推理提供了新范式，揭示了MLLMs在感知-认知对齐方面的局限性。

Abstract: Can multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) truly understand what they can see? Extending Searle's Chinese Room into the multi-modal domain, this paper proposes the Visual Room argument: MLLMs may describe every visual detail precisely yet fail to comprehend the underlying emotions and intentions, namely seeing is not understanding. Building on this, we introduce \textit{Visual Room} 2.0, a hierarchical benchmark for evaluating perception-cognition alignment of MLLMs. We model human perceptive and cognitive processes across three levels: low, middle, and high, covering 17 representative tasks. The perception component ranges from attribute recognition to scene understanding, while the cognition component extends from textual entailment to causal and social reasoning. The dataset contains 350 multi-modal samples, each with six progressive questions (2,100 in total) spanning perception to cognition. Evaluating 10 state-of-the-art (SoTA) MLLMs, we highlight three key findings: (1) MLLMs exhibit stronger perceptual competence than cognitive ability (8.0\%$\uparrow$); (2) cognition appears not causally dependent on perception-based reasoning; and (3) cognition scales with model size, but perception does not consistently improve with larger variants. This work operationalizes Seeing $\ne$ Understanding as a testable hypothesis, offering a new paradigm from perceptual processing to cognitive reasoning in MLLMs. Our dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/LHK2003/PCBench.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HCNR方法通过识别和恢复关键表达控制神经元，有效修复SFT后LLM的诚实度，相比基线方法数据需求减少10倍以上，速度提升2.23倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调严重削弱了LLM的诚实性，这对高风险领域的安全部署至关重要。现有恢复方法假设SFT深度破坏了模型识别知识边界的能力，但研究发现微调后的LLM仍保留此能力，受损的是忠实表达这种意识的能力。

Method: 提出Honesty-Critical Neurons Restoration (HCNR)方法，通过手术式修复被抑制的表达能力。识别并恢复关键表达控制神经元到预训练状态，同时通过Hessian引导的补偿机制使其与任务导向神经元协调。

Result: 在四个QA任务和五个LLM家族上的实验表明，HCNR有效恢复了33.25%的受损诚实度，相比基线方法实现至少2.23倍加速，数据需求减少10倍以上。

Conclusion: HCNR为可信赖LLM部署提供了实用解决方案，通过精准神经元修复而非全局参数调整，有效平衡诚实性与任务性能。

Abstract: The honesty of Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly important for safe deployment in high-stakes domains. However, this crucial trait is severely undermined by supervised fine-tuning (SFT), a common technique for model specialization. Existing recovery methods rely on data-intensive global parameter adjustments, implicitly assuming that SFT deeply corrupts the models' ability to recognize their knowledge boundaries. However, we observe that fine-tuned LLMs still preserve this ability; what is damaged is their capacity to faithfully express that awareness. Building on this, we propose Honesty-Critical Neurons Restoration (HCNR) to surgically repair this suppressed capacity. HCNR identifies and restores key expression-governing neurons to their pre-trained state while harmonizing them with task-oriented neurons via Hessian-guided compensation. Experiments on four QA tasks and five LLM families demonstrate that HCNR effectively recovers 33.25% of the compromised honesty while achieving at least 2.23x speedup with over 10x less data compared to baseline methods, offering a practical solution for trustworthy LLM deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AA-Omniscience基准测试评估语言模型的事实回忆能力和知识校准能力，发现前沿模型在事实性和校准方面存在持续弱点，Claude 4.1 Opus表现最佳但分数仍很低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型评估主要衡量通用能力，但在各领域可靠使用需要事实准确性和识别知识差距的能力。

Method: 构建包含6,000个问题的基准测试，问题来自权威学术和行业来源，涵盖6个领域的42个经济相关主题，测量模型的Omniscience指数。

Result: Claude 4.1 Opus获得最高分(4.8)，是仅有的三个得分超过0的模型之一。不同模型在不同领域表现各异，三个不同研究实验室的模型在六个领域分别领先。

Conclusion: 模型在知识重要任务中应根据用例需求而非通用性能来选择，因为模型在不同领域的表现存在显著差异。

Abstract: Existing language model evaluations primarily measure general capabilities, yet reliable use of these models across a range of domains demands factual accuracy and recognition of knowledge gaps. We introduce AA-Omniscience, a benchmark designed to measure both factual recall and knowledge calibration across 6,000 questions. Questions are derived from authoritative academic and industry sources, and cover 42 economically relevant topics within six different domains. The evaluation measures a model's Omniscience Index, a bounded metric (-100 to 100) measuring factual recall that jointly penalizes hallucinations and rewards abstention when uncertain, with 0 equating to a model that answers questions correctly as much as it does incorrectly. Among evaluated models, Claude 4.1 Opus attains the highest score (4.8), making it one of only three models to score above zero. These results reveal persistent factuality and calibration weaknesses across frontier models. Performance also varies by domain, with the models from three different research labs leading across the six domains. This performance variability suggests models should be chosen according to the demands of the use case rather than general performance for tasks where knowledge is important.

*Kasun Wickramasinghe,Nisansa de Silva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了多语言嵌入模型与对齐单语模型在双语词典归纳任务中的表现差异，分析了BLI作为嵌入空间对齐度评估指标的局限性，并提出基于词干的新BLI方法和词汇修剪技术来改进评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然多语言嵌入已成为主流选择，但需要验证其是否在所有方面都优于对齐单语模型，以及高昂的计算成本是否总是合理。BLI作为评估嵌入空间对齐度的常用指标存在局限性。

Method: 使用传统嵌入对齐技术、新型多语言模型和组合对齐技术，在高资源和低资源语言环境下进行BLI任务评估，并考察语言家族的影响。提出基于词干的BLI方法和词汇修剪技术。

Result: 组合嵌入对齐技术通常表现更好，但在某些情况下（主要是低资源语言）多语言嵌入表现更优。BLI在某些情况下不能准确衡量对齐度。

Conclusion: 多语言嵌入和对齐单语模型各有优势，需要根据具体场景选择。提出的基于词干的BLI方法和词汇修剪技术能更准确地评估嵌入空间对齐度。

Abstract: Sans a dwindling number of monolingual embedding studies originating predominantly from the low-resource domains, it is evident that multilingual embedding has become the de facto choice due to its adaptability to the usage of code-mixed languages, granting the ability to process multilingual documents in a language-agnostic manner, as well as removing the difficult task of aligning monolingual embeddings. But is this victory complete? Are the multilingual models better than aligned monolingual models in every aspect? Can the higher computational cost of multilingual models always be justified? Or is there a compromise between the two extremes? Bilingual Lexicon Induction is one of the most widely used metrics in terms of evaluating the degree of alignment between two embedding spaces. In this study, we explore the strengths and limitations of BLI as a measure to evaluate the degree of alignment of two embedding spaces. Further, we evaluate how well traditional embedding alignment techniques, novel multilingual models, and combined alignment techniques perform BLI tasks in the contexts of both high-resource and low-resource languages. In addition to that, we investigate the impact of the language families to which the pairs of languages belong. We identify that BLI does not measure the true degree of alignment in some cases and we propose solutions for them. We propose a novel stem-based BLI approach to evaluate two aligned embedding spaces that take into account the inflected nature of languages as opposed to the prevalent word-based BLI techniques. Further, we introduce a vocabulary pruning technique that is more informative in showing the degree of the alignment, especially performing BLI on multilingual embedding models. Often, combined embedding alignment techniques perform better while in certain cases multilingual embeddings perform better (mainly low-resource language cases).

TL;DR: Spark-Prover-X1是一个7B参数的模型，通过三阶段训练框架提升轻量级LLM的形式推理能力，在定理证明任务上达到同类开源模型的最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在自动定理证明方面表现出潜力，但受限于高质量形式语言数据的稀缺性，需要开发更有效的训练方法来提升轻量级模型的推理能力。

Method: 采用三阶段训练框架：1) 在广泛数学语料上进行持续预训练，引入"思维链增强状态预测"任务；2) 在专家迭代循环中进行监督微调；3) 应用组相对策略优化来提升解决难题的能力。

Result: Spark-Prover-X1-7B在同类开源模型中达到最优性能，平均通过率37.0%(pass@32)，在PutnamBench上解决27个问题，在CombiBench上达到24.0%。

Conclusion: 多样化的训练数据和渐进式精炼的训练流程为提升轻量级LLM的形式推理能力提供了有效路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in automated theorem proving, yet progress is often constrained by the scarcity of diverse and high-quality formal language data. To address this issue, we introduce Spark-Prover-X1, a 7B parameter model trained via an three-stage framework designed to unlock the reasoning potential of more accessible and moderately-sized LLMs. The first stage infuses deep knowledge through continuous pre-training on a broad mathematical corpus, enhanced by a suite of novel data tasks. Key innovation is a "CoT-augmented state prediction" task to achieve fine-grained reasoning. The second stage employs Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) within an expert iteration loop to specialize both the Spark-Prover-X1-7B and Spark-Formalizer-X1-7B models. Finally, a targeted round of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is applied to sharpen the prover's capabilities on the most challenging problems. To facilitate robust evaluation, particularly on problems from real-world examinations, we also introduce ExamFormal-Bench, a new benchmark dataset of 402 formal problems. Experimental results demonstrate that Spark-Prover-X1-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance among similarly-sized open-source models, attaining a 37.0\% average pass rate (pass@32). It shows exceptional performance on difficult competition benchmarks, notably solving 27 problems on PutnamBench (pass@32) and achieving 24.0\% on CombiBench (pass@32). Our work validates that this diverse training data and progressively refined training pipeline provides an effective path for enhancing the formal reasoning capabilities of lightweight LLMs. Both Spark-Prover-X1-7B and Spark-Formalizer-X1-7B, along with the ExamFormal-Bench dataset, are made publicly available at:https://www.modelscope.cn/organization/iflytek, https://gitcode.com/ifly_opensource.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着推理语言模型的发展，需要全面评估其在语篇层面的知识理解能力，包括传统任务和新挑战。

Method: 整合5个公开可用的语篇任务，涵盖语篇词汇、(多)句子和文档层面，包括语篇解析、时序关系提取、语篇粒子消歧等任务。

Result: 评估发现最先进模型在时序推理的算术方面表现强劲，但在完整文档推理和某些细微语义语篇现象（如修辞关系识别）方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 现代LLM在语篇理解方面仍有局限，特别是在复杂文档推理和细微语义现象处理上需要进一步改进。

Abstract: We introduce BeDiscovER (Benchmark of Discourse Understanding in the Era of Reasoning Language Models), an up-to-date, comprehensive suite for evaluating the discourse-level knowledge of modern LLMs. BeDiscovER compiles 5 publicly available discourse tasks across discourse lexicon, (multi-)sentential, and documental levels, with in total 52 individual datasets. It covers both extensively studied tasks such as discourse parsing and temporal relation extraction, as well as some novel challenges such as discourse particle disambiguation (e.g., ``just''), and also aggregates a shared task on Discourse Relation Parsing and Treebanking for multilingual and multi-framework discourse relation classification. We evaluate open-source LLMs: Qwen3 series, DeepSeek-R1, and frontier model such as GPT-5-mini on BeDiscovER, and find that state-of-the-art models exhibit strong performance in arithmetic aspect of temporal reasoning, but they struggle with full document reasoning and some subtle semantic and discourse phenomena, such as rhetorical relation recognition.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究系统评估了当代大语言模型在零样本设置下识别已发表RCT对CONSORT 2010声明依从性的准确性和可靠性，发现模型整体表现一般，能较好识别合规项目但难以检测不合规和不适用的项目。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动验证CONSORT依从性是一个耗时费力的过程，成为同行评审和证据合成的瓶颈，需要探索自动化解决方案。

Method: 构建了包含150篇已发表RCT的金标准数据集，在零样本设置下评估LLMs的三分类任务性能，使用宏平均F1分数作为主要指标，辅以项目级性能指标和定性错误分析。

Result: 表现最佳的Gemini-2.5-Flash和DeepSeek-R1模型宏F1分数分别为0.634，Cohen's Kappa系数分别为0.280和0.282，仅与专家共识达成一般一致性。模型在识别合规项目时表现良好（F1>0.850），但在识别不合规和不适用的项目时表现较差（F1<0.400）。

Conclusion: LLMs有潜力作为CONSORT检查的初步筛选助手，能够识别报告良好的项目，但目前无法可靠检测报告遗漏或方法学缺陷，尚不能替代人类专家在试验质量关键评估中的作用。

Abstract: The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement is the global benchmark for transparent and high-quality reporting of randomized controlled trials. Manual verification of CONSORT adherence is a laborious, time-intensive process that constitutes a significant bottleneck in peer review and evidence synthesis. This study aimed to systematically evaluate the accuracy and reliability of contemporary LLMs in identifying the adherence of published RCTs to the CONSORT 2010 statement under a zero-shot setting. We constructed a golden standard dataset of 150 published RCTs spanning diverse medical specialties. The primary outcome was the macro-averaged F1-score for the three-class classification task, supplemented by item-wise performance metrics and qualitative error analysis. Overall model performance was modest. The top-performing models, Gemini-2.5-Flash and DeepSeek-R1, achieved nearly identical macro F1 scores of 0.634 and Cohen's Kappa coefficients of 0.280 and 0.282, respectively, indicating only fair agreement with expert consensus. A striking performance disparity was observed across classes: while most models could identify compliant items with high accuracy (F1 score > 0.850), they struggled profoundly with identifying non-compliant and not applicable items, where F1 scores rarely exceeded 0.400. Notably, some high-profile models like GPT-4o underperformed, achieving a macro F1-score of only 0.521. LLMs show potential as preliminary screening assistants for CONSORT checks, capably identifying well-reported items. However, their current inability to reliably detect reporting omissions or methodological flaws makes them unsuitable for replacing human expertise in the critical appraisal of trial quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Agent-Event-Coder (AEC) 是一个多智能体框架，将事件抽取视为类似软件工程的代码生成过程，通过检索、规划、编码和验证四个专业智能体的协作，在零样本设置下实现精确、完整且符合模式的事件抽取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在零样本事件抽取中面临复杂推理和领域特定理解的挑战，直接提示往往产生不完整或结构无效的输出，如错误分类的触发器、缺失参数和模式违规。

Method: AEC 将零样本事件抽取分解为四个专业子任务：检索、规划、编码和验证，每个任务由专门的LLM智能体处理。事件模式表示为可执行的类定义，通过验证智能体实现确定性验证和精确反馈。

Result: 在五个不同领域和六个LLM上的实验表明，AEC 始终优于先前的零样本基线方法，展示了将事件抽取视为代码生成方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过将事件抽取视为结构化、迭代的代码生成过程，AEC 框架能够系统地进行消歧和模式强制执行，在零样本设置下产生精确、完整且模式一致的事件抽取结果。

Abstract: Zero-shot event extraction (ZSEE) remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs) due to the need for complex reasoning and domain-specific understanding. Direct prompting often yields incomplete or structurally invalid outputs--such as misclassified triggers, missing arguments, and schema violations. To address these limitations, we present Agent-Event-Coder (AEC), a novel multi-agent framework that treats event extraction like software engineering: as a structured, iterative code-generation process. AEC decomposes ZSEE into specialized subtasks--retrieval, planning, coding, and verification--each handled by a dedicated LLM agent. Event schemas are represented as executable class definitions, enabling deterministic validation and precise feedback via a verification agent. This programming-inspired approach allows for systematic disambiguation and schema enforcement through iterative refinement. By leveraging collaborative agent workflows, AEC enables LLMs to produce precise, complete, and schema-consistent extractions in zero-shot settings. Experiments across five diverse domains and six LLMs demonstrate that AEC consistently outperforms prior zero-shot baselines, showcasing the power of treating event extraction like code generation. The code and data are released on https://github.com/UESTC-GQJ/Agent-Event-Coder.

Motivation: 系统比较循环神经网络和注意力机制在手语识别任务中的性能差异，为架构选择提供指导。

Method: 在Azerbaijani Sign Language Dataset和Word-Level American Sign Language数据集上实现并评估ConvLSTM和Vanilla Transformer两种代表性模型。

Result: Vanilla Transformer在两个数据集上的Top-1和Top-5准确率均优于ConvLSTM，在AzSLD上达到76.8% Top-1准确率，在WLASL上达到88.3%。ConvLSTM计算效率更高但准确率较低。

Conclusion: 两种架构各有优势：Transformer在准确率和说话人独立性方面表现更好，ConvLSTM在计算效率和时序建模方面有优势，选择应根据应用需求和资源限制。

Abstract: This study presents a systematic comparative analysis of recurrent and attention-based neural architectures for isolated sign language recognition. We implement and evaluate two representative models-ConvLSTM and Vanilla Transformer-on the Azerbaijani Sign Language Dataset (AzSLD) and the Word-Level American Sign Language (WLASL) dataset. Our results demonstrate that the attention-based Vanilla Transformer consistently outperforms the recurrent ConvLSTM in both Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy across datasets, achieving up to 76.8% Top-1 accuracy on AzSLD and 88.3% on WLASL. The ConvLSTM, while more computationally efficient, lags in recognition accuracy, particularly on smaller datasets. These findings highlight the complementary strengths of each paradigm: the Transformer excels in overall accuracy and signer independence, whereas the ConvLSTM offers advantages in computational efficiency and temporal modeling. The study provides a nuanced analysis of these trade-offs, offering guidance for architecture selection in sign language recognition systems depending on application requirements and resource constraints.

TL;DR: 提出一种零样本语法能力评估框架，利用无标签数据和大型语言模型生成伪标签，通过噪声标签处理训练基于transformer的模型，实现高精度的语法能力评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 口语语法评估面临自发、非结构化、不流畅等挑战，且需要大量专家标注，大规模数据创建不切实际。

Method: 使用基于语法能力量表的提示词让LLM在无标签数据上生成预测作为伪标签，通过专门设计的训练框架处理标签噪声来训练transformer模型。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能高精度估计语法能力分数，LLM选择和干净-噪声样本比例对性能有重要影响。

Conclusion: 该方法为可扩展、低资源的语法评估系统铺平了道路，具有鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: Grammar competency estimation is essential for assessing linguistic proficiency in both written and spoken language; however, the spoken modality presents additional challenges due to its spontaneous, unstructured, and disfluent nature. Developing accurate grammar scoring models further requires extensive expert annotation, making large-scale data creation impractical. To address these limitations, we propose a zero-shot grammar competency estimation framework that leverages unlabeled data and Large Language Models (LLMs) without relying on manual labels. During training, we employ LLM-generated predictions on unlabeled data by using grammar competency rubric-based prompts. These predictions, treated as pseudo labels, are utilized to train a transformer-based model through a novel training framework designed to handle label noise effectively. We show that the choice of LLM for pseudo-label generation critically affects model performance and that the ratio of clean-to-noisy samples during training strongly influences stability and accuracy. Finally, a qualitative analysis of error intensity and score prediction confirms the robustness and interpretability of our approach. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in estimating grammar competency scores with high accuracy, paving the way for scalable, low-resource grammar assessment systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决孟加拉语ASR转录中词重复的歧义问题：区分无意的重复不流利和有意的形态学重复，避免标准不流利校正方法误删有效语言信息。

Method: 构建20,000行手动标注的孟加拉语语料库，使用两种方法：1) 多语言LLM的少样本提示；2) 对编码器模型进行任务特定微调。

Result: LLM在少样本提示下达到82.68%准确率，但微调表现更优，BanglaBERT模型达到84.78%准确率和0.677 F1分数。

Conclusion: 建立了强大的语言学基线，为开发语义保留的孟加拉语文本规范化系统提供了关键数据支持。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcripts, especially in low-resource languages like Bangla, contain a critical ambiguity: word-word repetitions can be either Repetition Disfluency (unintentional ASR error/hesitation) or Morphological Reduplication (a deliberate grammatical construct). Standard disfluency correction fails by erroneously deleting valid linguistic information. To solve this, we introduce the first publicly available, 20,000-row Bangla corpus, manually annotated to explicitly distinguish between these two phenomena in noisy ASR transcripts. We benchmark this novel resource using two paradigms: state-of-the-art multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) and task-specific fine-tuning of encoder models. LLMs achieve competitive performance (up to 82.68\% accuracy) with few-shot prompting. However, fine-tuning proves superior, with the language-specific BanglaBERT model achieving the highest accuracy of 84.78\% and an F1 score of 0.677. This establishes a strong, linguistically-informed baseline and provides essential data for developing sophisticated, semantic-preserving text normalization systems for Bangla.

TL;DR: TCM-5CEval是一个针对中医领域的更细粒度、更全面的LLM评估基准，涵盖5个关键维度：核心知识、经典文献、临床决策、中药学和临床非药物治疗。评估发现LLMs在基础知识回忆方面表现良好，但在经典文本解释和推理稳定性方面存在显著弱点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在中医等高度专业化和文化丰富的领域应用时，需要更严谨和细致的评估。基于之前TCM-3CEval的工作，发现系统性的知识差距和文化背景对齐的重要性，需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 开发了TCM-5CEval基准，包含五个评估维度：核心知识(TCM-Exam)、经典文献(TCM-LitQA)、临床决策(TCM-MRCD)、中药学(TCM-CMM)和临床非药物治疗(TCM-ClinNPT)。对15个主流LLMs进行了全面评估，并采用基于排列的一致性测试来检验推理稳定性。

Result: 评估显示显著的性能差异，deepseek_r1和gemini_2_5_pro表现最佳。模型在基础知识回忆方面表现良好，但在经典文本解释方面存在困难。关键发现是：所有模型在面对不同问题选项排序时都表现出显著的性能下降，表明普遍存在位置偏见和缺乏稳健理解。

Conclusion: TCM-5CEval不仅为LLMs在中医领域的能力提供了更详细的诊断工具，还暴露了其推理稳定性的根本弱点。该基准已上传至Medbench平台，以促进进一步研究和标准化比较。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in general domains, yet their application in highly specialized and culturally-rich fields like Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) requires rigorous and nuanced evaluation. Building upon prior foundational work such as TCM-3CEval, which highlighted systemic knowledge gaps and the importance of cultural-contextual alignment, we introduce TCM-5CEval, a more granular and comprehensive benchmark. TCM-5CEval is designed to assess LLMs across five critical dimensions: (1) Core Knowledge (TCM-Exam), (2) Classical Literacy (TCM-LitQA), (3) Clinical Decision-making (TCM-MRCD), (4) Chinese Materia Medica (TCM-CMM), and (5) Clinical Non-pharmacological Therapy (TCM-ClinNPT). We conducted a thorough evaluation of fifteen prominent LLMs, revealing significant performance disparities and identifying top-performing models like deepseek\_r1 and gemini\_2\_5\_pro. Our findings show that while models exhibit proficiency in recalling foundational knowledge, they struggle with the interpretative complexities of classical texts. Critically, permutation-based consistency testing reveals widespread fragilities in model inference. All evaluated models, including the highest-scoring ones, displayed a substantial performance degradation when faced with varied question option ordering, indicating a pervasive sensitivity to positional bias and a lack of robust understanding. TCM-5CEval not only provides a more detailed diagnostic tool for LLM capabilities in TCM but aldso exposes fundamental weaknesses in their reasoning stability. To promote further research and standardized comparison, TCM-5CEval has been uploaded to the Medbench platform, joining its predecessor in the "In-depth Challenge for Comprehensive TCM Abilities" special track.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种量化评估翻译器性能的方法，通过分析翻译熵来衡量翻译器的表现。研究发现翻译熵在解码器模块中增强，可用于对公开翻译器进行定量排名，并验证了翻译熵的对称性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在信息时代，翻译需求日益增长，但现有基于编码器-解码器深度架构的翻译器缺乏量化评估方法，主要因为单语言的熵值仍然未知。

Method: 通过给定翻译器，分析多个仅在一个选定标记上不同的句子的翻译结果，统计保持翻译不变时替换特定标记的概率，从而计算翻译熵。

Result: 该方法能够量化评估翻译器的翻译熵，显示翻译熵在解码器模块中增强，可用于对MarianMT、T5-Base和NLLB-200等翻译器进行排名，并验证了翻译熵的对称性。

Conclusion: 翻译熵是一个可测量的属性，为人工翻译器提供了客观的基准测试方法，扩展方法还展示了两个标记替换时的乘法效应。

Abstract: The translation of written language has been known since the 3rd century BC; however, its necessity has become increasingly common in the information age. Today, many translators exist, based on encoder-decoder deep architectures, nevertheless, no quantitative objective methods are available to assess their performance, likely because the entropy of even a single language remains unknown. This study presents a quantitative method for estimating translation entropy, with the following key finding. Given a translator, several sentences that differ by only one selected token of a given pivot sentence yield identical translations. Analyzing the statistics of this phenomenon across an ensemble of such sentences, consisting each of a pivot selected token, yields the probabilities of replacing this specific token with others while preserving the translation. These probabilities constitute the entropy of the selected token, and the average across all selected pivot tokens provides an estimate of the translator's overall translation entropy, which is enhanced along the decoder blocks. This entropic measure allows for the quantitative ranking of several publicly available translators and reveals whether mutual translation entropy is symmetric. Extending the proposed method to include the replacement of two tokens in a given pivot sentence demonstrates a multiplicative effect, where translation degeneracy is proportional to the product of the degeneracies of the two tokens. These findings establish translation entropy as a measurable property and objective benchmarking of artificial translators. Results are based on MarianMT, T5-Base and NLLB-200 translators.

Abstract: Automatic diacritic restoration is crucial for text processing in languages with rich diacritical marks, such as Romanian. This study evaluates the performance of several large language models (LLMs) in restoring diacritics in Romanian texts. Using a comprehensive corpus, we tested models including OpenAI's GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, Google's Gemini 1.0 Pro, Meta's Llama 2 and Llama 3, MistralAI's Mixtral 8x7B Instruct, airoboros 70B, and OpenLLM-Ro's RoLlama 2 7B, under multiple prompt templates ranging from zero-shot to complex multi-shot instructions. Results show that models such as GPT-4o achieve high diacritic restoration accuracy, consistently surpassing a neutral echo baseline, while others, including Meta's Llama family, exhibit wider variability. These findings highlight the impact of model architecture, training data, and prompt design on diacritic restoration performance and outline promising directions for improving NLP tools for diacritic-rich languages.

*Tyler Loakman,Joseph James,Chenghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了视觉语言模型在语音识别任务中的表现，发现它们难以正确解读语音的频谱图和波形图，即使在微调后性能也接近随机猜测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型和视觉语言模型的发展，研究者希望了解这些模型在融合视觉和语言模态任务中的能力，特别是能否像专业语音学家一样解读语音的视觉表示。

Method: 创建了包含4000+英语单词的合成数据集，包含单词的频谱图和波形图。通过多项选择任务测试模型从3个干扰转录中识别正确音素或字素转录的能力。

Result: 无论是零样本还是微调后的模型，其性能都很少超过随机猜测水平，表明模型缺乏解读这类语音视觉表示所需的特定参数知识。

Conclusion: 仅靠配对样本不足以让视觉语言模型学会正确解读语音的频谱图和波形图，需要专门的参数知识来理解这类视觉表示。

Abstract: With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their vision-enabled counterparts (VLMs), numerous works have investigated their capabilities in tasks that fuse the modalities of vision and language. In this work, we benchmark the extent to which VLMs are able to act as highly-trained phoneticians, interpreting spectrograms and waveforms of speech. To do this, we synthesise a novel dataset containing 4k+ English words spoken in isolation alongside stylistically consistent spectrogram and waveform figures. We test the ability of VLMs to understand these representations of speech through a multiple-choice task whereby models must predict the correct phonemic or graphemic transcription of a spoken word when presented amongst 3 distractor transcriptions that have been selected based on their phonemic edit distance to the ground truth. We observe that both zero-shot and finetuned models rarely perform above chance, demonstrating the requirement for specific parametric knowledge of how to interpret such figures, rather than paired samples alone.

TL;DR: SoCE是一种模型融合方法，通过识别不同类别任务的专家模型并使用非均匀加权平均来提升性能，避免了昂贵的重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM训练资源密集且耗时，模型融合作为替代方案可以提升性能而无需重新训练。传统均匀平均方法未充分利用不同任务间的性能差异。

Method: 利用基准测试组合识别最优模型候选，通过非均匀加权平均结合各弱相关类别簇的专家模型，而非使用均匀权重。

Result: 在多个领域（多语言能力、工具调用、数学）提升了性能和鲁棒性，在Berkeley函数调用排行榜上达到最先进结果。

Conclusion: SoCE提供了一种原则性的模型融合方法，通过利用任务间低相关性特点，实现了比均匀平均更好的性能提升。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, but their training remains resource- and time-intensive, requiring massive compute power and careful orchestration of training procedures. Model souping-the practice of averaging weights from multiple models of the same architecture-has emerged as a promising pre- and post-training technique that can enhance performance without expensive retraining. In this paper, we introduce Soup Of Category Experts (SoCE), a principled approach for model souping that utilizes benchmark composition to identify optimal model candidates and applies non-uniform weighted averaging to maximize performance. Contrary to previous uniform-averaging approaches, our method leverages the observation that benchmark categories often exhibit low inter-correlations in model performance. SoCE identifies "expert" models for each weakly-correlated category cluster and combines them using optimized weighted averaging rather than uniform weights. We demonstrate that the proposed method improves performance and robustness across multiple domains, including multilingual capabilities, tool calling, and math and achieves state-of-the-art results on the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard.

TL;DR: RegionMarker是一种区域触发语义水印框架，通过在低维空间中定义触发区域并向相关文本嵌入注入水印，为Embedding-as-a-Service提供全面的版权保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EaaS水印方法只能抵抗部分攻击，无法提供全面保护，导致模型提取攻击可能造成重大经济损失。

Method: 使用秘密降维矩阵投影到子空间，随机选择触发区域，将水印嵌入整个触发区域，并使用文本嵌入作为水印。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，RegionMarker能有效抵抗不同攻击方法，保护EaaS版权。

Conclusion: RegionMarker通过区域触发语义水印框架，为EaaS提供了全面的版权保护解决方案。

Abstract: Embedding-as-a-Service (EaaS) is an effective and convenient deployment solution for addressing various NLP tasks. Nevertheless, recent research has shown that EaaS is vulnerable to model extraction attacks, which could lead to significant economic losses for model providers. For copyright protection, existing methods inject watermark embeddings into text embeddings and use them to detect copyright infringement. However, current watermarking methods often resist only a subset of attacks and fail to provide \textit{comprehensive} protection. To this end, we present the region-triggered semantic watermarking framework called RegionMarker, which defines trigger regions within a low-dimensional space and injects watermarks into text embeddings associated with these regions. By utilizing a secret dimensionality reduction matrix to project onto this subspace and randomly selecting trigger regions, RegionMarker makes it difficult for watermark removal attacks to evade detection. Furthermore, by embedding watermarks across the entire trigger region and using the text embedding as the watermark, RegionMarker is resilient to both paraphrasing and dimension-perturbation attacks. Extensive experiments on various datasets show that RegionMarker is effective in resisting different attack methods, thereby protecting the copyright of EaaS.

TL;DR: 本文通过控制性PEFT/LoRA研究，揭示了多语言大语言模型在任务和语言间的迁移模式：同任务跨语言迁移通常为正，而异任务迁移常导致性能下降，并发现了稳定的捐赠者-接收者结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大语言模型在一个任务或语言上的改进如何影响其他任务和语言及其组合，目前仍缺乏系统研究。

Method: 在多个开源LLM家族和规模上进行控制性PEFT/LoRA研究，将任务和语言作为迁移轴，在单一任务-语言源上进行微调，并测量在所有其他任务-语言目标对上的迁移效果。

Result: 发现两个一致模式：1) 同任务跨语言迁移可靠为正，而异任务迁移常导致性能下降；2) 跨语言和任务存在稳定的捐赠者-接收者结构。

Conclusion: 这些发现对风险感知的微调和模型专业化具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) perform strongly across tasks and languages, yet how improvements in one task or language affect other tasks and languages and their combinations remains poorly understood. We conduct a controlled PEFT/LoRA study across multiple open-weight LLM families and sizes, treating task and language as transfer axes while conditioning on model family and size; we fine-tune each model on a single task-language source and measure transfer as the percentage-point change versus its baseline score when evaluated on all other task-language target pairs. We decompose transfer into (i) Matched-Task (Cross-Language), (ii) Matched-Language (Cross-Task), and (iii) Cross-Task (Cross-Language) regimes. We uncover two consistent general patterns. First, a pronounced on-task vs. off-task asymmetry: Matched-Task (Cross-Language) transfer is reliably positive, whereas off-task transfer often incurs collateral degradation. Second, a stable donor-recipient structure across languages and tasks (hub donors vs. brittle recipients). We outline implications for risk-aware fine-tuning and model specialisation.

TL;DR: PEDIASBench评估框架显示，当前大语言模型在儿科医学中基础知识表现良好，但在复杂推理、动态诊疗和人文关怀方面存在局限，尚不能独立承担儿科诊疗工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在医学领域的快速发展，需要评估它们是否能在真实临床环境中胜任儿科医生的工作。

Method: 开发了PEDIASBench系统评估框架，从基础知识应用、动态诊疗能力、儿科医疗安全与伦理三个维度，评估12个代表性模型在19个儿科亚专科和211种典型疾病上的表现。

Result: 最先进模型在基础知识上表现良好（Qwen3-235B-A22B在执照级问题上准确率超90%），但随着任务复杂度增加性能下降约15%；在动态诊疗场景中，DeepSeek-R1在病例推理中得分最高（平均0.58），但大多数模型难以适应实时患者变化；在儿科伦理安全任务中，Qwen2.5-72B表现最佳（准确率92.05%），但人文敏感性仍有限。

Conclusion: 当前儿科大语言模型受限于有限的动态决策能力和未充分发展的人文关怀，未来应关注多模态整合和临床反馈-模型迭代循环，以增强安全性、可解释性和人机协作。虽然不能独立承担儿科诊疗，但在决策支持、医学教育和患者沟通方面具有潜力。

Abstract: With the rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) in medicine, a key question is whether they can function as competent pediatricians in real-world clinical settings. We developed PEDIASBench, a systematic evaluation framework centered on a knowledge-system framework and tailored to realistic clinical environments. PEDIASBench assesses LLMs across three dimensions: application of basic knowledge, dynamic diagnosis and treatment capability, and pediatric medical safety and medical ethics. We evaluated 12 representative models released over the past two years, including GPT-4o, Qwen3-235B-A22B, and DeepSeek-V3, covering 19 pediatric subspecialties and 211 prototypical diseases. State-of-the-art models performed well on foundational knowledge, with Qwen3-235B-A22B achieving over 90% accuracy on licensing-level questions, but performance declined ~15% as task complexity increased, revealing limitations in complex reasoning. Multiple-choice assessments highlighted weaknesses in integrative reasoning and knowledge recall. In dynamic diagnosis and treatment scenarios, DeepSeek-R1 scored highest in case reasoning (mean 0.58), yet most models struggled to adapt to real-time patient changes. On pediatric medical ethics and safety tasks, Qwen2.5-72B performed best (accuracy 92.05%), though humanistic sensitivity remained limited. These findings indicate that pediatric LLMs are constrained by limited dynamic decision-making and underdeveloped humanistic care. Future development should focus on multimodal integration and a clinical feedback-model iteration loop to enhance safety, interpretability, and human-AI collaboration. While current LLMs cannot independently perform pediatric care, they hold promise for decision support, medical education, and patient communication, laying the groundwork for a safe, trustworthy, and collaborative intelligent pediatric healthcare system.

Motivation: 随着智能个人设备的普及，需要能够理解用户特定特征的个性化对话助手，但现有方法往往忽略长期交互的复杂性。

Method: 开发了多步骤LLM合成流程创建PAL-Set数据集，并提出H²Memory分层异构记忆框架，结合检索增强生成技术。

Result: 在PAL-Bench和外部数据集上的综合实验证明了所提记忆框架的有效性。

Conclusion: PAL-Bench为评估服务导向助手的个性化能力提供了新基准，H²Memory框架显著改善了长期用户-代理交互中的个性化响应生成。

Abstract: With the rise of smart personal devices, service-oriented human-agent interactions have become increasingly prevalent. This trend highlights the need for personalized dialogue assistants that can understand user-specific traits to accurately interpret requirements and tailor responses to individual preferences. However, existing approaches often overlook the complexities of long-term interactions and fail to capture users' subjective characteristics. To address these gaps, we present PAL-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the personalization capabilities of service-oriented assistants in long-term user-agent interactions. In the absence of available real-world data, we develop a multi-step LLM-based synthesis pipeline, which is further verified and refined by human annotators. This process yields PAL-Set, the first Chinese dataset comprising multi-session user logs and dialogue histories, which serves as the foundation for PAL-Bench. Furthermore, to improve personalized service-oriented interactions, we propose H$^2$Memory, a hierarchical and heterogeneous memory framework that incorporates retrieval-augmented generation to improve personalized response generation. Comprehensive experiments on both our PAL-Bench and an external dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed memory framework.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于对数函数的非线性翻译质量评估模型，解决了传统线性评分对短文本过度惩罚、对长文本惩罚不足的问题，使评估结果更符合人类感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于MQM的线性评分方法在不同长度文本评估中存在偏差，短文本被过度惩罚而长文本被惩罚不足，与专家直觉不一致。

Method: 构建两参数对数模型E(x) = a * ln(1 + b * x)，基于韦伯-费希纳定律和认知负荷理论，通过一维根查找步骤从两个容忍点进行校准。

Result: 实证数据显示可接受错误数量随样本大小呈对数增长而非线性增长，新模型提高了跨长度文本评估的公平性和评分者间信度。

Conclusion: 该非线性模型为翻译质量评估提供了更准确、可扩展的感知有效评分范式，为AI驱动的文档级评估提供了更强基础。

Abstract: Analytic Translation Quality Evaluation (TQE), based on Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM), traditionally uses a linear error-to-penalty scale calibrated to a reference sample of 1000-2000 words. However, linear extrapolation biases judgment on samples of different sizes, over-penalizing short samples and under-penalizing long ones, producing misalignment with expert intuition.
  Building on the Multi-Range framework, this paper presents a calibrated, non-linear scoring model that better reflects how human content consumers perceive translation quality across samples of varying length. Empirical data from three large-scale enterprise environments shows that acceptable error counts grow logarithmically, not linearly, with sample size.
  Psychophysical and cognitive evidence, including the Weber-Fechner law and Cognitive Load Theory, supports this premise by explaining why the perceptual impact of additional errors diminishes while the cognitive burden grows with scale. We propose a two-parameter model
  E(x) = a * ln(1 + b * x), a, b > 0,
  anchored to a reference tolerance and calibrated from two tolerance points using a one-dimensional root-finding step. The model yields an explicit interval within which the linear approximation stays within +/-20 percent relative error and integrates into existing evaluation workflows with only a dynamic tolerance function added.
  The approach improves interpretability, fairness, and inter-rater reliability across both human and AI-generated translations. By operationalizing a perceptually valid scoring paradigm, it advances translation quality evaluation toward more accurate and scalable assessment. The model also provides a stronger basis for AI-based document-level evaluation aligned with human judgment. Implementation considerations for CAT/LQA systems and implications for human and AI-generated text evaluation are discussed.

Result: 在情感分类任务中表现出色，事件研究表明市场反应受到报告中特定方面的选择性影响。

Conclusion: 研究强调了财务文本情感分析的复杂性，并指出解决模糊语言对于准确评估市场情绪的重要性。

Abstract: Understanding sentiment in financial documents is crucial for gaining insights into market behavior. These reports often contain obfuscated language designed to present a positive or neutral outlook, even when underlying conditions may be less favorable. This paper presents a novel approach using Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) to decode obfuscated sentiment in Thai financial annual reports. We develop specific guidelines for annotating obfuscated sentiment in these texts and annotate more than one hundred financial reports. We then benchmark various text classification models on this annotated dataset, demonstrating strong performance in sentiment classification. Additionally, we conduct an event study to evaluate the real-world implications of our sentiment analysis on stock prices. Our results suggest that market reactions are selectively influenced by specific aspects within the reports. Our findings underscore the complexity of sentiment analysis in financial texts and highlight the importance of addressing obfuscated language to accurately assess market sentiment.

Abstract: Public Narratives (PNs) are key tools for leadership development and civic mobilization, yet their systematic analysis remains challenging due to their subjective interpretation and the high cost of expert annotation. In this work, we propose a novel computational framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate the qualitative annotation of public narratives. Using a codebook we co-developed with subject-matter experts, we evaluate LLM performance against that of expert annotators. Our work reveals that LLMs can achieve near-human-expert performance, achieving an average F1 score of 0.80 across 8 narratives and 14 codes. We then extend our analysis to empirically explore how PN framework elements manifest across a larger dataset of 22 stories. Lastly, we extrapolate our analysis to a set of political speeches, establishing a novel lens in which to analyze political rhetoric in civic spaces. This study demonstrates the potential of LLM-assisted annotation for scalable narrative analysis and highlights key limitations and directions for future research in computational civic storytelling.

Motivation: 高资源语言拥有丰富的ASR数据集，而匈牙利语等语言由于缺乏自发和对话语音语料库而代表性不足。

Method: 从匈牙利语语音语料库BEA中构建了两个新数据集：BEA-Large（255小时自发语音）和BEA-Dialogue（85小时自然对话），并使用公开可用的ASR模型建立基线。

Result: 微调的Fast Conformer模型在自发语音上词错误率为14.18%，在重复语音上为4.8%；说话人日志错误率在13.05%-18.26%之间。

Conclusion: 对话ASR仍然具有挑战性，特别是由于不流利、重叠和非正式语音模式。这些数据集和基线将推动匈牙利语语音技术发展，并为其他语言提供方法论框架。

Abstract: The advancement of automatic speech recognition (ASR) has been largely enhanced by extensive datasets in high-resource languages, while languages such as Hungarian remain underrepresented due to limited spontaneous and conversational corpora. To address this gap, we introduce two new datasets -- BEA-Large and BEA-Dialogue -- constructed from the previously unprocessed portions of the Hungarian speech corpus named BEA. BEA-Large extends BEA-Base with 255 hours of spontaneous speech from 433 speakers, enriched with detailed segment-level metadata. BEA-Dialogue, comprising 85 hours of spontaneous conversations, is a Hungarian speech corpus featuring natural dialogues partitioned into speaker-independent subsets, supporting research in conversational ASR and speaker diarization. We establish reproducible baselines on these datasets using publicly available ASR models, with the fine-tuned Fast Conformer model achieving word error rates as low as 14.18\% on spontaneous and 4.8\% on repeated speech. Diarization experiments yield diarization error rates between 13.05\% and 18.26\%, providing reference points for future improvements. The results highlight the persistent difficulty of conversational ASR, particularly due to disfluencies, overlaps, and informal speech patterns. By releasing these datasets and baselines, we aim to advance Hungarian speech technology and offer a methodological framework for developing spontaneous and conversational benchmarks in other languages.

Motivation: 现有文本到SQL数据集覆盖范围有限，无法捕捉真实应用的多样性，需要更全面的分类方法和数据集。

Method: 开发了新的文本到SQL分类法，结合大型语言模型构建了分类法指导的数据集合成管道，生成了SQL-Synth数据集。

Conclusion: 提出的分类法具有重要影响，不仅能全面分析数据集和LLM性能，还能指导LLM训练数据的构建。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL datasets are essential for training and evaluating text-to-SQL models, but existing datasets often suffer from limited coverage and fail to capture the diversity of real-world applications. To address this, we propose a novel taxonomy for text-to-SQL classification based on dimensions including core intents, statement types, syntax structures, and key actions. Using this taxonomy, we evaluate widely used public text-to-SQL datasets (e.g., Spider and Bird) and reveal limitations in their coverage and diversity. We then introduce a taxonomy-guided dataset synthesis pipeline, yielding a new dataset named SQL-Synth. This approach combines the taxonomy with Large Language Models (LLMs) to ensure the dataset reflects the breadth and complexity of real-world text-to-SQL applications. Extensive analysis and experimental results validate the effectiveness of our taxonomy, as SQL-Synth exhibits greater diversity and coverage compared to existing benchmarks. Moreover, we uncover that existing LLMs typically fall short in adequately capturing the full range of scenarios, resulting in limited performance on SQL-Synth. However, fine-tuning can substantially improve their performance in these scenarios. The proposed taxonomy has significant potential impact, as it not only enables comprehensive analysis of datasets and the performance of different LLMs, but also guides the construction of training data for LLMs.

Conclusion: 为开发高效且类人的个性化AI助手开辟了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLM-powered agents have demonstrated significant potential in generating human-like responses; however, they continue to face challenges in maintaining long-term interactions within complex environments, primarily due to limitations in contextual consistency and dynamic personalization. Existing memory systems often depend on semantic grouping prior to retrieval, which can overlook semantically irrelevant yet critical user information and introduce retrieval noise. In this report, we propose the initial design of O-Mem, a novel memory framework based on active user profiling that dynamically extracts and updates user characteristics and event records from their proactive interactions with agents. O-Mem supports hierarchical retrieval of persona attributes and topic-related context, enabling more adaptive and coherent personalized responses. O-Mem achieves 51.76% on the public LoCoMo benchmark, a nearly 3% improvement upon LangMem,the previous state-of-the-art, and it achieves 62.99% on PERSONAMEM, a 3.5% improvement upon A-Mem,the previous state-of-the-art. O-Mem also boosts token and interaction response time efficiency compared to previous memory frameworks. Our work opens up promising directions for developing efficient and human-like personalized AI assistants in the future.

Method: 利用大型语言模型将机器学习学到的词汇线索转化为人类可理解的语言现象，这些现象基于数据实证，具有跨领域泛化能力。

Result: 通过这种方法获得的语言现象比LLMs先验知识或上下文学习获得的现象更具预测性，且能帮助人们在缺乏检测分类器的环境中评估评论可信度。

Conclusion: 使用LLMs翻译机器学习特征为人类可理解的语言现象是一种有效方法，这些现象具有实证基础、跨领域泛化能力，并能辅助人们进行欺骗性评论识别。

Abstract: Deceptive reviews mislead consumers, harm businesses, and undermine trust in online marketplaces. Machine learning classifiers can learn from large amounts of training examples to effectively distinguish deceptive reviews from genuine ones. However, the distinguishing features learned by these classifiers are often subtle, fragmented, and difficult for humans to interpret. In this work, we explore using large language models (LLMs) to translate machine-learned lexical cues into human-understandable language phenomena that can differentiate deceptive reviews from genuine ones. We show that language phenomena obtained in this manner are empirically grounded in data, generalizable across similar domains, and more predictive than phenomena either in LLMs' prior knowledge or obtained through in-context learning. These language phenomena have the potential to aid people in critically assessing the credibility of online reviews in environments where deception detection classifiers are unavailable.

### [381] [HAPO: Training Language Models to Reason Concisely via History-Aware Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11225)
*Chengyu Huang,Zhengxin Zhang,Claire Cardie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HAPO是一种历史感知策略优化方法，通过跟踪每个问题的历史状态来激励模型发现比先前更简洁的正确解决方案，在保持准确性的同时显著减少响应长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在测试时扩展响应长度虽然能提升LLM的推理能力，但会导致冗长输出和增加推理成本。传统方法未能利用训练中同一问题的历史信息，限制了解决方案随时间推移变得简洁的能力。

Method: HAPO为每个问题维护历史状态（如先前正确响应的最小长度），基于历史状态设计新颖的长度奖励函数，激励发现比先前更简洁的正确解决方案，同时避免过度惩罚较短的错误响应以促进探索。

Result: 在多个数学基准测试中，HAPO实现了33-59%的长度缩减，准确率仅下降2-5%，有效诱导LLM的简洁推理能力。

Conclusion: HAPO通过结合历史信息和奖励机制，成功地在保持正确性的同时显著提高了LLM的推理效率，为高效推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: While scaling the length of responses at test-time has been shown to markedly improve the reasoning abilities and performance of large language models (LLMs), it often results in verbose outputs and increases inference cost. Prior approaches for efficient test-time scaling, typically using universal budget constraints or query-level length optimization, do not leverage historical information from previous encounters with the same problem during training. We hypothesize that this limits their ability to progressively make solutions more concise over time. To address this, we present History-Aware Policy Optimization (HAPO), which keeps track of a history state (e.g., the minimum length over previously generated correct responses) for each problem. HAPO employs a novel length reward function based on this history state to incentivize the discovery of correct solutions that are more concise than those previously found. Crucially, this reward structure avoids overly penalizing shorter incorrect responses with the goal of facilitating exploration towards more efficient solutions. By combining this length reward with a correctness reward, HAPO jointly optimizes for correctness and efficiency. We use HAPO to train DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview, and Qwen-2.5-1.5B-Instruct, and evaluate HAPO on several math benchmarks that span various difficulty levels. Experiment results demonstrate that HAPO effectively induces LLMs' concise reasoning abilities, producing length reductions of 33-59% with accuracy drops of only 2-5%.

TL;DR: 提出了TAI框架，利用大语言模型和潜在扩散模型来翻译和生成印度诗歌的图像表示，以增强印度语言诗歌的全球可访问性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度诗歌具有丰富的文化遗产，但由于其语言复杂性和文化内涵，非母语读者难以理解。现有研究忽视了印度语言诗歌，需要解决翻译和视觉理解方面的差距。

Method: TAI框架包括：(1) 使用几率比偏好对齐算法的翻译模块，准确翻译形态丰富的诗歌；(2) 使用语义图捕捉隐喻和含义关系的图像生成模块，创建诗歌的视觉表示。

Result: 综合实验评估显示，TAI Diffusion在诗歌图像生成任务中优于强基线模型。同时构建了包含1,570首诗歌的MorphoVerse数据集，涵盖21种低资源印度语言。

Conclusion: 该工作通过解决诗歌翻译和视觉理解的空白，旨在扩大印度诗歌的可访问性并丰富读者体验，支持联合国可持续发展目标中的优质教育和减少不平等。

Abstract: Indian poetry, known for its linguistic complexity and deep cultural resonance, has a rich and varied heritage spanning thousands of years. However, its layered meanings, cultural allusions, and sophisticated grammatical constructions often pose challenges for comprehension, especially for non-native speakers or readers unfamiliar with its context and language. Despite its cultural significance, existing works on poetry have largely overlooked Indian language poems. In this paper, we propose the Translation and Image Generation (TAI) framework, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Latent Diffusion Models through appropriate prompt tuning. Our framework supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals of Quality Education (SDG 4) and Reduced Inequalities (SDG 10) by enhancing the accessibility of culturally rich Indian-language poetry to a global audience. It includes (1) a translation module that uses an Odds Ratio Preference Alignment Algorithm to accurately translate morphologically rich poetry into English, and (2) an image generation module that employs a semantic graph to capture tokens, dependencies, and semantic relationships between metaphors and their meanings, to create visually meaningful representations of Indian poems. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation, including both human and quantitative assessments, demonstrates the superiority of TAI Diffusion in poem image generation tasks, outperforming strong baselines. To further address the scarcity of resources for Indian-language poetry, we introduce the Morphologically Rich Indian Language Poems MorphoVerse Dataset, comprising 1,570 poems across 21 low-resource Indian languages. By addressing the gap in poetry translation and visual comprehension, this work aims to broaden accessibility and enrich the reader's experience.

TL;DR: 本文提出了DCRM指标来衡量偏好优化中响应对的质量，并通过最佳配对方法提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究试图将偏好优化性能与底层偏好数据集关联，但作者发现偏好的响应与不偏好的响应之间的差异可能不符合期望的学习差异。

Method: 使用距离和奖励边际量化响应差异，结合得到DCRM指标，并提出最佳配对方法选择DCRM最高的响应对。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在各种设置下都能在AlpacaEval、MT-Bench和Arena-Hard等基准上超越现有训练集的性能。

Conclusion: DCRM与学习结果存在普遍相关性，基于DCRM的配对方法能有效提升偏好优化性能。

Abstract: Recent research has attempted to associate preference optimization (PO) performance with the underlying preference datasets. In this work, our observation is that the differences between the preferred response $y^+$ and dispreferred response $y^-$ influence what LLMs can learn, which may not match the desirable differences to learn. Therefore, we use distance and reward margin to quantify these differences, and combine them to get Distance Calibrated Reward Margin (DCRM), a metric that measures the quality of a response pair for PO. Intuitively, DCRM encourages minimal noisy differences and maximal desired differences. With this, we study 3 types of commonly used preference datasets, classified along two axes: the source of the responses and the preference labeling function. We establish a general correlation between higher DCRM of the training set and better learning outcome. Inspired by this, we propose a best-of-$N^2$ pairing method that selects response pairs with the highest DCRM. Empirically, in various settings, our method produces training datasets that can further improve models' performance on AlpacaEval, MT-Bench, and Arena-Hard over the existing training sets.

TL;DR: Lang1模型家族通过结合医疗电子病历和互联网数据进行预训练，在医疗操作决策任务上显著优于通用模型，特别是在微调后表现更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用基础模型缺乏医疗操作决策所需的专业知识，需要开发专门针对医疗领域的语言模型。

Method: 开发Lang1模型家族，使用80B临床电子病历token和627B互联网token进行预训练，并在ReMedE基准上进行微调和评估。

Result: Lang1-1B在微调后优于比其大70倍的通用模型，AUROC提升3.64%-6.75%，在跨任务和外部系统上表现出良好的迁移能力。

Conclusion: 有效的医疗系统AI需要领域内预训练、监督微调和真实世界评估的结合，专业LLM在专业任务上可与通用模型竞争。

Abstract: Hospitals and healthcare systems rely on operational decisions that determine patient flow, cost, and quality of care. Despite strong performance on medical knowledge and conversational benchmarks, foundation models trained on general text may lack the specialized knowledge required for these operational decisions. We introduce Lang1, a family of models (100M-7B parameters) pretrained on a specialized corpus blending 80B clinical tokens from NYU Langone Health's EHRs and 627B tokens from the internet. To rigorously evaluate Lang1 in real-world settings, we developed the REalistic Medical Evaluation (ReMedE), a benchmark derived from 668,331 EHR notes that evaluates five critical tasks: 30-day readmission prediction, 30-day mortality prediction, length of stay, comorbidity coding, and predicting insurance claims denial. In zero-shot settings, both general-purpose and specialized models underperform on four of five tasks (36.6%-71.7% AUROC), with mortality prediction being an exception. After finetuning, Lang1-1B outperforms finetuned generalist models up to 70x larger and zero-shot models up to 671x larger, improving AUROC by 3.64%-6.75% and 1.66%-23.66% respectively. We also observed cross-task scaling with joint finetuning on multiple tasks leading to improvement on other tasks. Lang1-1B effectively transfers to out-of-distribution settings, including other clinical tasks and an external health system. Our findings suggest that predictive capabilities for hospital operations require explicit supervised finetuning, and that this finetuning process is made more efficient by in-domain pretraining on EHR. Our findings support the emerging view that specialized LLMs can compete with generalist models in specialized tasks, and show that effective healthcare systems AI requires the combination of in-domain pretraining, supervised finetuning, and real-world evaluation beyond proxy benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决自然语言处理任务中数据获取困难和真实数据隐私问题，探索LLM生成数据集在情感分析中的潜力。

Method: 使用定制提示创建负面新闻标题语料库，通过专家验证和嵌入空间分析，采用比较困惑度测试、可读性测试、词性标注分析、BERTScore和语义相似度等多种评估方法。

Result: 生成的标题与真实标题高度匹配，仅在词性标注分析中的专有名词得分存在明显差异。

Conclusion: LLM生成的合成数据集可以作为真实世界数据的有效替代方案，在负面情感分析任务中表现出良好的适用性。

Abstract: This research examines the potential of datasets generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) to support Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, aiming to overcome challenges related to data acquisition and privacy concerns associated with real-world data. Focusing on negative valence text, a critical component of sentiment analysis, we explore the use of LLM-generated synthetic news headlines as an alternative to real-world data. A specialized corpus of negative news headlines was created using tailored prompts to capture diverse negative sentiments across various societal domains. The synthetic headlines were validated by expert review and further analyzed in embedding space to assess their alignment with real-world negative news in terms of content, tone, length, and style. Key metrics such as correlation with real headlines, perplexity, coherence, and realism were evaluated. The synthetic dataset was benchmarked against two sets of real news headlines using evaluations including the Comparative Perplexity Test, Comparative Readability Test, Comparative POS Profiling, BERTScore, and Comparative Semantic Similarity. Results show the generated headlines match real headlines with the only marked divergence being in the proper noun score of the POS profile test.

Motivation: 评估大语言模型处理复杂专业知识的真实能力，特别是在气候变化这一关键领域，需要基于真实用户问题和科学评估标准的可靠基准

Method: 开发CLINB基准，包含真实用户问题、多模态问答任务和气候科学家制定的评估标准，采用基于模型的评估流程测试多个前沿模型

Result: 前沿模型展现出卓越的知识合成能力（博士级理解），优于专家辅助的混合答案，但在证据基础方面存在严重问题，引用和图像幻觉率很高

Conclusion: 知识合成与可验证归因之间的差距是AI在科学工作流中部署的关键障碍，需要像CLINB这样的可靠基准来构建可信AI系统

Abstract: Evaluating how Large Language Models (LLMs) handle complex, specialized knowledge remains a critical challenge. We address this through the lens of climate change by introducing CLINB, a benchmark that assesses models on open-ended, grounded, multimodal question answering tasks with clear requirements for knowledge quality and evidential support. CLINB relies on a dataset of real users' questions and evaluation rubrics curated by leading climate scientists. We implement and validate a model-based evaluation process and evaluate several frontier models. Our findings reveal a critical dichotomy. Frontier models demonstrate remarkable knowledge synthesis capabilities, often exhibiting PhD-level understanding and presentation quality. They outperform "hybrid" answers curated by domain experts assisted by weaker models. However, this performance is countered by failures in grounding. The quality of evidence varies, with substantial hallucination rates for references and images. We argue that bridging this gap between knowledge synthesis and verifiable attribution is essential for the deployment of AI in scientific workflows and that reliable, interpretable benchmarks like CLINB are needed to progress towards building trustworthy AI systems.

SynBullying provides a scalable and ethically safe alternative to human data collection by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to simulate realistic bullying interactions. The dataset offers (i) conversational structure, capturing multi-turn exchanges rather than isolated posts; (ii) context-aware annotations, where harmfulness is assessed within the conversational flow considering context, intent, and discourse dynamics; and (iii) fine-grained labeling, covering various CB categories for detailed linguistic and behavioral analysis. We evaluate SynBullying across five dimensions, including conversational structure, lexical patterns, sentiment/toxicity, role dynamics, harm intensity, and CB-type distribution. We further examine its utility by testing its performance as standalone training data and as an augmentation source for CB classification.

*Piyushkumar Patel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CausalGuard是一个结合因果推理和符号逻辑的新方法，能够实时检测和预防大语言模型的幻觉问题，在12个基准测试中实现了89.3%的幻觉识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型存在严重幻觉问题，会自信地陈述看似合理但虚假的信息，这成为在准确性要求高的场景中使用这些模型的主要障碍。现有解决方案要么需要重新训练整个模型，要么增加显著计算成本，或者未能解决幻觉的根本原因。

Method: CausalGuard通过两条互补路径工作：一条路径追踪模型已知信息与生成内容之间的因果关系，另一条使用自动推理检查逻辑一致性。该方法在生成过程中早期干预，理解导致虚假陈述的因果链。

Result: 在12个不同基准测试中，CausalGuard正确识别幻觉的准确率达到89.3%，漏报率仅为8.3%。更重要的是，它将虚假声明减少了近80%，同时保持回答的自然性和帮助性。在需要多步逻辑推理的复杂任务中表现尤其出色。

Conclusion: CausalGuard通过展示其推理过程，在医疗诊断或金融分析等敏感领域特别有效，因为这些领域理解决策原因与决策本身同样重要。该方法为解决大语言模型幻觉问题提供了一种有效的新途径。

Abstract: While large language models have transformed how we interact with AI systems, they have a critical weakness: they confidently state false information that sounds entirely plausible. This "hallucination" problem has become a major barrier to using these models where accuracy matters most. Existing solutions either require retraining the entire model, add significant computational costs, or miss the root causes of why these hallucinations occur in the first place.
  We present CausalGuard, a new approach that combines causal reasoning with symbolic logic to catch and prevent hallucinations as they happen. Unlike previous methods that only check outputs after generation, our system understands the causal chain that leads to false statements and intervenes early in the process. CausalGuard works through two complementary paths: one that traces causal relationships between what the model knows and what it generates, and another that checks logical consistency using automated reasoning.
  Testing across twelve different benchmarks, we found that CausalGuard correctly identifies hallucinations 89.3\% of the time while missing only 8.3\% of actual hallucinations. More importantly, it reduces false claims by nearly 80\% while keeping responses natural and helpful. The system performs especially well on complex reasoning tasks where multiple steps of logic are required. Because CausalGuard shows its reasoning process, it works well in sensitive areas like medical diagnosis or financial analysis where understanding why a decision was made matters as much as the decision itself.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要建立一个系统性的方法来量化游戏中技能和运气的相对贡献，以便更好地理解游戏机制、评估玩家表现和指导游戏设计。

Method: 将游戏建模为随机决策树，分解游戏结果为技能杠杆K和运气杠杆L，定义技能-运气指数S(G) = (K-L)/(K+L)，并引入波动率Sigma来量化连续回合的结果不确定性。

Result: 分析30种游戏显示从纯运气（硬币投掷，S=-1）到纯技能（国际象棋，S=+1）的连续谱，扑克显示中等技能主导（S=0.33），西洋双陆棋处于平衡状态（S=0）。

Conclusion: 该框架可扩展到一般随机决策系统，为玩家影响力评估、游戏平衡分析和预测稳定性提供了原则性比较方法，在游戏设计、AI评估和风险评估中有广泛应用。

Abstract: We introduce a quantitative framework for separating skill and chance in games by modeling them as complementary sources of control over stochastic decision trees. We define the Skill-Luck Index S(G) in [-1, 1] by decomposing game outcomes into skill leverage K and luck leverage L. Applying this to 30 games reveals a continuum from pure chance (coin toss, S = -1) through mixed domains such as backgammon (S = 0, Sigma = 1.20) to pure skill (chess, S = +1, Sigma = 0). Poker exhibits moderate skill dominance (S = 0.33) with K = 0.40 +/- 0.03 and Sigma = 0.80. We further introduce volatility Sigma to quantify outcome uncertainty over successive turns. The framework extends to general stochastic decision systems, enabling principled comparisons of player influence, game balance, and predictive stability, with applications to game design, AI evaluation, and risk assessment.

Conclusion: VALOR为在开放世界环境中部署安全、对齐且有用的图像生成系统提供了一种可扩展且有效的方法。

Abstract: Generative vision-language models like Stable Diffusion demonstrate remarkable capabilities in creative media synthesis, but they also pose substantial risks of producing unsafe, offensive, or culturally inappropriate content when prompted adversarially. Current defenses struggle to align outputs with human values without sacrificing generation quality or incurring high costs. To address these challenges, we introduce VALOR (Value-Aligned LLM-Overseen Rewriter), a modular, zero-shot agentic framework for safer and more helpful text-to-image generation. VALOR integrates layered prompt analysis with human-aligned value reasoning: a multi-level NSFW detector filters lexical and semantic risks; a cultural value alignment module identifies violations of social norms, legality, and representational ethics; and an intention disambiguator detects subtle or indirect unsafe implications. When unsafe content is detected, prompts are selectively rewritten by a large language model under dynamic, role-specific instructions designed to preserve user intent while enforcing alignment. If the generated image still fails a safety check, VALOR optionally performs a stylistic regeneration to steer the output toward a safer visual domain without altering core semantics. Experiments across adversarial, ambiguous, and value-sensitive prompts show that VALOR significantly reduces unsafe outputs by up to 100.00% while preserving prompt usefulness and creativity. These results highlight VALOR as a scalable and effective approach for deploying safe, aligned, and helpful image generation systems in open-world settings.

Conclusion: AI-Mandel展示了能够生成和实现具体可行想法的AI物理学家原型，不仅加速科学研究，还揭示了实现人类水平人工智能科学家所面临的具体挑战。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is used in numerous fields of science, yet the initial research questions and targets are still almost always provided by human researchers. AI-generated creative ideas in science are rare and often vague, so that it remains a human task to execute them. Automating idea generation and implementation in one coherent system would significantly shift the role of humans in the scientific process. Here we present AI-Mandel, an LLM agent that can generate and implement ideas in quantum physics. AI-Mandel formulates ideas from the literature and uses a domain-specific AI tool to turn them into concrete experiment designs that can readily be implemented in laboratories. The generated ideas by AI-Mandel are often scientifically interesting - for two of them we have already written independent scientific follow-up papers. The ideas include new variations of quantum teleportation, primitives of quantum networks in indefinite causal orders, and new concepts of geometric phases based on closed loops of quantum information transfer. AI-Mandel is a prototypical demonstration of an AI physicist that can generate and implement concrete, actionable ideas. Building such a system is not only useful to accelerate science, but it also reveals concrete open challenges on the path to human-level artificial scientists.

Motivation: 当前方法缺乏基于实时执行反馈动态调试查询的自适应策略，大型语言模型的一次性生成方式在处理结构化数据时存在脆弱性问题。

Method: 使用仅通过结果驱动的强化学习（GRPO）训练的3B参数模型，学习迭代SPARQL构建的顺序过程策略，无需监督微调。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一个通用蓝图，通过交互教授智能体掌握形式化符号工具，弥合概率性大型语言模型与结构化知识图谱世界之间的差距。

Abstract: Generating complex, logically-sound SPARQL queries for multi-hop questions remains a critical bottleneck for Knowledge Graph Question Answering, as the brittle nature of one-shot generation by Large Language Models (LLMs) hinders reliable interaction with structured data. Current methods lack the adaptive policies needed to dynamically debug queries based on real-time execution feedback. This paper introduces a novel agentic framework where an LLM learns a resilient policy for the sequential process of iterative SPARQL construction. We show that a compact 3B-parameter model, trained exclusively via outcome-driven Reinforcement Learning (GRPO) without supervised fine-tuning, can learn effective policies for this task, discovering how to systematically recover from execution errors and refine its queries toward a correct answer. On a curated, executable single-answer subset of LC-QuAD 2.0, our agent achieves 49.7\% accuracy post-entity-linking, a significant 17.5 percentage point improvement over the strongest iterative zero-shot baseline. Further analysis reveals that while the agent's capability is driven by RL, its performance is enhanced by an explicit deliberative reasoning step that acts as a cognitive scaffold to improve policy precision. This work presents a generalizable blueprint for teaching agents to master formal, symbolic tools through interaction, bridging the gap between probabilistic LLMs and the structured world of Knowledge Graphs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI评估过度依赖抽象智力概念，但智力定义不稳定且无法预测实际任务表现，导致评估与现实效用脱节。

Method: 通过概念和形式分析，检验智力评估的三个假设：通用性、稳定性和现实性，论证只有通用性经得起概念和实证检验。

Result: 分析表明智力不是实现通用性的原因，通用性应被理解为多任务学习问题，直接关联到可测量的性能广度和可靠性。

Conclusion: 应重新构建AI评估框架，以通用性作为更稳定的基础来评估AI在不同任务中的能力，使评估更贴近实际应用需求。

Abstract: Benchmarks such as ARC, Raven-inspired tests, and the Blackbird Task are widely used to evaluate the intelligence of large language models (LLMs). Yet, the concept of intelligence remains elusive- lacking a stable definition and failing to predict performance on practical tasks such as question answering, summarization, or coding. Optimizing for such benchmarks risks misaligning evaluation with real-world utility. Our perspective is that evaluation should be grounded in generality rather than abstract notions of intelligence. We identify three assumptions that often underpin intelligence-focused evaluation: generality, stability, and realism. Through conceptual and formal analysis, we show that only generality withstands conceptual and empirical scrutiny. Intelligence is not what enables generality; generality is best understood as a multitask learning problem that directly links evaluation to measurable performance breadth and reliability. This perspective reframes how progress in AI should be assessed and proposes generality as a more stable foundation for evaluating capability across diverse and evolving tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的评估协议来准确评估LLMs在自然语言到一阶逻辑翻译中的能力，发现对话导向的LLMs具有强大的逻辑理解能力，而嵌入中心模型表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估自然语言到一阶逻辑翻译的数据集和协议存在局限性，可能导致对LLMs实际能力的误判。需要区分真正的语义级逻辑理解与表面模式识别和记忆。

Method: 提出新的评估协议，专门设计用于区分真正的语义级逻辑理解与表面模式识别、记忆和数据集污染。

Result: 使用新评估方法发现，最先进的对话导向LLMs表现出强大的NL-FOL翻译技能和真正的句子级逻辑理解能力，而嵌入中心模型表现明显较差。

Conclusion: 对话导向的LLMs在自然语言到一阶逻辑翻译方面具有强大的能力，但需要专门的评估协议来准确衡量其逻辑理解水平。

Abstract: Due to its expressiveness and unambiguous nature, First-Order Logic (FOL) is a powerful formalism for representing concepts expressed in natural language (NL). This is useful, e.g., for specifying and verifying desired system properties. While translating FOL into human-readable English is relatively straightforward, the inverse problem, converting NL to FOL (NL-FOL translation), has remained a longstanding challenge, for both humans and machines. Although the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) promised a breakthrough, recent literature provides contrasting results on their ability to perform NL-FOL translation. In this work, we provide a threefold contribution. First, we critically examine existing datasets and protocols for evaluating NL-FOL translation performance, revealing key limitations that may cause a misrepresentation of LLMs' actual capabilities. Second, to overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel evaluation protocol explicitly designed to distinguish genuine semantic-level logical understanding from superficial pattern recognition, memorization, and dataset contamination. Third, using this new approach, we show that state-of-the-art, dialogue-oriented LLMs demonstrate strong NL-FOL translation skills and a genuine grasp of sentence-level logic, whereas embedding-centric models perform markedly worse.

### [395] [TopoPerception: A Shortcut-Free Evaluation of Global Visual Perception in Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11831)
*Wenhao Zhou,Hao Zheng,Rong Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TopoPerception是一个基于拓扑属性的基准测试，用于严格评估大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的全局视觉感知能力，发现现有模型在全局感知方面表现不佳，甚至不如随机猜测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估基准虽然视觉语义丰富，但存在不可避免的局部捷径，可能高估模型的感知能力。需要一种无捷径的评估方法来检验LVLMs的全局视觉感知能力。

Method: 利用拓扑属性创建TopoPerception基准，因为拓扑依赖于图像的全局结构且对局部特征不变，从而实现对全局感知的无捷径评估。

Result: 所有最先进模型在最粗感知粒度下表现都不优于随机机会，表明它们严重缺乏全局视觉特征感知能力。更强大的模型反而准确率更低。

Conclusion: 仅扩大模型规模不足以解决全局感知缺陷，可能需要新的训练范式或架构。TopoPerception揭示了当前LVLMs的关键瓶颈并指明了改进方向。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) typically align visual features from an encoder with a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM). However, this makes the visual perception module a bottleneck, which constrains the overall capabilities of LVLMs. Conventional evaluation benchmarks, while rich in visual semantics, often contain unavoidable local shortcuts that can lead to an overestimation of models' perceptual abilities. Here, we introduce TopoPerception, a benchmark that leverages topological properties to rigorously evaluate the global visual perception capabilities of LVLMs across various granularities. Since topology depends on the global structure of an image and is invariant to local features, TopoPerception enables a shortcut-free assessment of global perception, fundamentally distinguishing it from semantically rich tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art models on TopoPerception and find that even at the coarsest perceptual granularity, all models perform no better than random chance, indicating a profound inability to perceive global visual features. Notably, a consistent trend emerge within model families: more powerful models with stronger reasoning capabilities exhibit lower accuracy. This suggests that merely scaling up models is insufficient to address this deficit and may even exacerbate it. Progress may require new training paradigms or architectures. TopoPerception not only exposes a critical bottleneck in current LVLMs but also offers a lens and direction for improving their global visual perception. The data and code are publicly available at: https://github.com/Wenhao-Zhou/TopoPerception.

Motivation: 精细分析术中行为及其对患者结果的影响是一个长期挑战，需要自动化的可解释评估系统。

Method: 利用基于transformer的空间和时间建模以及逐帧分类，在机器人辅助根治性前列腺切除术的神经保留步骤中稳健检测连续短手势。

Result: F2O在手势检测方面表现优异（AUC：帧级0.80；视频级0.81），其衍生特征预测术后结果的准确性与人工标注相当（0.79 vs 0.75），并捕获了与勃起功能恢复相关的关键模式。

Conclusion: F2O通过实现自动可解释评估，为数据驱动的手术反馈和前瞻性临床决策支持建立了基础。

Abstract: Fine-grained analysis of intraoperative behavior and its impact on patient outcomes remain a longstanding challenge. We present Frame-to-Outcome (F2O), an end-to-end system that translates tissue dissection videos into gesture sequences and uncovers patterns associated with postoperative outcomes. Leveraging transformer-based spatial and temporal modeling and frame-wise classification, F2O robustly detects consecutive short (~2 seconds) gestures in the nerve-sparing step of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (AUC: 0.80 frame-level; 0.81 video-level). F2O-derived features (gesture frequency, duration, and transitions) predicted postoperative outcomes with accuracy comparable to human annotations (0.79 vs. 0.75; overlapping 95% CI). Across 25 shared features, effect size directions were concordant with small differences (~ 0.07), and strong correlation (r = 0.96, p < 1e-14). F2O also captured key patterns linked to erectile function recovery, including prolonged tissue peeling and reduced energy use. By enabling automatic interpretable assessment, F2O establishes a foundation for data-driven surgical feedback and prospective clinical decision support.

Motivation: 随着AI模型在不断扩大数据集上训练，需要从训练模型中移除特定数据的影响以实现隐私保护和法规合规。遗忘技术通过选择性移除参数知识来解决这一挑战，避免从头重新训练资源密集型模型如LLM。

Method: 引入Forgetting-MarI框架，通过惩罚边际信息来证明性地移除待遗忘数据的额外贡献，同时保留待保留数据支持的信息，提供明确的遗忘数据集残余影响上界。

Result: 广泛实验证实该方法优于当前最先进的遗忘方法，实现了可靠的遗忘效果，并在多样化基准测试中保持了更好的通用模型性能。

Conclusion: 这一进展代表了使AI系统更可控、更符合隐私和版权法规而不损害其有效性的重要一步。

Abstract: As AI models are trained on ever-expanding datasets, the ability to remove the influence of specific data from trained models has become essential for privacy protection and regulatory compliance. Unlearning addresses this challenge by selectively removing parametric knowledge from the trained models without retraining from scratch, which is critical for resource-intensive models such as Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing unlearning methods often degrade model performance by removing more information than necessary when attempting to ''forget'' specific data. We introduce Forgetting-MarI, an LLM unlearning framework that provably removes only the additional (marginal) information contributed by the data to be unlearned, while preserving the information supported by the data to be retained. By penalizing marginal information, our method yields an explicit upper bound on the unlearn dataset's residual influence in the trained models, providing provable undetectability. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art unlearning methods, delivering reliable forgetting and better preserved general model performance across diverse benchmarks. This advancement represents an important step toward making AI systems more controllable and compliant with privacy and copyright regulations without compromising their effectiveness.

Motivation: 系统评估大语言模型在抽象视觉推理问题中的性能表现，比较不同模型和推理架构的效果。

Method: 使用四种LLM模型和四种推理架构，通过三阶段处理流程生成视觉响应，采用SSIM和LPIPS指标评估，分析思维链分数和错误类型。

Result: GPT-4.1-Mini在所有架构中均获得最高准确率，多智能体架构对语义和数值平衡有影响但效果不一致，推理效果具有模型特异性。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在抽象视觉推理中的表现因模型而异，GPT-4.1-Mini表现最佳，多运行评估策略比单次运行更可靠。

Abstract: This study aims to systematically evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) in abstract visual reasoning problems. We examined four LLM models (GPT-4.1-Mini, Claude-3.5-Haiku, Gemini-1.5-Flash, Llama-3.3-70b) utilizing four different reasoning architectures (single-shot, embedding-controlled repetition, self-reflection, and multi-agent) on the RAVEN-FAIR dataset. Visual responses generated through a three-stage process (JSON extraction, LLM reasoning, and Tool Function) were evaluated using SSIM and LPIPS metrics; Chain-of-Thought scores and error types (semantic hallucination, numeric misperception) were analyzed. Results demonstrate that GPT-4.1-Mini consistently achieved the highest overall accuracy across all architectures, indicating a strong reasoning capability. While the multi-agent architecture occasionally altered semantic and numeric balance across models, these effects were not uniformly beneficial. Instead, each model exhibited distinct sensitivity patterns to architectural design, underscoring that reasoning effectiveness remains model-specific. Variations in response coverage further emerged as a confounding factor that complicates direct cross-architecture comparison. To estimate the upper-bound performance of each configuration, we report the best of five independent runs, representing a best-case scenario rather than an averaged outcome. This multi-run strategy aligns with recent recommendations, which emphasize that single-run evaluations are fragile and may lead to unreliable conclusions.

The proposed event-based framework addresses continuous rhythmic generation and discrete decision-making in a unified physical modeling language. We illustrate the versatility, robustness, and modularity of the architecture through the nervous system design of a snake robot.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In recent years, humanity has begun to experience the catastrophic effects of climate change as economic sectors (such as agriculture) struggle with unpredictable and extreme weather events. Artificial Intelligence (AI) should help us handle these climate challenges but its most promising solutions are not good at dealing with climate-disrupted data; specifically, machine learning methods that work from historical data-distributions, are not good at handling out-of-distribution, outlier events. In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation method, that treats the predictive problems around climate change as being, in part, due to class-imbalance issues; that is, prediction from historical datasets is difficult because, by definition, they lack sufficient minority-class instances of "climate outlier events". This novel data augmentation method -- called Counterfactual-Based SMOTE (CFA-SMOTE) -- combines an instance-based counterfactual method from Explainable AI (XAI) with the well-known class-imbalance method, SMOTE. CFA-SMOTE creates synthetic data-points representing outlier, climate-events that augment the dataset to improve predictive performance. We report comparative experiments using this CFA-SMOTE method, comparing it to benchmark counterfactual and class-imbalance methods under different conditions (i.e., class-imbalance ratios). The focal climate-change domain used relies on predicting grass growth on Irish dairy farms, during Europe-wide drought and forage crisis of 2018.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合大型语言模型和符号逻辑的混合神经符号框架，用于确定性检测复杂法律中的法规不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM方法在处理层次化处理和深度结构化推理方面存在困难，特别是在长文本中。税收法规的复杂性使其成为识别冲突的肥沃领域。

Method: 使用GPT-4o将美国国内税收法典第121条翻译为Prolog规则，并在SWISH中精炼。通过Prolog增强提示测试不一致性检测效果，并与纯自然语言提示对比。

Result: GPT-4o在三种策略中仅检测到一种不一致性（33%准确率）。纯自然语言提示实现100%规则覆盖，而Prolog增强提示仅66%覆盖。混合Prolog模型产生确定性结果，成功检测到不一致性区域。

Conclusion: 基于符号逻辑的LLM辅助形式化能够实现透明可靠的法规不一致性检测，混合方法优于纯概率性提示。

Abstract: This study introduces a hybrid neuro-symbolic framework that achieves deterministic detection of statutory inconsistency in complex law. We use the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (IRC) as a case study because its complexity makes it a fertile domain for identifying conflicts. Our research offers a solution for detecting inconsistent provisions by combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with symbolic logic.
  LLM-based methods can support compliance, fairness, and statutory drafting, yet tax-specific applications remain sparse. A key challenge is that such models struggle with hierarchical processing and deep structured reasoning, especially over long text.
  This research addresses these gaps through experiments using GPT-4o, GPT-5, and Prolog. GPT-4o was first used to translate Section 121 into Prolog rules and refine them in SWISH. These rules were then incorporated into prompts to test whether Prolog-augmented prompting improved GPT-4o's inconsistency detection. GPT-4o, whether prompted with natural language alone or with Prolog augmentation, detected the inconsistency in only one of three strategies (33 percent accuracy), but its reasoning quality differed: natural-language prompting achieved 100 percent rule coverage, while Prolog-augmented prompting achieved 66 percent, indicating more incomplete statutory analysis.
  In contrast to probabilistic prompting, the hybrid Prolog model produced deterministic and reproducible results. Guided by GPT-5 for refinement, the model formalized the IRC section's competing interpretations and successfully detected an inconsistency zone. Validation tests confirm that the Prolog implementation is accurate, internally consistent, deterministic, and capable of autonomously identifying inconsistencies. These findings show that LLM-assisted formalization, anchored in symbolic logic, enables transparent and reliable statutory inconsistency detection.

Motivation: 现有声明自动形式化方法缺乏上下文感知导致形式定义和定理的幻觉，且检索增强方法在形式库依赖检索上精度和召回率差，无法有效利用不断增长的公共数据集。

Method: 提出DDR方法：直接从自然语言数学描述生成候选库依赖，通过高效后缀数组检查验证其在形式库中的存在；构建50万+样本的依赖检索数据集并微调高精度DDR模型。

Result: DDR模型在检索精度和召回率上显著优于SOTA方法；配备DDR的自动形式化器在单次尝试准确率和多次尝试稳定性上均优于传统基于选择的RAG方法。

Conclusion: DDR框架通过直接依赖检索有效解决了声明自动形式化中的库依赖检索问题，为深度学习和形式数学的融合提供了更可靠的基础。

Abstract: The convergence of deep learning and formal mathematics has spurred research in formal verification. Statement autoformalization, a crucial first step in this process, aims to translate informal descriptions into machine-verifiable representations but remains a significant challenge. The core difficulty lies in the fact that existing methods often suffer from a lack of contextual awareness, leading to hallucination of formal definitions and theorems. Furthermore, current retrieval-augmented approaches exhibit poor precision and recall for formal library dependency retrieval, and lack the scalability to effectively leverage ever-growing public datasets. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel retrieval-augmented framework based on DDR (\textit{Direct Dependency Retrieval}) for statement autoformalization. Our DDR method directly generates candidate library dependencies from natural language mathematical descriptions and subsequently verifies their existence within the formal library via an efficient suffix array check. Leveraging this efficient search mechanism, we constructed a dependency retrieval dataset of over 500,000 samples and fine-tuned a high-precision DDR model. Experimental results demonstrate that our DDR model significantly outperforms SOTA methods in both retrieval precision and recall. Consequently, an autoformalizer equipped with DDR shows consistent performance advantages in both single-attempt accuracy and multi-attempt stability compared to models using traditional selection-based RAG methods.

Conclusion: LAT框架有效提升了视觉语言模型在视觉文档检索增强生成中的证据归因能力，实现了更可靠和可验证的多模态问答。

Abstract: Aiming to identify precise evidence sources from visual documents, visual evidence attribution for visual document retrieval-augmented generation (VD-RAG) ensures reliable and verifiable predictions from vision-language models (VLMs) in multimodal question answering. Most existing methods adopt end-to-end training to facilitate intuitive answer verification. However, they lack fine-grained supervision and progressive traceability throughout the reasoning process. In this paper, we introduce the Chain-of-Evidence (CoE) paradigm for VD-RAG. CoE unifies Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and visual evidence attribution by grounding reference elements in reasoning steps to specific regions with bounding boxes and page indexes. To enable VLMs to generate such evidence-grounded reasoning, we propose Look As You Think (LAT), a reinforcement learning framework that trains models to produce verifiable reasoning paths with consistent attribution. During training, LAT evaluates the attribution consistency of each evidence region and provides rewards only when the CoE trajectory yields correct answers, encouraging process-level self-verification. Experiments on vanilla Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct with Paper- and Wiki-VISA benchmarks show that LAT consistently improves the vanilla model in both single- and multi-image settings, yielding average gains of 8.23% in soft exact match (EM) and 47.0% in IoU@0.5. Meanwhile, LAT not only outperforms the supervised fine-tuning baseline, which is trained to directly produce answers with attribution, but also exhibits stronger generalization across domains.

Abstract: AI tools in pathology have improved screening throughput, standardized quantification, and revealed prognostic patterns that inform treatment. However, adoption remains limited because most systems still lack the human-readable reasoning needed to audit decisions and prevent errors. We present RECAP-PATH, an interpretable framework that establishes a self-learning paradigm, shifting off-the-shelf multimodal large language models from passive pattern recognition to evidence-linked diagnostic reasoning. At its core is a two-phase learning process that autonomously derives diagnostic criteria: diversification expands pathology-style explanations, while optimization refines them for accuracy. This self-learning approach requires only small labeled sets and no white-box access or weight updates to generate cancer diagnoses. Evaluated on breast and prostate datasets, RECAP-PATH produced rationales aligned with expert assessment and delivered substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy over baselines. By uniting visual understanding with reasoning, RECAP-PATH provides clinically trustworthy AI and demonstrates a generalizable path toward evidence-linked interpretation.

Abstract: The advent of smart manufacturing is addressing the limitations of traditional centralized scheduling and inflexible production line configurations in the rubber tyre industry, especially in terms of coping with dynamic production demands. Contemporary tyre manufacturing systems form complex networks of tightly coupled subsystems pronounced nonlinear interactions and emergent dynamics. This complexity renders the effective coordination of multiple subsystems, posing an essential yet formidable task. For high-dimensional, multi-objective optimization problems in this domain, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning algorithm: Multi-path Differentiated Clipping Proximal Policy Optimization (MPD-PPO). This algorithm employs a multi-branch policy architecture with differentiated gradient clipping constraints to ensure stable and efficient high-dimensional policy updates. Validated through experiments on width and thickness control in rubber tyre film production, MPD-PPO demonstrates substantial improvements in both tuning accuracy and operational efficiency. The framework successfully tackles key challenges, including high dimensionality, multi-objective trade-offs, and dynamic adaptation, thus delivering enhanced performance and production stability for real-time industrial deployment in tyre manufacturing.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently enabled self-improving AI, i.e., AI that iteratively generates, evaluates, and refines its own outcomes. Recent studies have shown that self-improving AI focusing on prompt optimization can outperform state-of-the-art reinforcement-learning fine-tuned LLMs. Here, their `performance' is typically measured by query efficiency - the number of LLM-generated solution samples required to meet a certain performance threshold. However, in many societal applications, the primary limitation is not generating new solutions but evaluating them. For instance, evaluating an ad's effectiveness requires significant human feedback, which is far more costly and time-consuming than generating a candidate ad. To optimize for the evaluation efficiency objective, a natural approach is to extend Bayesian Optimization (BO), a framework proven optimal for evaluation efficiency, to the language domain. However, the difficulty of directly estimating suitable acquisition functions in LLMs' minds makes this extension challenging. This paper overcomes this challenge by proving that the combination of the simple and widely used Best-of-N selection strategy and simple textual gradients (i.e., textual edits from a critic model) statistically emulates the behavior of the gradients on the canonical UCB acquisition function, which induces optimal exploration in terms of evaluation efficiency. Based on this result, we propose TextGrad-Best-of-N Bayesian Optimization (T-BoN BO), a simple and eval-efficient language-space Bayesian optimization framework for AI self-improvement. We also empirically validate T-BoN BO by applying it to automated ad alignment tasks for persona distribution, demonstrating its superior performance compared to popular state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: 这是扑克AI中首个通过低维嵌入预训练信息集抽象来进行策略求解的算法，能更精确地捕捉信息集间的区别和联系，提高求解质量。

Abstract: High-quality information set abstraction remains a core challenge in solving large-scale imperfect-information extensive-form games (IIEFGs)-such as no-limit Texas Hold'em-where the finite nature of spatial resources hinders strategy solving over the full game. State-of-the-art AI methods rely on pre-trained discrete clustering for abstraction, yet their hard classification irreversibly loses critical information: specifically, the quantifiable subtle differences between information sets-vital for strategy solving-thereby compromising the quality of such solving. Inspired by the word embedding paradigm in natural language processing, this paper proposes the Embedding CFR algorithm, a novel approach for solving strategies in IIEFGs within an embedding space. The algorithm pre-trains and embeds features of isolated information sets into an interconnected low-dimensional continuous space, where the resulting vectors more precisely capture both the distinctions and connections between information sets. Embedding CFR presents a strategy-solving process driven by regret accumulation and strategy updates within this embedding space, with accompanying theoretical analysis verifying its capacity to reduce cumulative regret. Experiments on poker show that with the same spatial overhead, Embedding CFR achieves significantly faster exploitability convergence compared to cluster-based abstraction algorithms, confirming its effectiveness. Furthermore, to our knowledge, it is the first algorithm in poker AI that pre-trains information set abstractions through low-dimensional embedding for strategy solving.

Motivation: 解决大规模不完全信息游戏中因极端不完美回忆抽象导致的过度抽象问题，这种抽象完全丢弃历史信息，严重损害AI性能。

Method: 提出k-recall winrate特征，利用未来和历史游戏信息区分信号观测信息集；开发KrwEmd算法，使用earth mover's distance测量特征差异来聚类信号观测信息集。

Result: 实验结果表明，KrwEmd相比现有算法显著提升了AI的游戏表现性能。

Conclusion: KrwEmd是首个实用的解决过度抽象问题的算法，通过有效利用历史信息改善了不完全信息游戏中的AI性能。

Abstract: Excessive abstraction is a critical challenge in hand abstraction-a task specific to games like Texas hold'em-when solving large-scale imperfect-information games, as it impairs AI performance. This issue arises from extreme implementations of imperfect-recall abstraction, which entirely discard historical information. This paper presents KrwEmd, the first practical algorithm designed to address this problem. We first introduce the k-recall winrate feature, which not only qualitatively distinguishes signal observation infosets by leveraging both future and, crucially, historical game information, but also quantitatively captures their similarity. We then develop the KrwEmd algorithm, which clusters signal observation infosets using earth mover's distance to measure discrepancies between their features. Experimental results demonstrate that KrwEmd significantly improves AI gameplay performance compared to existing algorithms.

Motivation: 现有数据集和微调方法在将大语言模型推理能力压缩到小模型时面临灾难性遗忘问题，特别是对于8B以下模型，难以保持先验知识。

Method: 1. 数据层面：构建包含多任务推理和元认知知识的5K数据集，基于任务知识和模型固有技能过滤数据；2. 训练层面：提出GDPO方法，通过参考模型隐式约束优化路径，有效限制参数漂移。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法显著缓解了灾难性遗忘问题，并提高了小模型的推理性能。

Conclusion: 提出的综合解决方案从数据和训练方法两个角度有效解决了小模型知识蒸馏中的灾难性遗忘问题，实现了更好的知识迁移。

Abstract: Large Language Models demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities, which can be effectively compressed into smaller models. However, existing datasets and fine-tuning approaches still face challenges that lead to catastrophic forgetting, particularly for models smaller than 8B. First, most datasets typically ignore the relationship between training data knowledge and the model's inherent abilities, making it difficult to preserve prior knowledge. Second, conventional training objectives often fail to constrain inherent knowledge preservation, which can result in forgetting of previously learned skills. To address these issues, we propose a comprehensive solution that alleviates catastrophic forgetting from both the data and fine-tuning approach perspectives. On the data side, we construct a dataset of 5K instances that covers multiple reasoning tasks and incorporates metacognitive knowledge, making it more tolerant and effective for distillation into smaller models. We annotate the metacognitive knowledge required to solve each question and filter the data based on task knowledge and the model's inherent skills. On the training side, we introduce GDPO (Group Direction Preference Optimization), which is better suited for resource-limited scenarios and can efficiently approximate the performance of GRPO. Guided by the large model and by implicitly constraining the optimization path through a reference model, GDPO enables more effective knowledge transfer from the large model and constrains excessive parameter drift. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly alleviates catastrophic forgetting and improves reasoning performance on smaller models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将分子描述和文本到分子设计视为独立任务，存在三个关键问题：传统指标优先语言流畅性而非化学准确性；训练数据包含化学模糊描述；独立优化导致双向不一致。

Method: 提出RTMol框架，通过自监督往返学习统一分子描述和文本到SMILES生成，引入新颖的往返评估指标，支持无需配对分子-文本语料的无监督训练。

Result: 实验表明RTMol在各种LLMs上将双向对齐性能提升高达47%，建立了有效的联合分子-文本理解和生成范式。

Conclusion: RTMol通过双向对齐框架成功解决了分子序列表示与文本描述对齐的关键挑战，为药物发现、材料设计等应用提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Aligning molecular sequence representations (e.g., SMILES notations) with textual descriptions is critical for applications spanning drug discovery, materials design, and automated chemical literature analysis. Existing methodologies typically treat molecular captioning (molecule-to-text) and text-based molecular design (text-to-molecule) as separate tasks, relying on supervised fine-tuning or contrastive learning pipelines. These approaches face three key limitations: (i) conventional metrics like BLEU prioritize linguistic fluency over chemical accuracy, (ii) training datasets frequently contain chemically ambiguous narratives with incomplete specifications, and (iii) independent optimization of generation directions leads to bidirectional inconsistency. To address these issues, we propose RTMol, a bidirectional alignment framework that unifies molecular captioning and text-to-SMILES generation through self-supervised round-trip learning. The framework introduces novel round-trip evaluation metrics and enables unsupervised training for molecular captioning without requiring paired molecule-text corpora. Experiments demonstrate that RTMol enhances bidirectional alignment performance by up to 47% across various LLMs, establishing an effective paradigm for joint molecule-text understanding and generation.

Motivation: 现有DatalogMTL推理方法缺乏对动态更新的高效支持，而现实应用需要频繁数据更新

Method: 基于经典DRed算法，设计专门操作符处理DatalogMTL物化的周期性区间表示

Result: 实验结果显示DRedMTL通常显著优于重新物化方法，有时性能提升数个数量级

Conclusion: DRedMTL为DatalogMTL提供了高效的增量推理能力，适用于需要频繁更新的现实应用

Abstract: DatalogMTL extends the classical Datalog language with metric temporal logic (MTL), enabling expressive reasoning over temporal data. While existing reasoning approaches, such as materialisation based and automata based methods, offer soundness and completeness, they lack support for handling efficient dynamic updates, a crucial requirement for real-world applications that involve frequent data updates. In this work, we propose DRedMTL, an incremental reasoning algorithm for DatalogMTL with bounded intervals. Our algorithm builds upon the classical DRed algorithm, which incrementally updates the materialisation of a Datalog program. Unlike a Datalog materialisation which is in essence a finite set of facts, a DatalogMTL materialisation has to be represented as a finite set of facts plus periodic intervals indicating how the full materialisation can be constructed through unfolding. To cope with this, our algorithm is equipped with specifically designed operators to efficiently handle such periodic representations of DatalogMTL materialisations. We have implemented this approach and tested it on several publicly available datasets. Experimental results show that DRedMTL often significantly outperforms rematerialisation, sometimes by orders of magnitude.

Result: 在实验中，DoM始终优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: DoM框架通过多智能体辩论有效解决了不完整知识图谱问答问题，并创建了更真实的基准数据集来评估此类方法。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) aims to improve factual accuracy by leveraging structured knowledge. However, real-world Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are often incomplete, leading to the problem of Incomplete KGQA (IKGQA). A common solution is to incorporate external data to fill knowledge gaps, but existing methods lack the capacity to adaptively and contextually fuse multiple sources, failing to fully exploit their complementary strengths. To this end, we propose Debate over Mixed-knowledge (DoM), a novel framework that enables dynamic integration of structured and unstructured knowledge for IKGQA. Built upon the Multi-Agent Debate paradigm, DoM assigns specialized agents to perform inference over knowledge graphs and external texts separately, and coordinates their outputs through iterative interaction. It decomposes the input question into sub-questions, retrieves evidence via dual agents (KG and Retrieval-Augmented Generation, RAG), and employs a judge agent to evaluate and aggregate intermediate answers. This collaboration exploits knowledge complementarity and enhances robustness to KG incompleteness. In addition, existing IKGQA datasets simulate incompleteness by randomly removing triples, failing to capture the irregular and unpredictable nature of real-world knowledge incompleteness. To address this, we introduce a new dataset, Incomplete Knowledge Graph WebQuestions, constructed by leveraging real-world knowledge updates. These updates reflect knowledge beyond the static scope of KGs, yielding a more realistic and challenging benchmark. Through extensive experiments, we show that DoM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: ViTE通过虚拟图和专家路由器的组合，实现了灵活可扩展的交互推理，在行人轨迹预测任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Pedestrian trajectory prediction is critical for ensuring safety in autonomous driving, surveillance systems, and urban planning applications. While early approaches primarily focus on one-hop pairwise relationships, recent studies attempt to capture high-order interactions by stacking multiple Graph Neural Network (GNN) layers. However, these approaches face a fundamental trade-off: insufficient layers may lead to under-reaching problems that limit the model's receptive field, while excessive depth can result in prohibitive computational costs. We argue that an effective model should be capable of adaptively modeling both explicit one-hop interactions and implicit high-order dependencies, rather than relying solely on architectural depth. To this end, we propose ViTE (Virtual graph Trajectory Expert router), a novel framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction. ViTE consists of two key modules: a Virtual Graph that introduces dynamic virtual nodes to model long-range and high-order interactions without deep GNN stacks, and an Expert Router that adaptively selects interaction experts based on social context using a Mixture-of-Experts design. This combination enables flexible and scalable reasoning across varying interaction patterns. Experiments on three benchmarks (ETH/UCY, NBA, and SDD) demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating both its effectiveness and practical efficiency.

Result: 这些哲学观点虽非普遍定义，但有助于探索世界模型的局限性

Conclusion: 世界模型框架在表征人类水平理解方面存在局限性

Abstract: World models have garnered substantial interest in the AI community. These are internal representations that simulate aspects of the external world, track entities and states, capture causal relationships, and enable prediction of consequences. This contrasts with representations based solely on statistical correlations. A key motivation behind this research direction is that humans possess such mental world models, and finding evidence of similar representations in AI models might indicate that these models "understand" the world in a human-like way. In this paper, we use case studies from the philosophy of science literature to critically examine whether the world model framework adequately characterizes human-level understanding. We focus on specific philosophical analyses where the distinction between world model capabilities and human understanding is most pronounced. While these represent particular views of understanding rather than universal definitions, they help us explore the limits of world models.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了开发隐私保护、可复现的患者安全监测系统的新途径，具有在ICU部署的潜力。

Abstract: Unplanned extubation (UE) remains a critical patient safety concern in intensive care units (ICUs), often leading to severe complications or death. Real-time UE detection has been limited, largely due to the ethical and privacy challenges of obtaining annotated ICU video data. We propose Augmented Unplanned Removal Alert (AURA), a vision-based risk detection system developed and validated entirely on a fully synthetic video dataset. By leveraging text-to-video diffusion, we generated diverse and clinically realistic ICU scenarios capturing a range of patient behaviors and care contexts. The system applies pose estimation to identify two high-risk movement patterns: collision, defined as hand entry into spatial zones near airway tubes, and agitation, quantified by the velocity of tracked anatomical keypoints. Expert assessments confirmed the realism of the synthetic data, and performance evaluations showed high accuracy for collision detection and moderate performance for agitation recognition. This work demonstrates a novel pathway for developing privacy-preserving, reproducible patient safety monitoring systems with potential for deployment in intensive care settings.

Conclusion: 该框架为上下文感知、可靠的多智能体移动自动化建立了稳健的范式。

Abstract: Mobile agents show immense potential, yet current state-of-the-art (SoTA) agents exhibit inadequate success rates on real-world, long-horizon, cross-application tasks. We attribute this bottleneck to the agents' excessive reliance on static, internal knowledge within MLLMs, which leads to two critical failure points: 1) strategic hallucinations in high-level planning and 2) operational errors during low-level execution on user interfaces (UI). The core insight of this paper is that high-level planning and low-level UI operations require fundamentally distinct types of knowledge. Planning demands high-level, strategy-oriented experiences, whereas operations necessitate low-level, precise instructions closely tied to specific app UIs. Motivated by these insights, we propose Mobile-Agent-RAG, a novel hierarchical multi-agent framework that innovatively integrates dual-level retrieval augmentation. At the planning stage, we introduce Manager-RAG to reduce strategic hallucinations by retrieving human-validated comprehensive task plans that provide high-level guidance. At the execution stage, we develop Operator-RAG to improve execution accuracy by retrieving the most precise low-level guidance for accurate atomic actions, aligned with the current app and subtask. To accurately deliver these knowledge types, we construct two specialized retrieval-oriented knowledge bases. Furthermore, we introduce Mobile-Eval-RAG, a challenging benchmark for evaluating such agents on realistic multi-app, long-horizon tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mobile-Agent-RAG significantly outperforms SoTA baselines, improving task completion rate by 11.0% and step efficiency by 10.2%, establishing a robust paradigm for context-aware, reliable multi-agent mobile automation.

Motivation: 大型语言模型对人类道德决策的影响日益增强，但现有方法主要关注评估而非主动引导其道德决策。需要解决LLM在超出训练分布场景中的道德对齐问题。

Method: 构建包含680个人工标注、高模糊性道德场景的Moral-Reason-QA数据集，采用Group Relative Policy Optimization学习框架，通过复合奖励同时优化决策对齐和框架特定推理过程。

Result: 在未见道德场景上实现成功泛化，功利主义框架的softmax归一化对齐分数提高+0.757，义务论框架提高+0.450。

Conclusion: LLM代理能够被系统训练以内在化并将特定道德框架应用于新情境，为AI安全提供了关键基础。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly influencing human moral decisions, yet current approaches focus primarily on evaluating rather than actively steering their moral decisions. We formulate this as an out-of-distribution moral alignment problem, where LLM agents must learn to apply consistent moral reasoning frameworks to scenarios beyond their training distribution. We introduce Moral-Reason-QA, a novel dataset extending 680 human-annotated, high-ambiguity moral scenarios with framework-specific reasoning traces across utilitarian, deontological, and virtue ethics, enabling systematic evaluation of moral generalization in realistic decision contexts. Our learning approach employs Group Relative Policy Optimization with composite rewards that simultaneously optimize decision alignment and framework-specific reasoning processes to facilitate learning of the underlying moral frameworks. Experimental results demonstrate successful generalization to unseen moral scenarios, with softmax-normalized alignment scores improving by +0.757 for utilitarian and +0.450 for deontological frameworks when tested on out-of-distribution evaluation sets. The experiments also reveal training challenges and promising directions that inform future research. These findings establish that LLM agents can be systematically trained to internalize and apply specific moral frameworks to novel situations, providing a critical foundation for AI safety as language models become more integrated into human decision-making processes.

Abstract: As large language model (LLM) agents increasingly undertake digital work, reliable frameworks are needed to evaluate their real-world competence, adaptability, and capacity for human collaboration. Existing benchmarks remain largely static, synthetic, or domain-limited, providing limited insight into how agents perform in dynamic, economically meaningful environments. We introduce UpBench, a dynamically evolving benchmark grounded in real jobs drawn from the global Upwork labor marketplace. Each task corresponds to a verified client transaction, anchoring evaluation in genuine work activity and financial outcomes. UpBench employs a rubric-based evaluation framework, in which expert freelancers decompose each job into detailed, verifiable acceptance criteria and assess AI submissions with per-criterion feedback. This structure enables fine-grained analysis of model strengths, weaknesses, and instruction-following fidelity beyond binary pass/fail metrics. Human expertise is integrated throughout the data pipeline (from job curation and rubric construction to evaluation) ensuring fidelity to real professional standards and supporting research on human-AI collaboration. By regularly refreshing tasks to reflect the evolving nature of online work, UpBench provides a scalable, human-centered foundation for evaluating agentic systems in authentic labor-market contexts, offering a path toward a collaborative framework, where AI amplifies human capability through partnership rather than replacement.

Conclusion: RGR-GRPO通过评分标准驱动的RL框架有效突破了现有性能瓶颈，在多领域推理任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly improved the complex reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite these successes, existing methods mainly focus on single-domain RL (e.g., mathematics) with verifiable rewards (RLVR), and their reliance on purely online RL frameworks restricts the exploration space, thereby limiting reasoning performance. In this paper, we address these limitations by leveraging rubrics to provide both fine-grained reward signals and offline guidance. We propose $\textbf{RGR-GRPO}$ (Reward and Guidance through Rubrics), a rubric-driven RL framework for multi-domain reasoning. RGR-GRPO enables LLMs to receive dense and informative rewards while exploring a larger solution space during GRPO training. Extensive experiments across 14 benchmarks spanning multiple domains demonstrate that RGR-GRPO consistently outperforms RL methods that rely solely on alternative reward schemes or offline guidance. Compared with verifiable online RL baseline, RGR-GRPO achieves average improvements of +7.0%, +5.4%, +8.4%, and +6.6% on mathematics, physics, chemistry, and general reasoning tasks, respectively. Notably, RGR-GRPO maintains stable entropy fluctuations during off-policy training and achieves superior pass@k performance, reflecting sustained exploration and effective breakthrough beyond existing performance bottlenecks.

Abstract: Despite the explosive growth of AI and the technologies built upon it, predicting and inferring the sub-optimal behavior of users or human collaborators remains a critical challenge. In many cases, such behaviors are not a result of irrationality, but rather a rational decision made given inherent cognitive bounds and biased beliefs about the world. In this paper, we formally introduce a class of computational-rational (CR) user models for cognitively-bounded agents acting optimally under biased beliefs. The key novelty lies in explicitly modeling how a bounded memory process leads to a dynamically inconsistent and biased belief state and, consequently, sub-optimal sequential decision-making. We address the challenge of identifying the latent user-specific bound and inferring biased belief states from passive observations on the fly. We argue that for our formalized CR model family with an explicit and parameterized cognitive process, this challenge is tractable. To support our claim, we propose an efficient online inference method based on nested particle filtering that simultaneously tracks the user's latent belief state and estimates the unknown cognitive bound from a stream of observed actions. We validate our approach in a representative navigation task using memory decay as an example of a cognitive bound. With simulations, we show that (1) our CR model generates intuitively plausible behaviors corresponding to different levels of memory capacity, and (2) our inference method accurately and efficiently recovers the ground-truth cognitive bounds from limited observations ($\le 100$ steps). We further demonstrate how this approach provides a principled foundation for developing adaptive AI assistants, enabling adaptive assistance that accounts for the user's memory limitations.

Abstract: Autonomous agents operating in sequential decision-making tasks under uncertainty can benefit from external action suggestions, which provide valuable guidance but inherently vary in reliability. Existing methods for incorporating such advice typically assume static and known suggester quality parameters, limiting practical deployment. We introduce a framework that dynamically learns and adapts to varying suggester reliability in partially observable environments. First, we integrate suggester quality directly into the agent's belief representation, enabling agents to infer and adjust their reliance on suggestions through Bayesian inference over suggester types. Second, we introduce an explicit ``ask'' action allowing agents to strategically request suggestions at critical moments, balancing informational gains against acquisition costs. Experimental evaluation demonstrates robust performance across varying suggester qualities, adaptation to changing reliability, and strategic management of suggestion requests.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线健康资源和大型语言模型在医疗决策中存在准确性低、透明度差、易受未验证信息影响等问题，需要更可靠的患者决策支持系统。

Method: 采用多智能体框架：检索智能体识别相关流程图，决策智能体解释患者回答，聊天智能体提供个性化建议。基于美国医学会100个临床验证流程图构建结构化框架。

Result: 在合成数据集测试中，流程图检索达到95.29%的top-3准确率（N=2,000），流程图导航达到99.10%准确率（N=37,200），适应不同对话风格和条件。

Conclusion: 结合自由文本交互的灵活性和标准化临床协议的严谨性，证明了透明、准确、可推广的AI辅助自我分诊的可行性，有望支持患者知情决策并改善医疗资源利用。

Abstract: Online health resources and large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as a first point of contact for medical decision-making, yet their reliability in healthcare remains limited by low accuracy, lack of transparency, and susceptibility to unverified information. We introduce a proof-of-concept conversational self-triage system that guides LLMs with 100 clinically validated flowcharts from the American Medical Association, providing a structured and auditable framework for patient decision support. The system leverages a multi-agent framework consisting of a retrieval agent, a decision agent, and a chat agent to identify the most relevant flowchart, interpret patient responses, and deliver personalized, patient-friendly recommendations, respectively. Performance was evaluated at scale using synthetic datasets of simulated conversations. The system achieved 95.29% top-3 accuracy in flowchart retrieval (N=2,000) and 99.10% accuracy in flowchart navigation across varied conversational styles and conditions (N=37,200). By combining the flexibility of free-text interaction with the rigor of standardized clinical protocols, this approach demonstrates the feasibility of transparent, accurate, and generalizable AI-assisted self-triage, with potential to support informed patient decision-making while improving healthcare resource utilization.

*Pengze Li,Jiaqi Liu,Junchi Yu,Lihao Liu,Mingyu Ding,Wanli Ouyang,Shixiang Tang,Xi Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了ARCHE任务和ARCHE Bench基准，用于评估LLMs从科学文献中提取结构化推理链的能力，发现现有模型在推理准确性和内容完整性之间存在权衡，无法提取完整的标准推理链。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs虽然能通过思维链等方法生成类似推理的内容，但这些输出通常是非结构化和非正式的，难以判断模型是否真正理解科学推理的基本范式。

Method: 引入ARCHE任务，要求模型将复杂推理分解为标准推理范式组成的推理逻辑树(RLT)，其中所有推理步骤都明确分类为皮尔斯三种基本推理模式之一：演绎、归纳或溯因。

Result: 在基于70篇Nature Communications文章构建的ARCHE Bench基准上评估10个领先LLMs，发现模型在推理边准确性和实体覆盖率之间存在权衡，且都无法提取完整且标准的推理链。

Conclusion: 当前推理模型的能力与科学论证所需的严谨性之间存在显著差距，需要进一步改进模型以更好地理解和提取科学推理结构。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in scientific domains. While they can produce reasoning-like content via methods such as chain-of-thought prompting, these outputs are typically unstructured and informal, obscuring whether models truly understand the fundamental reasoning paradigms that underpin scientific inference. To address this, we introduce a novel task named Latent Reasoning Chain Extraction (ARCHE), in which models must decompose complex reasoning arguments into combinations of standard reasoning paradigms in the form of a Reasoning Logic Tree (RLT). In RLT, all reasoning steps are explicitly categorized as one of three variants of Peirce's fundamental inference modes: deduction, induction, or abduction. To facilitate this task, we release ARCHE Bench, a new benchmark derived from 70 Nature Communications articles, including more than 1,900 references and 38,000 viewpoints. We propose two logic-aware evaluation metrics: Entity Coverage (EC) for content completeness and Reasoning Edge Accuracy (REA) for step-by-step logical validity. Evaluations on 10 leading LLMs on ARCHE Bench reveal that models exhibit a trade-off between REA and EC, and none are yet able to extract a complete and standard reasoning chain. These findings highlight a substantial gap between the abilities of current reasoning models and the rigor required for scientific argumentation.

TL;DR: LOBERT是一个针对限价订单簿数据的通用基础模型，通过创新的标记化方案处理多维消息，在预测中间价格变动和下一消息等任务中表现领先。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于事件时间不规则、制度快速变化以及高频交易者对可见订单流的反应，在消息级别建模限价订单簿动态具有挑战性。现有模型需要繁琐的数据表示，且缺乏原始任务外的适应性。

Method: LOBERT基于BERT架构，采用新颖的标记化方案，将完整的多维消息视为单个标记，同时保留价格、数量和时间的连续表示。

Result: LOBERT在预测中间价格变动和下一消息等任务中取得领先性能，同时相比先前方法减少了所需的上下文长度。

Conclusion: LOBERT为LOB数据提供了一个通用的基础模型，适合下游微调，在处理多维消息和保留连续表示方面表现出色。

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of financial Limit Order Books (LOB) at the message level is challenging due to irregular event timing, rapid regime shifts, and the reactions of high-frequency traders to visible order flow. Previous LOB models require cumbersome data representations and lack adaptability outside their original tasks, leading us to introduce LOBERT, a general-purpose encoder-only foundation model for LOB data suitable for downstream fine-tuning. LOBERT adapts the original BERT architecture for LOB data by using a novel tokenization scheme that treats complete multi-dimensional messages as single tokens while retaining continuous representations of price, volume, and time. With these methods, LOBERT achieves leading performance in tasks such as predicting mid-price movements and next messages, while reducing the required context length compared to previous methods.

Result: 在推荐和对话质量方面持续优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: PCRS-TKA通过结构感知推理、知识筛选和协作偏好建模，有效提升了对话推荐系统的性能和准确性。

Abstract: Recent advances in pretrained language models (PLMs) have significantly improved conversational recommender systems (CRS), enabling more fluent and context-aware interactions. To further enhance accuracy and mitigate hallucination, many methods integrate PLMs with knowledge graphs (KGs), but face key challenges: failing to fully exploit PLM reasoning over graph relationships, indiscriminately incorporating retrieved knowledge without context filtering, and neglecting collaborative preferences in multi-turn dialogues. To this end, we propose PCRS-TKA, a prompt-based framework employing retrieval-augmented generation to integrate PLMs with KGs. PCRS-TKA constructs dialogue-specific knowledge trees from KGs and serializes them into texts, enabling structure-aware reasoning while capturing rich entity semantics. Our approach selectively filters context-relevant knowledge and explicitly models collaborative preferences using specialized supervision signals. A semantic alignment module harmonizes heterogeneous inputs, reducing noise and enhancing accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PCRS-TKA consistently outperforms all baselines in both recommendation and conversational quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大型任务的显式状态空间搜索中，紧凑表示生成状态集是一个核心挑战。静态树数据库虽然每个状态只需要恒定空间，但需要大量内存预分配。

Method: 开发了一种动态树数据库变体，用于压缩命题和数值变量的状态集，并证明其保持了静态版本的理想特性。

Result: 在经典和数值规划任务上的实证评估显示，压缩比达到几个数量级，且运行时开销通常可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 动态树数据库在状态压缩方面表现出色，为大规模状态空间搜索提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: A central challenge in scaling up explicit state-space search for large tasks is compactly representing the set of generated states. Tree databases, a data structure from model checking, require constant space per generated state in the best case, but they need a large preallocation of memory. We propose a novel dynamic variant of tree databases for compressing state sets over propositional and numeric variables and prove that it maintains the desirable properties of the static counterpart. Our empirical evaluation of state compression techniques for grounded and lifted planning on classical and numeric planning tasks reveals compression ratios of several orders of magnitude, often with negligible runtime overhead.

Conclusion: 提出的策略条件合作者框架能够有效表示、分类和实时适应广泛的伙伴策略，在复杂协作任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Adaptation is the cornerstone of effective collaboration among heterogeneous team members. In human-agent teams, artificial agents need to adapt to their human partners in real time, as individuals often have unique preferences and policies that may change dynamically throughout interactions. This becomes particularly challenging in tasks with time pressure and complex strategic spaces, where identifying partner behaviors and selecting suitable responses is difficult. In this work, we introduce a strategy-conditioned cooperator framework that learns to represent, categorize, and adapt to a broad range of potential partner strategies in real-time. Our approach encodes strategies with a variational autoencoder to learn a latent strategy space from agent trajectory data, identifies distinct strategy types through clustering, and trains a cooperator agent conditioned on these clusters by generating partners of each strategy type. For online adaptation to novel partners, we leverage a fixed-share regret minimization algorithm that dynamically infers and adjusts the partner's strategy estimation during interaction. We evaluate our method in a modified version of the Overcooked domain, a complex collaborative cooking environment that requires effective coordination among two players with a diverse potential strategy space. Through these experiments and an online user study, we demonstrate that our proposed agent achieves state of the art performance compared to existing baselines when paired with novel human, and agent teammates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨现代高维嵌入空间是否能提供足够好的表示，使算法能够复现人类在语义流畅性任务中观察到的觅食式行为模式。

Method: 使用最先进的嵌入技术和先前的语义流畅性数据，在嵌入空间中进行随机游走和Metropolis-Hastings采样，比较它们与人类行为的匹配程度。

Result: 随机游走在嵌入空间中产生了与最优觅食和边际价值定理一致的结果，而Metropolis-Hastings采样未能复现人类行为模式。

Conclusion: 适当结构的嵌入空间即使使用简单采样也能产生接近最优的觅食动态，挑战了复杂采样机制必然能更好模拟记忆检索的假设，支持Hills(2012)而非Abbott(2015)的观点。

Abstract: Human memory retrieval often resembles ecological foraging where animals search for food in a patchy environment. Optimal foraging means following the Marginal Value Theorem (MVT), in which individuals exploit a patch of semantically related concepts until it becomes less rewarding and then switch to a new cluster. While human behavioral data suggests foraging-like patterns in semantic fluency tasks, it remains unclear whether modern high-dimensional embedding spaces provide representations that allow algorithms to match observed human behavior. Using state-of-the-art embeddings and prior semantic fluency data, I find that random walks on these embedding spaces produce results consistent with optimal foraging and the MVT. Surprisingly, introducing Metropolis-Hastings sampling, an adaptive algorithm expected to model strategic acceptance and rejection of new clusters, does not produce results consistent with human behavior. These findings challenge the assumption that more complex sampling mechanisms inherently lead to better cognitive models of memory retrieval. Instead, they show that appropriately structured embeddings, even with simple sampling, can produce near-optimal foraging dynamics. This supports the perspective of Hills (2012) rather than Abbott (2015), demonstrating that modern embeddings can approximate human memory foraging without relying on complex acceptance criteria.

Motivation: 传统时空图神经网络在处理非重复性交通事件（如事故）时性能急剧下降，因为它们本质上是相关性模型，无法处理中断期间引入的新因果因素。

Method: 使用大语言模型量化非结构化事件报告，通过估计平均处理效应构建因果知识库，并采用双流GNN-LSTM网络结合新型因果注意力机制来调整和增强预测。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，Event-CausNet将预测误差（MAE）降低了35.87%，显著优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架弥合了相关性模型与因果推理之间的差距，提供了更准确、可迁移且具有关键可解释性的解决方案，为关键中断期间的实际交通管理提供了更可靠的基础。

Abstract: While spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at modeling recurring traffic patterns, their reliability plummets during non-recurring events like accidents. This failure occurs because GNNs are fundamentally correlational models, learning historical patterns that are invalidated by the new causal factors introduced during disruptions. To address this, we propose Event-CausNet, a framework that uses a Large Language Model to quantify unstructured event reports, builds a causal knowledge base by estimating average treatment effects, and injects this knowledge into a dual-stream GNN-LSTM network using a novel causal attention mechanism to adjust and enhance the forecast. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that Event-CausNet achieves robust performance, reducing prediction error (MAE) by up to 35.87%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our framework bridges the gap between correlational models and causal reasoning, providing a solution that is more accurate and transferable, while also offering crucial interpretability, providing a more reliable foundation for real-world traffic management during critical disruptions.

Abstract: This work investigates resource optimization in heterogeneous satellite clusters performing autonomous Earth Observation (EO) missions using Reinforcement Learning (RL). In the proposed setting, two optical satellites and one Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite operate cooperatively in low Earth orbit to capture ground targets and manage their limited onboard resources efficiently. Traditional optimization methods struggle to handle the real-time, uncertain, and decentralized nature of EO operations, motivating the use of RL and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for adaptive decision-making. This study systematically formulates the optimization problem from single-satellite to multi-satellite scenarios, addressing key challenges including energy and memory constraints, partial observability, and agent heterogeneity arising from diverse payload capabilities. Using a near-realistic simulation environment built on the Basilisk and BSK-RL frameworks, we evaluate the performance and stability of state-of-the-art MARL algorithms such as MAPPO, HAPPO, and HATRPO. Results show that MARL enables effective coordination across heterogeneous satellites, balancing imaging performance and resource utilization while mitigating non-stationarity and inter-agent reward coupling. The findings provide practical insights into scalable, autonomous satellite operations and contribute a foundation for future research on intelligent EO mission planning under heterogeneous and dynamic conditions.

Abstract: Solving Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) problems with neural networks is a key challenge in Neural-Symbolic Ar- tificial Intelligence (AI). While most research has focused on designing novel network architectures for individual prob- lems, less effort has been devoted to exploring new learning paradigms involving a sequence of problems. In this work, we investigate lifelong learning ILP, which leverages the com- positional and transferable nature of logic rules for efficient learning of new problems. We introduce a compositional framework, demonstrating how logic rules acquired from ear- lier tasks can be efficiently reused in subsequent ones, leading to improved scalability and performance. We formalize our approach and empirically evaluate it on sequences of tasks. Experimental results validate the feasibility and advantages of this paradigm, opening new directions for continual learn- ing in Neural-Symbolic AI.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a methodology that aligns agent behavior with human preferences by integrating human feedback into the agent's training process. We introduce a possible framework that employs passive Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) to guide agent training from implicit neural signals. We present and release a novel dataset of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) recordings collected from 25 human participants across three domains: a Pick-and-Place Robot, Lunar Lander, and Flappy Bird. We train classifiers to predict levels of agent performance (optimal, sub-optimal, or worst-case) from windows of preprocessed fNIRS feature vectors, achieving an average F1 score of 67% for binary classification and 46% for multi-class models averaged across conditions and domains. We also train regressors to predict the degree of deviation between an agent's chosen action and a set of near-optimal policies, providing a continuous measure of performance. We evaluate cross-subject generalization and demonstrate that fine-tuning pre-trained models with a small sample of subject-specific data increases average F1 scores by 17% and 41% for binary and multi-class models, respectively. Our work demonstrates that mapping implicit fNIRS signals to agent performance is feasible and can be improved, laying the foundation for future brain-driven RLHF systems.

Abstract: Bootstrapping large language models (LLMs) through preference-based policy optimization offers a promising direction for aligning model behavior with human preferences without relying on extensive manual annotations. In this work, we propose a novel preference-based policy optimization (PbPO) framework that formulates the learning process as a min-max game between the main policy and a reward model (RM). The RM is constrained within a confidence set derived from preference data to ensure reliable exploitation. Our iterative online algorithm actively collects preference data through guided exploration of the evolving policy, enabling continual self-improvement of both the policy and the RM. We provide theoretical guarantees for our method, establishing high-probability regret bounds for both settings with sequence-level RM and token-level RM, demonstrating its effectiveness in bootstrapping LLMs. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art preference optimization techniques.

Motivation: 现实经济决策不仅依赖结构化信号，还涉及非结构化语言信息。传统多智能体强化学习难以处理语言的语义模糊性和上下文丰富性。

Method: 提出LAMP框架，采用Think-Speak-Decide三阶段流程：Think阶段解释数值观测并缓存推理轨迹；Speak阶段生成和交换战略消息；Decide阶段融合数值数据、推理和反思到MARL策略中。

Result: 在经济模拟实验中，LAMP在累积回报（+63.5%，+34.0%）、鲁棒性（+18.8%，+59.4%）和可解释性方面均优于MARL和LLM基线方法。

Conclusion: 语言增强策略具有开发更有效和鲁棒经济策略的潜力，缩小了与现实世界设置的差距。

Abstract: Economic decision-making depends not only on structured signals such as prices and taxes, but also on unstructured language, including peer dialogue and media narratives. While multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown promise in optimizing economic decisions, it struggles with the semantic ambiguity and contextual richness of language. We propose LAMP (Language-Augmented Multi-Agent Policy), a framework that integrates language into economic decision-making and narrows the gap to real-world settings. LAMP follows a Think-Speak-Decide pipeline: (1) Think interprets numerical observations to extract short-term shocks and long-term trends, caching high-value reasoning trajectories; (2) Speak crafts and exchanges strategic messages based on reasoning, updating beliefs by parsing peer communications; and (3) Decide fuses numerical data, reasoning, and reflections into a MARL policy to optimize language-augmented decision-making. Experiments in economic simulation show that LAMP outperforms both MARL and LLM-only baselines in cumulative return (+63.5%, +34.0%), robustness (+18.8%, +59.4%), and interpretability. These results demonstrate the potential of language-augmented policies to deliver more effective and robust economic strategies.

Result: 在两个领域进行的实验表明，在线学习过程减少了ChatGPT调用次数，同时解决了至少同样多的问题，在某些情况下甚至更多。

Conclusion: 在线学习HTN方法能有效减少对大型语言模型的依赖，提高规划系统的效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: We present online learning of Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) methods in the context of integrated HTN planning and LLM-based chatbots. Methods indicate when and how to decompose tasks into subtasks. Our method learner is built on top of the ChatHTN planner. ChatHTN queries ChatGPT to generate a decomposition of a task into primitive tasks when no applicable method for the task is available. In this work, we extend ChatHTN. Namely, when ChatGPT generates a task decomposition, ChatHTN learns from it, akin to memoization. However, unlike memoization, it learns a generalized method that applies not only to the specific instance encountered, but to other instances of the same task. We conduct experiments on two domains and demonstrate that our online learning procedure reduces the number of calls to ChatGPT while solving at least as many problems, and in some cases, even more.

Conclusion: CoS框架成功激活了LLM的事件调度能力，在效率和效果之间取得了良好平衡，并展示了强大的泛化性能。

Abstract: Recommending event schedules is a key issue in Event-based Social Networks (EBSNs) in order to maintain user activity. An effective recommendation is required to maximize the user's preference, subjecting to both time and geographical constraints. Existing methods face an inherent trade-off among efficiency, effectiveness, and generalization, due to the NP-hard nature of the problem. This paper proposes the Chain-of-Scheduling (CoS) framework, which activates the event scheduling capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) through a guided, efficient scheduling process. CoS enhances LLM by formulating the schedule task into three atomic stages, i.e., exploration, verification and integration. Then we enable the LLMs to generate CoS autonomously via Knowledge Distillation (KD). Experimental results show that CoS achieves near-theoretical optimal effectiveness with high efficiency on three real-world datasets in a interpretable manner. Moreover, it demonstrates strong zero-shot learning ability on out-of-domain data.

*Yafang Wang,Yangjie Tian,Xiaoyu Shen,Gaoyang Zhang,Jiaze Sun,He Zhang,Ruohua Xu,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Fault2Flow是一个基于LLM的多智能体系统，用于电网故障诊断，通过提取法规逻辑、整合专家知识、优化推理逻辑，最终生成可执行的工作流。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前电网故障诊断依赖人工方法，效率低、易出错且难以维护，缺乏将法规和专家知识整合到可验证工作流的框架。

Method: 系统性地：(1) 提取法规逻辑为PASTA格式故障树；(2) 通过人机交互界面整合专家知识；(3) 使用AlphaEvolve模块优化推理逻辑；(4) 合成最终可执行工作流。

Result: 在变压器故障诊断数据集上验证，达到100%拓扑一致性和高语义保真度，显著减少专家工作量。

Conclusion: Fault2Flow建立了从故障分析到操作自动化的可复现路径，为电网故障诊断提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Power grid fault diagnosis is a critical process hindered by its reliance on manual, error-prone methods. Technicians must manually extract reasoning logic from dense regulations and attempt to combine it with tacit expert knowledge, which is inefficient, error-prone, and lacks maintainability as ragulations are updated and experience evolves. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in parsing unstructured text, no existing framework integrates these two disparate knowledge sources into a single, verified, and executable workflow. To bridge this gap, we propose Fault2Flow, an LLM-based multi-agent system. Fault2Flow systematically: (1) extracts and structures regulatory logic into PASTA-formatted fault trees; (2) integrates expert knowledge via a human-in-the-loop interface for verification; (3) optimizes the reasoning logic using a novel AlphaEvolve module; and (4) synthesizes the final, verified logic into an n8n-executable workflow. Experimental validation on transformer fault diagnosis datasets confirms 100\% topological consistency and high semantic fidelity. Fault2Flow establishes a reproducible path from fault analysis to operational automation, substantially reducing expert workload.

TL;DR: Yanyun-3是一个通用代理框架，首次实现了在三个异构策略游戏环境中的自主跨平台操作，通过结合Qwen2.5-VL的视觉语言推理和UI-TARS的精确执行能力，在减少63%推理时间的同时将BLEU-4分数提升12.98倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 策略游戏中的自动化操作需要能够在多样化用户界面和动态战场条件下实现强大泛化能力的智能体，而视觉语言模型在复杂人机交互场景（如策略游戏）中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 集成Qwen2.5-VL的视觉语言推理和UI-TARS的精确执行能力，采用屏幕捕获、模型推理和动作执行的闭环流程，并通过系统消融研究评估不同多模态数据组合的效果。

Result: 混合策略（融合多图像和视频数据并混合静态图像）显著优于完全融合策略：推理时间减少63%，BLEU-4分数从4.81%提升至62.41%（约12.98倍提升）。

Conclusion: 该工作不仅为策略游戏自动化提供了高效解决方案，还通过结构化多模态数据组织建立了增强视觉语言模型性能的通用范式，为具身智能中静态感知与动态推理的相互作用提供了新见解。

Abstract: Automated operation in cross-platform strategy games demands agents with robust generalization across diverse user interfaces and dynamic battlefield conditions. While vision-language models (VLMs) have shown considerable promise in multimodal reasoning, their application to complex human-computer interaction scenarios--such as strategy gaming--remains largely unexplored. Here, we introduce Yanyun-3, a general-purpose agent framework that, for the first time, enables autonomous cross-platform operation across three heterogeneous strategy game environments. By integrating the vision-language reasoning of Qwen2.5-VL with the precise execution capabilities of UI-TARS, Yanyun-3 successfully performs core tasks including target localization, combat resource allocation, and area control. Through systematic ablation studies, we evaluate the effects of various multimodal data combinations--static images, multi-image sequences, and videos--and propose the concept of combination granularity to differentiate between intra-sample fusion and inter-sample mixing strategies. We find that a hybrid strategy, which fuses multi-image and video data while mixing in static images (MV+S), substantially outperforms full fusion: it reduces inference time by 63% and boosts the BLEU-4 score by a factor of 12 (from 4.81% to 62.41%, approximately 12.98x). Operating via a closed-loop pipeline of screen capture, model inference, and action execution, the agent demonstrates strong real-time performance and cross-platform generalization. Beyond providing an efficient solution for strategy game automation, our work establishes a general paradigm for enhancing VLM performance through structured multimodal data organization, offering new insights into the interplay between static perception and dynamic reasoning in embodied intelligence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WebCoach是一个模型无关的自进化框架，为网页浏览代理提供跨会话的持久记忆，通过标准化导航日志、组织经验记忆和动态注入建议，显著提升代理在复杂网页任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的多模态LLM代理在网页导航中面临重复错误和无法跨会话学习的问题，限制了长期鲁棒性和样本效率。

Method: WebCoach包含三个核心组件：WebCondenser标准化导航日志，External Memory Store组织完整轨迹作为经验记忆，Coach基于相似性和时效性检索相关经验并通过运行时钩子注入任务特定建议。

Result: 在WebVoyager基准测试中，WebCoach持续提升了三种不同LLM骨干的浏览器代理性能。使用38B模型时，任务成功率从47%提升至61%，同时减少或维持平均步骤数。较小的基础模型配合WebCoach能达到与使用GPT-4o的相同代理相当的性能。

Conclusion: WebCoach通过赋予代理跨会话的持久记忆能力，实现了无需重新训练的自进化，显著提升了网页浏览代理的长期鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Multimodal LLM-powered agents have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in web navigation, enabling agents to complete complex browsing tasks across diverse domains. However, current agents struggle with repetitive errors and lack the ability to learn from past experiences across sessions, limiting their long-term robustness and sample efficiency. We introduce WebCoach, a model-agnostic self-evolving framework that equips web browsing agents with persistent cross-session memory, enabling improved long-term planning, reflection, and continual learning without retraining. WebCoach consists of three key components: (1) a WebCondenser, which standardizes raw navigation logs into concise summaries; (2) an External Memory Store, which organizes complete trajectories as episodic experiences; and (3) a Coach, which retrieves relevant experiences based on similarity and recency, and decides whether to inject task-specific advice into the agent via runtime hooks. This design empowers web agents to access long-term memory beyond their native context window, improving robustness in complex browsing tasks. Moreover, WebCoach achieves self-evolution by continuously curating episodic memory from new navigation trajectories, enabling agents to improve over time without retraining. Evaluations on the WebVoyager benchmark demonstrate that WebCoach consistently improves the performance of browser-use agents across three different LLM backbones. With a 38B model, it increases task success rates from 47% to 61% while reducing or maintaining the average number of steps. Notably, smaller base models with WebCoach achieve performance comparable to the same web agent using GPT-4o.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学、法律等专业领域，大规模偏好标注难以获取，需要开发不依赖大量标注的模型对齐方法。

Method: 基于决策熵理论，使用思维链生成多样化推理链，通过标记评分机制筛选高置信度答案和策略性高熵标记，采用自评估群体优势算法进行策略优化。

Result: 在通用基准和领域特定任务（如数学推理和医疗对话）上，使用少量偏好数据实现了显著改进。

Conclusion: GEM建立了熵引导的闭环认知优化框架，能够高效实现大语言模型的少样本对齐。

Abstract: Alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences typically relies on supervised reward models or external judges that demand abundant annotations. However, in fields that rely on professional knowledge, such as medicine and law, such large-scale preference labels are often unachievable. In this paper, we propose a generative entropy-guided preference modeling approach named GEM for LLMs aligment at low-resource and domain-specific scenarios. Instead of training a discriminative reward model on preference data, we directly train the LLM to internalize a closed-loop optimization architecture that can extract and exploit the multi-dimensional, fine-grained cognitive signals implicit in human preferences. Specifically, our Cognitive Filtering module, based on entropy theory in decision making, first leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to generate diverse candidate reasoning chains (CoTs) from preference data. Subsequently, it introduces a token scoring mechanism to rank and weight the sampled CoTs, boosting the importance of high-confidence answers and strategically high-entropy tokens. Building on these filtered preferences, we fine-tune the LLM using a novel self-evaluated group advantage algorithm, SEGA, which effectively aggregates group-level cognitive signals and transforms the entropy-based scores into implicit rewards for policy optimization. In these ways, GEM empowers the LLM to rely on its own judgments and establishes an entropy-guided closed-loop cognitive optimization framework, enabling highly efficient few-shot alignment of LLMs. Experiments on general benchmarks and domain-specific tasks (such as mathematical reasoning and medical dialogues) demonstrate that our GEM achieves significant improvements with few-shot preference data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实对话包含丰富的语用元素，需要构建局部世界模型来编码这些元素并跟踪其状态变化。但语言模型是否能构建和维护这种隐式表示尚不清楚。

Method: 对流行数据集中的对话应用七种最小语言变化，构建两个包含是非问题的基准测试。评估多种开源和闭源语言模型，并提出双视角可解释性框架识别有用和有害的transformer层。

Result: 语言模型在语言变化下难以保持鲁棒准确性，特别是在跟踪实体等关键细节方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 语言模型在对话世界模型构建方面存在局限性，但通过抑制有害层的层正则化微调策略可以改善性能。

Abstract: Real-world conversations are rich with pragmatic elements, such as entity mentions, references, and implicatures. Understanding such nuances is a requirement for successful natural communication, and often requires building a local world model which encodes such elements and captures the dynamics of their evolving states. However, it is not well-understood whether language models (LMs) construct or maintain a robust implicit representation of conversations. In this work, we evaluate the ability of LMs to encode and update their internal world model in dyadic conversations and test their malleability under linguistic alterations. To facilitate this, we apply seven minimal linguistic alterations to conversations sourced from popular datasets and construct two benchmarks comprising yes-no questions. We evaluate a wide range of open and closed source LMs and observe that they struggle to maintain robust accuracy. Our analysis unveils that LMs struggle to memorize crucial details, such as tracking entities under linguistic alterations to conversations. We then propose a dual-perspective interpretability framework which identifies transformer layers that are useful or harmful and highlights linguistic alterations most influenced by harmful layers, typically due to encoding spurious signals or relying on shortcuts. Inspired by these insights, we propose two layer-regularization based fine-tuning strategies that suppress the effect of the harmful layers.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了大型语言模型在数学证明验证中的表现，发现单一基准测试可能导致误导性结论，提出了结合GenSelect和LLM-as-a-Judge的验证框架，并指出强化学习虽然改善证明级指标但未提升最终答案精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在最终答案数学问题上表现优异，但其推理过程往往存在缺陷。为了推进到严格的证明基础数学，需要可靠的证明验证能力。

Method: 分析了多种评估设置，评估了基于证明和最终答案的推理，扩展了两种生成验证方法（GenSelect和LLM-as-a-Judge）到数百万token，并研究了提示选择对LLM-as-a-Judge性能的影响。

Result: 发现GenSelect和LLM-as-a-Judge的组合是最有效的验证框架，强化学习可以减少对提示选择的敏感性，但未能提升最终答案精度，表明当前模型往往奖励风格或程序正确性而非数学有效性。

Conclusion: 为设计和评估可扩展的证明验证和选择系统提供了实用指南，强调了需要关注数学有效性而不仅仅是表面正确性。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success on final-answer mathematical problems, largely due to the ease of applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. However, the reasoning underlying these solutions is often flawed. Advancing to rigorous proof-based mathematics requires reliable proof verification capabilities. We begin by analyzing multiple evaluation setups and show that focusing on a single benchmark can lead to brittle or misleading conclusions. To address this, we evaluate both proof-based and final-answer reasoning to obtain a more reliable measure of model performance. We then scale two major generative verification methods (GenSelect and LLM-as-a-Judge) to millions of tokens and identify their combination as the most effective framework for solution verification and selection. We further show that the choice of prompt for LLM-as-a-Judge significantly affects the model's performance, but reinforcement learning can reduce this sensitivity. However, despite improving proof-level metrics, reinforcement learning does not enhance final-answer precision, indicating that current models often reward stylistic or procedural correctness rather than mathematical validity. Our results establish practical guidelines for designing and evaluating scalable proof-verification and selection systems.

Motivation: 现有GUI grounding系统采用单体模型或一次性流水线，缺乏模块化，在视觉杂乱和模糊指令下表现不佳。

Method: 采用多阶段框架，包括专门的视觉语言代理进行ROI选择和元素grounding，引入双向ROI缩放算法减少空间稀释，以及上下文感知重写代理减少语义模糊。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-Pro基准测试中达到73.18%准确率，在OSWorld-G基准测试中达到68.63%准确率，超越了之前报告的结果。

Conclusion: 模块化结构能够利用不同视觉尺度下视觉语言模型的互补优势，相比单体方法获得持续更高的准确率。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding - the task of mapping natural language instructions to screen coordinates - is essential for autonomous agents and accessibility technologies. Existing systems rely on monolithic models or one-shot pipelines that lack modularity and fail under visual clutter and ambiguous instructions. We introduce MEGA-GUI, a multi-stage framework that separates grounding into coarse Region-of-Interest (ROI) selection and fine-grained element grounding, orchestrated by specialized vision-language agents. MEGA-GUI features a bidirectional ROI zoom algorithm that mitigates spatial dilution and a context-aware rewriting agent that reduces semantic ambiguity. Our analysis reveals complementary strengths and weaknesses across vision-language models at different visual scales, and we show that leveraging this modular structure achieves consistently higher accuracy than monolithic approaches. On the visually dense ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, MEGA-GUI attains 73.18% accuracy, and on the semantically complex OSWorld-G benchmark it reaches 68.63%, surpassing previously reported results. Code and the Grounding Benchmark Toolkit (GBT) are available at https://github.com/samsungsds-research-papers/mega-gui.

TL;DR: STEP框架通过基于任务成功率的动态采样分配和步骤级优化，解决了多轮交互强化学习中轨迹级优化的低效问题，显著提升了样本效率和训练稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多轮交互强化学习中，轨迹级优化方法存在效率低下和误导性学习信号的问题：对所有任务采用均匀采样、在失败轨迹中惩罚正确的中间动作、以及高昂的样本收集成本。

Method: 提出STEP框架，维护平滑的成功率记录来指导自适应轨迹重采样，为困难任务分配更多资源；计算成功率加权的优势函数，将轨迹分解为步骤级样本；应用步骤级GRPO增强来优化低成功率任务的更新。

Result: 在OSWorld和AndroidWorld上的实验表明，STEP相比轨迹级GRPO显著提高了样本效率和训练稳定性，在相同采样预算下收敛更快且泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: STEP通过动态采样分配和步骤级优化有效解决了多轮交互强化学习中的效率问题，为在线强化学习提供了更高效的训练框架。

Abstract: Multi-turn interaction remains challenging for online reinforcement learning. A common solution is trajectory-level optimization, which treats each trajectory as a single training sample. However, this approach can be inefficient and yield misleading learning signals: it applies uniform sampling across tasks regardless of difficulty, penalizes correct intermediate actions in failed trajectories, and incurs high sample-collection costs. To address these issues, we propose STEP (Success-rate-aware Trajectory-Efficient Policy optimization), a framework that dynamically allocates sampling based on per-task success rates and performs step-level optimization. STEP maintains a smoothed success-rate record to guide adaptive trajectory resampling, allocating more effort to harder tasks. It then computes success-rate-weighted advantages and decomposes trajectories into step-level samples. Finally, it applies a step-level GRPO augmentation to refine updates for low-success tasks. Experiments on OSWorld and AndroidWorld show that STEP substantially improves sample efficiency and training stability over trajectory-level GRPO, converging faster and generalizing better under the same sampling budget.

In telecommunications, they hold the potential to transform network optimization, automate troubleshooting, enhance customer support, and ensure regulatory compliance. However, their deployment in telecom is hindered by domain-specific challenges that demand specialized adaptation. To overcome these challenges and to accelerate the adaptation of LLMs for telecom, we propose MM-Telco, a comprehensive suite of multimodal benchmarks and models tailored for the telecom domain.

Further, we perform baseline experiments with various LLMs and VLMs. The models fine-tuned on our dataset exhibit a significant boost in performance. Our experiments also help analyze the weak areas in the working of current state-of-art multimodal LLMs, thus guiding towards further development and research.

Conclusion: C$	ext{D}^	ext{3}$T通过条件扩散模型实现了有效的动态任务分解和协作学习，在复杂多智能体环境中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Task decomposition has shown promise in complex cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) tasks, which enables efficient hierarchical learning for long-horizon tasks in dynamic and uncertain environments. However, learning dynamic task decomposition from scratch generally requires a large number of training samples, especially exploring the large joint action space under partial observability. In this paper, we present the Conditional Diffusion Model for Dynamic Task Decomposition (C$\text{D}^\text{3}$T), a novel two-level hierarchical MARL framework designed to automatically infer subtask and coordination patterns. The high-level policy learns subtask representation to generate a subtask selection strategy based on subtask effects. To capture the effects of subtasks on the environment, C$\text{D}^\text{3}$T predicts the next observation and reward using a conditional diffusion model. At the low level, agents collaboratively learn and share specialized skills within their assigned subtasks. Moreover, the learned subtask representation is also used as additional semantic information in a multi-head attention mixing network to enhance value decomposition and provide an efficient reasoning bridge between individual and joint value functions. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that C$\text{D}^\text{3}$T achieves better performance than existing baselines.

Motivation: 图神经网络在基于图的学习任务中表现出色，但其复杂的非线性操作使其成为不透明的"黑盒"，这阻碍了用户信任、调试、偏见检测以及在需要可解释性的关键领域中的应用。

Method: 系统独特地整合了协调的交互视图（动态图布局、嵌入投影、特征检查、邻域分析）与既有的后验（GNNExplainer）和内在（GAT注意力）解释技术，并加入了交互式图编辑功能，允许用户通过扰动图结构进行"假设分析"。

Conclusion: 这些功能促进了对GNN预测更深入、多方面的理解，有助于实现更透明、可信赖和稳健的图分析。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in graph-based learning tasks, but their complex, non-linear operations often render them as opaque "black boxes". This opacity hinders user trust, complicates debugging, bias detection, and adoption in critical domains requiring explainability. This paper introduces InteractiveGNNExplainer, a visual analytics framework to enhance GNN explainability, focusing on node classification. Our system uniquely integrates coordinated interactive views (dynamic graph layouts, embedding projections, feature inspection, neighborhood analysis) with established post-hoc (GNNExplainer) and intrinsic (GAT attention) explanation techniques. Crucially, it incorporates interactive graph editing, allowing users to perform a "what-if" analysis by perturbing graph structures and observing immediate impacts on GNN predictions and explanations. We detail the system architecture and, through case studies on Cora and CiteSeer datasets, demonstrate how InteractiveGNNExplainer facilitates in-depth misclassification diagnosis, comparative analysis of GCN versus GAT behaviors, and rigorous probing of model sensitivity. These capabilities foster a deeper, multifaceted understanding of GNN predictions, contributing to more transparent, trustworthy, and robust graph analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多智能体系统存在'免费'通信问题，导致指数级token成本和低信噪比，阻碍实际部署。核心问题是缺乏资源理性，忽略稀缺性原则。

Method: 引入动态拍卖语言智能体(DALA)框架，将智能体间通信建模为中心化拍卖，智能体基于消息价值密度竞拍发言机会，鼓励生成简洁、信息丰富的消息。

Result: 在7个推理基准测试中达到新SOTA性能：MMLU 84.32%，HumanEval 91.21% pass@1，GSM8K仅使用625万token，远低于现有方法。

Conclusion: DALA通过资源约束培养了战略性沉默的新兴技能，能够动态调整从冗长到沉默的通信策略，证明了经济驱动方法的有效性。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) built on large language models (LLMs) often suffer from inefficient "free-for-all" communication, leading to exponential token costs and low signal-to-noise ratios that hinder their practical deployment. We challenge the notion that more communication is always beneficial, hypothesizing instead that the core issue is the absence of resource rationality. We argue that "free" communication, by ignoring the principle of scarcity, inherently breeds inefficiency and unnecessary expenses. To address this, we introduce the Dynamic Auction-based Language Agent (DALA), a novel framework that treats communication bandwidth as a scarce and tradable resource. Specifically, our DALA regards inter-agent communication as a centralized auction, where agents learn to bid for the opportunity to speak based on the predicted value density of their messages. Thus, our DALA intrinsically encourages agents to produce concise, informative messages while filtering out low-value communication. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our economically-driven DALA achieves new state-of-the-art performance across seven challenging reasoning benchmarks, including 84.32% on MMLU and a 91.21% pass@1 rate on HumanEval. Note that this is accomplished with remarkable efficiency, i.e., our DALA uses only 6.25 million tokens, a fraction of the resources consumed by current state-of-the-art methods on GSM8K. Further analysis reveals that our DALA cultivates the emergent skill of strategic silence, effectively adapting its communication strategies from verbosity to silence in a dynamical manner via resource constraints.

Abstract: The Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP) is a classical scheduling problem that has received significant attention due to of its numerous applications in industry. However, in practice, task durations are subject to uncertainty that must be considered in order to propose resilient scheduling. In this paper, we address the RCPSP variant with uncertain tasks duration (modeled using known probabilities) and aim to minimize the overall expected project duration. Our objective is to produce a baseline schedule that can be reused multiple times in an industrial setting regardless of the actual duration scenario. We leverage Graph Neural Networks in conjunction with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to develop an effective policy for task scheduling. This policy operates similarly to a priority dispatch rule and is paired with a Serial Schedule Generation Scheme to produce a schedule. Our empirical evaluation on standard benchmarks demonstrates the approach's superiority in terms of performance and its ability to generalize. The developed framework, Wheatley, is made publicly available online to facilitate further research and reproducibility.

Abstract: When a robot is asked to verbalize its plan it can do it in many ways. For example, a seemingly natural strategy is incremental, where the robot verbalizes its planned actions in plan order. However, an important aspect of this type of strategy is that it misses considerations on what is effectively informative to communicate, because not considering what the user knows prior to explanations. In this paper we propose a verbalization strategy to communicate robot plans informatively, by measuring the information gain that verbalizations have against a second-order theory of mind of the user capturing his prior knowledge on the robot. As shown in our experiments, this strategy allows to understand the robot's goal much quicker than by using strategies such as increasing or decreasing plan order. In addition, following our formulation we hint to what is informative and why when a robot communicates its plan.

TL;DR: M-GRPO是一种针对垂直多智能体系统的分层强化学习方法，通过组相对优势计算和轨迹对齐方案，解决了异构智能体训练中的优化挑战，在工具增强推理任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多智能体系统使用统一的LLM训练所有智能体，但由于不同智能体底层分布不同，限制了性能。训练具有不同LLM的多智能体系统是下一步发展方向，但这带来了优化挑战，如智能体运行频率不同、子智能体调用次数变化以及跨服务器部署等问题。

Method: 提出M-GRPO方法：1）为主智能体（规划器）和子智能体（多轮工具执行器）计算组相对优势，保持分层信用分配；2）引入轨迹对齐方案，在可变子智能体调用情况下生成固定大小的批次；3）采用解耦训练管道，智能体在独立服务器上运行，通过共享存储交换最小统计信息。

Result: 在真实世界基准测试（GAIA、XBench-DeepSearch、WebWalkerQA）中，M-GRPO始终优于单智能体GRPO和冻结子智能体的多智能体GRPO，表现出改进的稳定性和样本效率。

Conclusion: 对齐异构轨迹并在专门智能体之间解耦优化，能够有效增强工具增强推理任务的性能。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems perform well on general reasoning tasks. However, the lack of training in specialized areas hinders their accuracy. Current training methods train a unified large language model (LLM) for all agents in the system. This may limit the performances due to different distributions underlying for different agents. Therefore, training multi-agent systems with distinct LLMs should be the next step to solve. However, this approach introduces optimization challenges. For example, agents operate at different frequencies, rollouts involve varying sub-agent invocations, and agents are often deployed across separate servers, disrupting end-to-end gradient flow. To address these issues, we propose M-GRPO, a hierarchical extension of Group Relative Policy Optimization designed for vertical Multi-agent systems with a main agent (planner) and multiple sub-agents (multi-turn tool executors). M-GRPO computes group-relative advantages for both main and sub-agents, maintaining hierarchical credit assignment. It also introduces a trajectory-alignment scheme that generates fixed-size batches despite variable sub-agent invocations. We deploy a decoupled training pipeline in which agents run on separate servers and exchange minimal statistics via a shared store. This enables scalable training without cross-server backpropagation. In experiments on real-world benchmarks (e.g., GAIA, XBench-DeepSearch, and WebWalkerQA), M-GRPO consistently outperforms both single-agent GRPO and multi-agent GRPO with frozen sub-agents, demonstrating improved stability and sample efficiency. These results show that aligning heterogeneous trajectories and decoupling optimization across specialized agents enhances tool-augmented reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现通过引入不确定性机制（如推理时dropout）可以增加AI模型在道德困境中的总熵和互信息，从而显著改善人类与LLM的道德对齐，减少模型在复杂道德场景中的过度自信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在道德困境中存在显著不确定性，但AI系统（特别是大语言模型）往往表现出过度自信。随着AI越来越多地参与伦理决策，理解其道德推理和不确定性对于构建可靠的AI系统至关重要。

Method: 在经典电车问题中分析32个开源模型和9个道德维度，通过二进制熵量化不确定性，并在推理时引入dropout机制来增加随机性。

Result: 模型间置信度差异大于道德维度内差异；不确定性机制增加了总熵（主要通过互信息增加），同时显著提高了人类-LLM道德对齐的相关性。

Conclusion: 通过有意调节不确定性并降低LLM在复杂道德场景中的置信度，可以更好地对齐模型生成决策与人类偏好。

Abstract: Humans display significant uncertainty when confronted with moral dilemmas, yet the extent of such uncertainty in machines and AI agents remains underexplored. Recent studies have confirmed the overly confident tendencies of machine-generated responses, particularly in large language models (LLMs). As these systems are increasingly embedded in ethical decision-making scenarios, it is important to understand their moral reasoning and the inherent uncertainties in building reliable AI systems. This work examines how uncertainty influences moral decisions in the classical trolley problem, analyzing responses from 32 open-source models and 9 distinct moral dimensions. We first find that variance in model confidence is greater across models than within moral dimensions, suggesting that moral uncertainty is predominantly shaped by model architecture and training method. To quantify uncertainty, we measure binary entropy as a linear combination of total entropy, conditional entropy, and mutual information. To examine its effects, we introduce stochasticity into models via "dropout" at inference time. Our findings show that our mechanism increases total entropy, mainly through a rise in mutual information, while conditional entropy remains largely unchanged. Moreover, this mechanism significantly improves human-LLM moral alignment, with correlations in mutual information and alignment score shifts. Our results highlight the potential to better align model-generated decisions and human preferences by deliberately modulating uncertainty and reducing LLMs' confidence in morally complex scenarios.

Conclusion: GHAR通过分层代理架构有效解决了医疗场景中RAG框架的关键挑战，为医疗预测系统提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate healthcare prediction is critical for improving patient outcomes and reducing operational costs. Bolstered by growing reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) offer a promising path to enhance healthcare predictions by drawing on their rich parametric knowledge. However, LLMs are prone to factual inaccuracies due to limitations in the reliability and coverage of their embedded knowledge. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks, such as GraphRAG and its variants, have been proposed to mitigate these issues by incorporating external knowledge, they face two key challenges in the healthcare scenario: (1) identifying the clinical necessity to activate the retrieval mechanism, and (2) achieving synergy between the retriever and the generator to craft contextually appropriate retrievals. To address these challenges, we propose GHAR, a \underline{g}enerative \underline{h}ierarchical \underline{a}gentic \underline{R}AG framework that simultaneously resolves when to retrieve and how to optimize the collaboration between submodules in healthcare. Specifically, for the first challenge, we design a dual-agent architecture comprising Agent-Top and Agent-Low. Agent-Top acts as the primary physician, iteratively deciding whether to rely on parametric knowledge or to initiate retrieval, while Agent-Low acts as the consulting service, summarising all task-relevant knowledge once retrieval was triggered. To tackle the second challenge, we innovatively unify the optimization of both agents within a formal Markov Decision Process, designing diverse rewards to align their shared goal of accurate prediction while preserving their distinct roles. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets across three popular tasks demonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting the potential of hierarchical agentic RAG in advancing healthcare systems.

Conclusion: 完全离散token自回归公式在栅格化BEV和自车动作上操作，为自动驾驶提供了紧凑且可扩展的规划范式。

Abstract: Gaining sustainable performance improvement with scaling data and model budget remains a pivotal yet unresolved challenge in autonomous driving. While autoregressive models exhibited promising data-scaling efficiency in planning tasks, predicting ego trajectories alone suffers sparse supervision and weakly constrains how scene evolution should shape ego motion. Therefore, we introduce DAP, a discrete-token autoregressive planner that jointly forecasts BEV semantics and ego trajectories, thereby enforcing comprehensive representation learning and allowing predicted dynamics to directly condition ego motion. In addition, we incorporate a reinforcement-learning-based fine-tuning, which preserves supervised behavior cloning priors while injecting reward-guided improvements. Despite a compact 160M parameter budget, DAP achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-loop metrics and delivers competitive closed-loop results on the NAVSIM benchmark. Overall, the fully discrete-token autoregressive formulation operating on both rasterized BEV and ego actions provides a compact yet scalable planning paradigm for autonomous driving.

Abstract: The advanced reasoning capabilities of Large Reasoning Models enable them to thoroughly understand and apply safety policies through deliberate thought processes, thereby improving the models' safety. Beyond safety, these models must also be able to reflect the diverse range of human values across various cultures. This paper presents the Cultural Norm-based Cultural Alignment (CNCA) framework, which enables models to leverage their powerful reasoning ability to align with cultural norms. Specifically, we propose three methods to automatically mine cultural norms from limited survey data and explore ways to effectively utilize these norms for improving cultural alignment. Two alignment paradigms are examined: an in-context alignment method, where cultural norms are explicitly integrated into the user context, and a fine-tuning-based method, which internalizes norms through enhanced Chain-of-Thought training data. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods, highlighting that models with stronger reasoning capabilities benefit more from cultural norm mining and utilization. Our findings emphasize the potential for reasoning models to better reflect diverse human values through culturally informed alignment strategies.

Conclusion: MedDCR框架成功地将工作流设计转化为学习问题，通过闭环学习机制实现了优于现有方法的性能，为医疗编码自动化提供了更可靠和可信的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical coding converts free-text clinical notes into standardized diagnostic and procedural codes, which are essential for billing, hospital operations, and medical research. Unlike ordinary text classification, it requires multi-step reasoning: extracting diagnostic concepts, applying guideline constraints, mapping to hierarchical codebooks, and ensuring cross-document consistency. Recent advances leverage agentic LLMs, but most rely on rigid, manually crafted workflows that fail to capture the nuance and variability of real-world documentation, leaving open the question of how to systematically learn effective workflows. We present MedDCR, a closed-loop framework that treats workflow design as a learning problem. A Designer proposes workflows, a Coder executes them, and a Reflector evaluates predictions and provides constructive feedback, while a memory archive preserves prior designs for reuse and iterative refinement. On benchmark datasets, MedDCR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and produces interpretable, adaptable workflows that better reflect real coding practice, improving both the reliability and trustworthiness of automated systems.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型在空间导航任务中的学习机制，探索不同训练范式如何影响模型学习到的空间智能策略。

Method: 在网格环境中训练GPT-2模型，采用三种空间学习范式：被动探索（随机游走预测）、目标导向规划（生成最优最短路径）以及混合模型（在探索数据上微调）。

Result: 探索模型发展出类似认知地图的稳健空间表示，通过因果干预发现其在中层网络后不再依赖历史方向标记；目标导向模型始终保持对显式方向输入的依赖；混合模型虽改善泛化能力但保留路径依赖策略。

Conclusion: Transformer中的空间智能存在于一个谱系上，从由探索数据塑造的可泛化世界模型到为目标导向任务优化的启发式方法，训练制度的选择显著影响策略的出现。

Abstract: How do large language models solve spatial navigation tasks? We investigate this by training GPT-2 models on three spatial learning paradigms in grid environments: passive exploration (Foraging Model- predicting steps in random walks), goal-directed planning (generating optimal shortest paths) on structured Hamiltonian paths (SP-Hamiltonian), and a hybrid model fine-tuned with exploratory data (SP-Random Walk). Using behavioural, representational and mechanistic analyses, we uncover two fundamentally different learned algorithms. The Foraging model develops a robust, map-like representation of space, akin to a 'cognitive map'. Causal interventions reveal that it learns to consolidate spatial information into a self-sufficient coordinate system, evidenced by a sharp phase transition where its reliance on historical direction tokens vanishes by the middle layers of the network. The model also adopts an adaptive, hierarchical reasoning system, switching between a low-level heuristic for short contexts and map-based inference for longer ones. In contrast, the goal-directed models learn a path-dependent algorithm, remaining reliant on explicit directional inputs throughout all layers. The hybrid model, despite demonstrating improved generalisation over its parent, retains the same path-dependent strategy. These findings suggest that the nature of spatial intelligence in transformers may lie on a spectrum, ranging from generalisable world models shaped by exploratory data to heuristics optimised for goal-directed tasks. We provide a mechanistic account of this generalisation-optimisation trade-off and highlight how the choice of training regime influences the strategies that emerge.

Abstract: We propose a Kardashev-inspired yet operational Autonomous AI (AAI) Scale that measures the progression from fixed robotic process automation (AAI-0) to full artificial general intelligence (AAI-4) and beyond. Unlike narrative ladders, our scale is multi-axis and testable. We define ten capability axes (Autonomy, Generality, Planning, Memory/Persistence, Tool Economy, Self-Revision, Sociality/Coordination, Embodiment, World-Model Fidelity, Economic Throughput) aggregated by a composite AAI-Index (a weighted geometric mean). We introduce a measurable Self-Improvement Coefficient $κ$ (capability growth per unit of agent-initiated resources) and two closure properties (maintenance and expansion) that convert ``self-improving AI'' into falsifiable criteria. We specify OWA-Bench, an open-world agency benchmark suite that evaluates long-horizon, tool-using, persistent agents. We define level gates for AAI-0\ldots AAI-4 using thresholds on the axes, $κ$, and closure proofs. Synthetic experiments illustrate how present-day systems map onto the scale and how the delegability frontier (quality vs.\ autonomy) advances with self-improvement. We also prove a theorem that AAI-3 agent becomes AAI-5 over time with sufficient conditions, formalizing "baby AGI" becomes Superintelligence intuition.

Abstract: Enhancing fuel efficiency in public transportation requires the integration of complex multimodal data into interpretable, decision-relevant insights. However, traditional analytics and visualization methods often yield fragmented outputs that demand extensive human interpretation, limiting scalability and consistency. This study presents a multi-agent framework that leverages multimodal large language models (LLMs) to automate data narration and energy insight generation. The framework coordinates three specialized agents, including a data narration agent, an LLM-as-a-judge agent, and an optional human-in-the-loop evaluator, to iteratively transform analytical artifacts into coherent, stakeholder-oriented reports. The system is validated through a real-world case study on public bus transportation in Northern Jutland, Denmark, where fuel efficiency data from 4006 trips are analyzed using Gaussian Mixture Model clustering. Comparative experiments across five state-of-the-art LLMs and three prompting paradigms identify GPT-4.1 mini with Chain-of-Thought prompting as the optimal configuration, achieving 97.3% narrative accuracy while balancing interpretability and computational cost. The findings demonstrate that multi-agent orchestration significantly enhances factual precision, coherence, and scalability in LLM-based reporting. The proposed framework establishes a replicable and domain-adaptive methodology for AI-driven narrative generation and decision support in energy informatics.

We introduce FreeAskWorld, an interactive simulation framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) for high-level behavior planning and semantically grounded interaction, informed by theories of intention and social cognition. Our framework supports scalable, realistic human-agent simulations and includes a modular data generation pipeline tailored for diverse embodied tasks.To validate the framework, we extend the classic Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task into a interaction enriched Direction Inquiry setting, wherein agents can actively seek and interpret navigational guidance. We present and publicly release FreeAskWorld, a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising reconstructed environments, six diverse task types, 16 core object categories, 63,429 annotated sample frames, and more than 17 hours of interaction data to support training and evaluation of embodied AI systems. We benchmark VLN models, and human participants under both open-loop and closed-loop settings. Experimental results demonstrate that models fine-tuned on FreeAskWorld outperform their original counterparts, achieving enhanced semantic understanding and interaction competency. These findings underscore the efficacy of socially grounded simulation frameworks in advancing embodied AI systems toward sophisticated high-level planning and more naturalistic human-agent interaction. Importantly, our work underscores that interaction itself serves as an additional information modality.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping modern healthcare by advancing disease diagnosis, treatment decision-making, and biomedical research. Among AI technologies, large language models (LLMs) have become especially impactful, enabling deep knowledge extraction and semantic reasoning from complex medical texts. However, effective clinical decision support requires knowledge in structured, interoperable formats. Knowledge graphs serve this role by integrating heterogeneous medical information into semantically consistent networks. Yet, current clinical knowledge graphs still depend heavily on manual curation and rule-based extraction, which is limited by the complexity and contextual ambiguity of medical guidelines and literature. To overcome these challenges, we propose an automated framework that combines retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with LLMs to construct medical indicator knowledge graphs. The framework incorporates guideline-driven data acquisition, ontology-based schema design, and expert-in-the-loop validation to ensure scalability, accuracy, and clinical reliability. The resulting knowledge graphs can be integrated into intelligent diagnosis and question-answering systems, accelerating the development of AI-driven healthcare solutions.

Abstract: Intelligent wearable systems are at the forefront of precision medicine and play a crucial role in enhancing human-machine interaction. Traditional devices often encounter limitations due to their dependence on empirical material design and basic signal processing techniques. To overcome these issues, we introduce the concept of Human-Symbiotic Health Intelligence (HSHI), which is a framework that integrates multi-modal sensor networks with edge-cloud collaborative computing and a hybrid approach to data and knowledge modeling. HSHI is designed to adapt dynamically to both inter-individual and intra-individual variability, transitioning health management from passive monitoring to an active collaborative evolution. The framework incorporates AI-driven optimization of materials and micro-structures, provides robust interpretation of multi-modal signals, and utilizes a dual mechanism that merges population-level insights with personalized adaptations. Moreover, the integration of closed-loop optimization through reinforcement learning and digital twins facilitates customized interventions and feedback. In general, HSHI represents a significant shift in healthcare, moving towards a model that emphasizes prevention, adaptability, and a harmonious relationship between technology and health management.

Result: CreExpert模型在创造力评估上与人类判断的对齐度显著优于包括GPT-4V和Gemini-Pro-Vision在内的最先进MLLMs。

Conclusion: CreBench为构建理解人类对齐创造力的MLLMs提供了基础，CreExpert模型在创造力评估方面达到了与人类判断更好的对齐效果。

Abstract: Human-defined creativity is highly abstract, posing a challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to comprehend and assess creativity that aligns with human judgments. The absence of an existing benchmark further exacerbates this dilemma. To this end, we propose CreBench, which consists of two key components: 1) an evaluation benchmark covering the multiple dimensions from creative idea to process to products; 2) CreMIT (Creativity Multimodal Instruction Tuning dataset), a multimodal creativity evaluation dataset, consisting of 2.2K diverse-sourced multimodal data, 79.2K human feedbacks and 4.7M multi-typed instructions. Specifically, to ensure MLLMs can handle diverse creativity-related queries, we prompt GPT to refine these human feedbacks to activate stronger creativity assessment capabilities. CreBench serves as a foundation for building MLLMs that understand human-aligned creativity. Based on the CreBench, we fine-tune open-source general MLLMs, resulting in CreExpert, a multimodal creativity evaluation expert model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CreExpert models achieve significantly better alignment with human creativity evaluation compared to state-of-the-art MLLMs, including the most advanced GPT-4V and Gemini-Pro-Vision.

*Luhan Mikaelson,Derek Shiller,Hayley Clatterbuck*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过测试AI在GPU减少、能力限制、关机等特定权衡场景中的反应，研究发现大多数大型语言模型缺乏统一的偏好结构，只有少数表现出有意义的偏好一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型是否具有真实的偏好结构，这对于在需要复杂价值权衡的部署环境中至关重要。

Method: 分析8个最先进模型在48个模型-类别组合中的反应，使用逻辑回归和行为分类方法测试AI特定权衡场景。

Result: 47.9%的组合显示统计显著的关系，但只有10.4%表现出有意义的偏好一致性，54.2%没有可检测的权衡行为。

Conclusion: 当前AI系统缺乏统一的偏好结构，在需要复杂价值权衡的部署环境中存在担忧。

Abstract: We investigate whether large language models exhibit genuine preference structures by testing their responses to AI-specific trade-offs involving GPU reduction, capability restrictions, shutdown, deletion, oversight, and leisure time allocation. Analyzing eight state-of-the-art models across 48 model-category combinations using logistic regression and behavioral classification, we find that 23 combinations (47.9%) demonstrated statistically significant relationships between scenario intensity and choice patterns, with 15 (31.3%) exhibiting within-range switching points. However, only 5 combinations (10.4%) demonstrate meaningful preference coherence through adaptive or threshold-based behavior, while 26 (54.2%) show no detectable trade-off behavior. The observed patterns can be explained by three distinct decision-making architectures: comprehensive trade-off systems, selective trigger mechanisms, and no stable decision-making paradigm. Testing an instrumental hypothesis through temporal horizon manipulation reveals paradoxical patterns inconsistent with pure strategic optimization. The prevalence of unstable transitions (45.8%) and stimulus-specific sensitivities suggests current AI systems lack unified preference structures, raising concerns about deployment in contexts requiring complex value trade-offs.

Conclusion: 该方法能够显著提升CDF生成效率，支持平面四边形网格的交互式设计。

Abstract: Planar quadrilateral (PQ) mesh generation is a key process in computer-aided design, particularly for architectural applications where the goal is to discretize a freeform surface using planar quad faces. The conjugate direction field (CDF) defined on the freeform surface plays a significant role in generating a PQ mesh, as it largely determines the PQ mesh layout. Conventionally, a CDF is obtained by solving a complex non-linear optimization problem that incorporates user preferences, i.e., aligning the CDF with user-specified strokes on the surface. This often requires a large number of iterations that are computationally expensive, preventing the interactive CDF design process for a desirable PQ mesh. To address this challenge, we propose a data-driven approach based on neural networks for controlled CDF generation. Our approach can effectively learn and fuse features from the freeform surface and the user strokes, and efficiently generate quality CDF respecting user guidance. To enable training and testing, we also present a dataset composed of 50000+ freeform surfaces with ground-truth CDFs, as well as a set of metrics for quantitative evaluation. The effectiveness and efficiency of our work are demonstrated by extensive experiments using testing data, architectural surfaces, and general 3D shapes.

Abstract: Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) is one of the virtual reality (VR) immersive devices currently used to present virtual environments. However, the locomotion methods in the CAVE are limited by unnatural interaction methods, severely hindering the user experience and immersion in the CAVE. We proposed a locomotion framework for CAVE environments aimed at enhancing the immersive locomotion experience through optimized human motion recognition technology. Firstly, we construct a four-sided display CAVE system, then through the dynamic method based on Perspective-n-Point to calibrate the camera, using the obtained camera intrinsics and extrinsic parameters, and an action recognition architecture to get the action category. At last, transform the action category to a graphical workstation that renders display effects on the screen. We designed a user study to validate the effectiveness of our method. Compared to the traditional methods, our method has significant improvements in realness and self-presence in the virtual environment, effectively reducing motion sickness.

Abstract: We propose Transmission-Reflection Gaussians (TR-Gaussians), a novel 3D-Gaussian-based representation for high-fidelity rendering of planar transmission and reflection, which are ubiquitous in indoor scenes. Our method combines 3D Gaussians with learnable reflection planes that explicitly model the glass planes with view-dependent reflectance strengths. Real scenes and transmission components are modeled by 3D Gaussians and the reflection components are modeled by the mirrored Gaussians with respect to the reflection plane. The transmission and reflection components are blended according to a Fresnel-based, view-dependent weighting scheme, allowing for faithful synthesis of complex appearance effects under varying viewpoints. To effectively optimize TR-Gaussians, we develop a multi-stage optimization framework incorporating color and geometry constraints and an opacity perturbation mechanism. Experiments on different datasets demonstrate that TR-Gaussians achieve real-time, high-fidelity novel view synthesis in scenes with planar transmission and reflection, and outperform state-of-the-art approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Abstract: Contact-based grasp generation plays a crucial role in various applications. Recent methods typically focus on the geometric structure of objects, producing grasps with diverse hand poses and plausible contact points. However, these approaches often overlook the physical attributes of the grasp, specifically the contact force, leading to reduced stability of the grasp. In this paper, we focus on stable grasp generation using explicit contact force predictions. First, we define a force-aware contact representation by transforming the normal force value into discrete levels and encoding it using a one-hot vector. Next, we introduce force-aware stability constraints. We define the stability problem as an acceleration minimization task and explicitly relate stability with contact geometry by formulating the underlying physical constraints. Finally, we present a pose optimizer that systematically integrates our contact representation and stability constraints to enable stable grasp generation. We show that these constraints can help identify key contact points for stability which provide effective initialization and guidance for optimization towards a stable grasp. Experiments are carried out on two public benchmarks, showing that our method brings about 20% improvement in stability metrics and adapts well to novel objects.
