### [1] [ArtiLatent: Realistic Articulated 3D Object Generation via Structured Latents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21432)
*Honghua Chen,Yushi Lan,Yongwei Chen,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArtiLatent是一个生成框架，能够合成具有精细几何结构、准确关节连接和逼真外观的人造3D物体。它通过变分自编码器将稀疏体素表示和关节属性嵌入统一潜空间，并使用潜扩散模型进行多样化采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成关节化3D物体时难以同时保证几何一致性、准确关节和逼真外观，特别是在处理关节依赖的可见性变化方面存在不足。

Method: 联合建模部件几何和关节动态，将稀疏体素表示和关节属性嵌入统一潜空间；使用潜扩散模型进行采样；引入关节感知的高斯解码器处理关节依赖的可见性变化。

Result: 在PartNet-Mobility和ACD数据集上的实验表明，ArtiLatent在几何一致性和外观保真度方面优于现有方法，能够生成逼真的关节化3D物体。

Conclusion: 该框架为关节化3D物体合成和操作提供了可扩展的解决方案，显著提升了跨关节配置的视觉真实感。

Abstract: We propose ArtiLatent, a generative framework that synthesizes human-made 3D
objects with fine-grained geometry, accurate articulation, and realistic
appearance. Our approach jointly models part geometry and articulation dynamics
by embedding sparse voxel representations and associated articulation
properties, including joint type, axis, origin, range, and part category, into
a unified latent space via a variational autoencoder. A latent diffusion model
is then trained over this space to enable diverse yet physically plausible
sampling. To reconstruct photorealistic 3D shapes, we introduce an
articulation-aware Gaussian decoder that accounts for articulation-dependent
visibility changes (e.g., revealing the interior of a drawer when opened). By
conditioning appearance decoding on articulation state, our method assigns
plausible texture features to regions that are typically occluded in static
poses, significantly improving visual realism across articulation
configurations. Extensive experiments on furniture-like objects from
PartNet-Mobility and ACD datasets demonstrate that ArtiLatent outperforms
existing approaches in geometric consistency and appearance fidelity. Our
framework provides a scalable solution for articulated 3D object synthesis and
manipulation.

### [2] [Group Inertial Poser: Multi-Person Pose and Global Translation from Sparse Inertial Sensors and Ultra-Wideband Ranging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21654)
*Ying Xue,Jiaxi Jiang,Rayan Armani,Dominik Hollidt,Yi-Chi Liao,Christian Holz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用稀疏可穿戴IMU和UWB传感器进行多人全身运动跟踪的新方法，通过融合惯性观测和传感器间距离测量来精确估计3D姿态和全局轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于IMU的运动跟踪虽然克服了视觉方法的遮挡和环境限制，但缺乏空间参考导致平移估计和多人相对定位不准确。

Method: 使用超宽带测距技术估计传感器间绝对距离，结合惯性观测输入到结构化状态空间模型中，并采用新颖的两步优化方法跟踪全局轨迹。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据上，该方法在准确性和鲁棒性方面优于现有最先进方法，展示了IMU+UWB多人运动捕捉的潜力。

Conclusion: Group Inertial Poser方法通过融合IMU和UWB技术，为野外多人运动捕捉提供了一种准确且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Tracking human full-body motion using sparse wearable inertial measurement
units (IMUs) overcomes the limitations of occlusion and instrumentation of the
environment inherent in vision-based approaches. However, purely IMU-based
tracking compromises translation estimates and accurate relative positioning
between individuals, as inertial cues are inherently self-referential and
provide no direct spatial reference for others. In this paper, we present a
novel approach for robustly estimating body poses and global translation for
multiple individuals by leveraging the distances between sparse wearable
sensors - both on each individual and across multiple individuals. Our method
Group Inertial Poser estimates these absolute distances between pairs of
sensors from ultra-wideband ranging (UWB) and fuses them with inertial
observations as input into structured state-space models to integrate temporal
motion patterns for precise 3D pose estimation. Our novel two-step optimization
further leverages the estimated distances for accurately tracking people's
global trajectories through the world. We also introduce GIP-DB, the first
IMU+UWB dataset for two-person tracking, which comprises 200 minutes of motion
recordings from 14 participants. In our evaluation, Group Inertial Poser
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness across
synthetic and real-world data, showing the promise of IMU+UWB-based multi-human
motion capture in the wild. Code, models, dataset:

### [3] [WorldGrow: Generating Infinite 3D World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21682)
*Sikuang Li,Chen Yang,Jiemin Fang,Taoran Yi,Jia Lu,Jiazhong Cen,Lingxi Xie,Wei Shen,Qi Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WorldGrow是一个分层框架，用于无限扩展的3D场景合成，通过利用预训练3D模型的生成先验，实现几何一致且外观逼真的大规模连续环境生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在无限扩展3D世界生成中的关键挑战：2D方法存在视图间不一致性，3D隐式表示难以扩展，现有3D基础模型多为物体中心，不适用于场景级生成。

Method: 采用分层框架，包含三个核心组件：(1)数据筛选管道提取高质量场景块进行训练；(2)3D块修复机制实现上下文感知的场景扩展；(3)从粗到细的生成策略确保全局布局合理性和局部几何/纹理保真度。

Result: 在3D-FRONT数据集上评估，WorldGrow在几何重建方面达到最先进性能，同时独特支持具有照片级真实感和结构一致输出的无限场景生成。

Conclusion: WorldGrow展示了构建大规模虚拟环境的能力，并具有构建未来世界模型的潜力。

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of generating the infinitely extendable 3D world --
large, continuous environments with coherent geometry and realistic appearance.
Existing methods face key challenges: 2D-lifting approaches suffer from
geometric and appearance inconsistencies across views, 3D implicit
representations are hard to scale up, and current 3D foundation models are
mostly object-centric, limiting their applicability to scene-level generation.
Our key insight is leveraging strong generation priors from pre-trained 3D
models for structured scene block generation. To this end, we propose
WorldGrow, a hierarchical framework for unbounded 3D scene synthesis. Our
method features three core components: (1) a data curation pipeline that
extracts high-quality scene blocks for training, making the 3D structured
latent representations suitable for scene generation; (2) a 3D block inpainting
mechanism that enables context-aware scene extension; and (3) a coarse-to-fine
generation strategy that ensures both global layout plausibility and local
geometric/textural fidelity. Evaluated on the large-scale 3D-FRONT dataset,
WorldGrow achieves SOTA performance in geometry reconstruction, while uniquely
supporting infinite scene generation with photorealistic and structurally
consistent outputs. These results highlight its capability for constructing
large-scale virtual environments and potential for building future world
models.

### [4] [Preventing Shortcuts in Adapter Training via Providing the Shortcuts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20887)
*Anujraaj Argo Goyal,Guocheng Gordon Qian,Huseyin Coskun,Aarush Gupta,Himmy Tam,Daniil Ostashev,Ju Hu,Dhritiman Sagar,Sergey Tulyakov,Kfir Aberman,Kuan-Chieh Jackson Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training方法，通过在适配器训练时建立干扰因素的捷径路径，防止目标属性与偶然因素（如姿势、表情、光照）的纠缠，从而提高生成质量、多样性和提示遵循能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的适配器训练方法在捕捉特定目标属性（如身份）时，容易将目标属性与输入图像中的偶然因素（姿势、表情、光照等）纠缠在一起，这种虚假相关性问题限制了模型的泛化能力和对文本提示的遵循能力。

Method: 在适配器训练过程中，通过ControlNet或LoRA等辅助模块为干扰因素建立捷径路径，消除适配器内部化这些因素的动力，然后在推理时移除这些辅助模块。

Result: 在面部和全身身份注入等任务中，该方法提高了生成质量、多样性和提示遵循能力。

Conclusion: 在大模型时代，当寻求解耦表示时，最有效的路径可能是为不应学习的内容建立捷径。

Abstract: Adapter-based training has emerged as a key mechanism for extending the
capabilities of powerful foundation image generators, enabling personalized and
stylized text-to-image synthesis. These adapters are typically trained to
capture a specific target attribute, such as subject identity, using
single-image reconstruction objectives. However, because the input image
inevitably contains a mixture of visual factors, adapters are prone to entangle
the target attribute with incidental ones, such as pose, expression, and
lighting. This spurious correlation problem limits generalization and obstructs
the model's ability to adhere to the input text prompt. In this work, we
uncover a simple yet effective solution: provide the very shortcuts we wish to
eliminate during adapter training. In Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training,
confounding factors are routed through auxiliary modules, such as ControlNet or
LoRA, eliminating the incentive for the adapter to internalize them. The
auxiliary modules are then removed during inference. When applied to tasks like
facial and full-body identity injection, our approach improves generation
quality, diversity, and prompt adherence. These results point to a general
design principle in the era of large models: when seeking disentangled
representations, the most effective path may be to establish shortcuts for what
should NOT be learned.

### [5] [Video-As-Prompt: Unified Semantic Control for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20888)
*Yuxuan Bian,Xin Chen,Zenan Li,Tiancheng Zhi,Shen Sang,Linjie Luo,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-As-Prompt (VAP) 提出了一种新的视频生成范式，通过参考视频作为语义提示，使用混合Transformer架构指导冻结的视频扩散Transformer，实现了统一的语义控制视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频生成中统一、可泛化的语义控制这一关键挑战，现有方法要么引入伪影，要么依赖不可泛化的条件特定微调或任务特定架构。

Method: 使用参考视频作为直接语义提示，通过插拔式混合Transformer专家指导冻结的Video Diffusion Transformer，采用时间偏置位置嵌入消除虚假映射先验。

Result: VAP在开源方法中达到新的最先进水平，获得38.7%的用户偏好率，可与领先的条件特定商业模型相媲美，并展示了强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: VAP在实现通用可控视频生成方面取得了显著进展，支持各种下游应用。

Abstract: Unified, generalizable semantic control in video generation remains a
critical open challenge. Existing methods either introduce artifacts by
enforcing inappropriate pixel-wise priors from structure-based controls, or
rely on non-generalizable, condition-specific finetuning or task-specific
architectures. We introduce Video-As-Prompt (VAP), a new paradigm that reframes
this problem as in-context generation. VAP leverages a reference video as a
direct semantic prompt, guiding a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) via
a plug-and-play Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) expert. This architecture
prevents catastrophic forgetting and is guided by a temporally biased position
embedding that eliminates spurious mapping priors for robust context retrieval.
To power this approach and catalyze future research, we built VAP-Data, the
largest dataset for semantic-controlled video generation with over 100K paired
videos across 100 semantic conditions. As a single unified model, VAP sets a
new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, achieving a 38.7% user preference
rate that rivals leading condition-specific commercial models. VAP's strong
zero-shot generalization and support for various downstream applications mark a
significant advance toward general-purpose, controllable video generation.

### [6] [Focal Modulation and Bidirectional Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20933)
*Moin Safdar,Shahzaib Iqbal,Mehwish Mehmood,Mubeen Ghafoor,Tariq M. Khan,Imran Razzak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FM-BFF-Net网络，结合CNN和Transformer，使用焦点调制注意力机制和双向特征融合模块，提升医学图像分割的边界精度和对病变变化的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割对临床诊断和治疗至关重要，但传统CNN难以捕获全局上下文信息和长距离依赖关系，影响对复杂边界和多种尺寸结构的精确分割。

Method: 结合卷积和Transformer组件，采用焦点调制注意力机制增强上下文感知，引入双向特征融合模块实现编码器和解码器跨尺度表示的高效交互。

Result: 在8个公开数据集上的实验表明，FM-BFF-Net在Jaccard指数和Dice系数上持续超越现有最先进方法，验证了其有效性和适应性。

Conclusion: FM-BFF-Net通过融合CNN和Transformer的优势，有效解决了医学图像分割中的全局上下文捕获和边界精度问题，在多种医学成像场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is essential for clinical applications such as
disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease development monitoring
because it provides precise morphological and spatial information on anatomical
structures that directly influence treatment decisions. Convolutional neural
networks significantly impact image segmentation; however, since convolution
operations are local, capturing global contextual information and long-range
dependencies is still challenging. Their capacity to precisely segment
structures with complicated borders and a variety of sizes is impacted by this
restriction. Since transformers use self-attention methods to capture global
context and long-range dependencies efficiently, integrating transformer-based
architecture with CNNs is a feasible approach to overcoming these challenges.
To address these challenges, we propose the Focal Modulation and Bidirectional
Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation, referred to as
FM-BFF-Net in the remainder of this paper. The network combines convolutional
and transformer components, employs a focal modulation attention mechanism to
refine context awareness, and introduces a bidirectional feature fusion module
that enables efficient interaction between encoder and decoder representations
across scales. Through this design, FM-BFF-Net enhances boundary precision and
robustness to variations in lesion size, shape, and contrast. Extensive
experiments on eight publicly available datasets, including polyp detection,
skin lesion segmentation, and ultrasound imaging, show that FM-BFF-Net
consistently surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods in Jaccard index and
Dice coefficient, confirming its effectiveness and adaptability for diverse
medical imaging scenarios.

### [7] [Generative Point Tracking with Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20951)
*Mattie Tesfaldet,Adam W. Harley,Konstantinos G. Derpanis,Derek Nowrouzezahrai,Christopher Pal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenPT是一个生成式点跟踪框架，通过流匹配方法建模多模态轨迹，在遮挡情况下提供更准确的跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有判别式点跟踪模型在处理视觉遮挡和外观变化时只能回归到均值或众数，无法捕捉轨迹的多模态特性。

Method: 提出生成式点跟踪器(GenPT)，使用流匹配公式结合迭代精炼、跨窗口一致性先验和点坐标特定的方差调度。

Result: 在PointOdyssey、Dynamic Replica和TAP-Vid基准测试中表现优异，特别是在遮挡点跟踪方面达到最先进水平，同时在可见点跟踪上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: GenPT能够有效捕捉点轨迹的多模态特性，显著提升遮挡点跟踪精度，为不确定性环境下的点跟踪提供了生成式解决方案。

Abstract: Tracking a point through a video can be a challenging task due to uncertainty
arising from visual obfuscations, such as appearance changes and occlusions.
Although current state-of-the-art discriminative models excel in regressing
long-term point trajectory estimates -- even through occlusions -- they are
limited to regressing to a mean (or mode) in the presence of uncertainty, and
fail to capture multi-modality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
Generative Point Tracker (GenPT), a generative framework for modelling
multi-modal trajectories. GenPT is trained with a novel flow matching
formulation that combines the iterative refinement of discriminative trackers,
a window-dependent prior for cross-window consistency, and a variance schedule
tuned specifically for point coordinates. We show how our model's generative
capabilities can be leveraged to improve point trajectory estimates by
utilizing a best-first search strategy on generated samples during inference,
guided by the model's own confidence of its predictions. Empirically, we
evaluate GenPT against the current state of the art on the standard
PointOdyssey, Dynamic Replica, and TAP-Vid benchmarks. Further, we introduce a
TAP-Vid variant with additional occlusions to assess occluded point tracking
performance and highlight our model's ability to capture multi-modality. GenPT
is capable of capturing the multi-modality in point trajectories, which
translates to state-of-the-art tracking accuracy on occluded points, while
maintaining competitive tracking accuracy on visible points compared to extant
discriminative point trackers.

### [8] [3DReasonKnee: Advancing Grounded Reasoning in Medical Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20967)
*Sraavya Sambara,Sung Eun Kim,Xiaoman Zhang,Luyang Luo,Shreya Johri,Mohammed Baharoon,Du Hyun Ro,Pranav Rajpurkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DReasonKnee是首个用于3D医学图像的接地推理数据集，包含494k个高质量五元组，支持视觉语言模型在3D医学图像中进行解剖区域定位和逐步推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型难以在3D医学图像中定位解剖区域并进行逐步推理，这与临床诊断工作流程不匹配，限制了临床医生与AI的可靠协作。

Method: 创建了3DReasonKnee数据集，包含7,970个3D膝关节MRI体积，每个样本包括3D MRI体积、诊断问题、3D边界框定位、临床医生生成的诊断推理步骤和结构化严重程度评估。

Result: 建立了ReasonKnee-Bench评估框架，对5个最先进的视觉语言模型进行了基准测试，为3D接地推理提供了基线性能。

Conclusion: 3DReasonKnee作为骨科医生诊断专业知识的存储库，为推进多模态医学AI系统向3D、临床对齐的局部决策能力提供了重要测试平台。

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to ground anatomical regions
in 3D medical images and reason about them in a step-by-step manner, a key
requirement of real-world diagnostic assessment. This ability is essential for
aligning model outputs with the diagnostic workflows clinicians use in
practice, enabling trustworthy clinician-AI collaboration. Existing 3D datasets
provide localization labels, but none support this "grounded reasoning"
ability. To address this gap, we introduce 3DReasonKnee, the first 3D grounded
reasoning dataset for medical images, which provides 494k high-quality
quintuples derived from 7,970 3D knee MRI volumes. Each quintuple includes: (1)
the 3D MRI volume, (2) a diagnostic question targeting a specific anatomical
region (3) a 3D bounding box localizing the relevant anatomical structures, (4)
clinician-generated diagnostic reasoning steps that explicitly detail the 3D
reasoning process, and (5) structured severity assessments for the relevant
anatomical region. The creation and validation of 3DReasonKnee, involving over
450 hours of expert clinician time for manually segmenting MRIs and generating
reasoning chains, ensures its superior quality and clinical relevance. We
establish ReasonKnee-Bench to evaluate localization and diagnostic accuracy,
providing insight into VLM ability to perform grounding and severity assessment
across anatomical regions and diagnostic inquiries. We benchmark five
state-of-the-art VLMs, providing baseline performance for ReasonKnee-Bench. By
providing this unique resource of expert-annotated 3D reasoning pathways,
3DReasonKnee serves as a repository of orthopedic surgeons' diagnostic
expertise and offers a vital testbed for advancing multimodal medical AI
systems towards 3D, clinically aligned, localized decision-making capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种利用热偏振线索进行详细3D形状重建的新方法，该方法不依赖光照和材料特性，通过长波红外偏振成像解决可见光偏振分析的模糊性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D重建方法依赖光照和材料特性，存在局限性。热偏振成像不受这些因素影响，能更好地处理透明、半透明和异质物体。

Method: 建立了偏振观测的一般理论，使用多视角热偏振图像，通过长波红外偏振成像避免可见光偏振分析的模糊性，实现详细的3D形状恢复。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能有效重建透明、半透明和异质物体的精细细节，性能优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 热偏振成像为3D形状重建提供了一种独立于光照和材料特性的有效方法，特别适用于传统方法难以处理的物体类型。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for detailed 3D shape reconstruction
utilizing thermal polarization cues. Unlike state-of-the-art methods, the
proposed approach is independent of illumination and material properties. In
this paper, we formulate a general theory of polarization observation and show
that long-wave infrared (LWIR) polarimetric imaging is free from the
ambiguities that affect visible polarization analyses. Subsequently, we propose
a method for recovering detailed 3D shapes using multi-view thermal
polarimetric images. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
effectively reconstructs fine details in transparent, translucent, and
heterogeneous objects, outperforming existing techniques.

*Jesimon Barreto,Carlos Caetano,André Araujo,William Robson Schwartz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VESSA是一种基于视频的对象中心自监督适应方法，用于视觉基础模型的无标注域适应，通过多视角对象中心视频实现模型在新领域的自监督微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉基础模型在分布偏移和标签稀缺领域表现不佳的问题，传统监督微调不可行，而现有的自监督学习策略对视觉编码器模型效果有限。

Method: 采用自蒸馏范式，利用多视角对象中心视频进行自监督适应，精心调整预测头并部署参数高效适应技术以防止遗忘预训练知识。

Result: 在3个视觉基础模型和2个数据集上的实验表明，VESSA在下游分类任务中相比基础模型和先前适应方法实现了持续改进。

Conclusion: VESSA能够有效利用无标注的多视角对象视频进行视觉基础模型的域适应，提升模型在分布偏移场景下的性能。

Abstract: Foundation models have advanced computer vision by enabling strong
performance across diverse tasks through large-scale pretraining and supervised
fine-tuning. However, they may underperform in domains with distribution shifts
and scarce labels, where supervised fine-tuning may be infeasible. While
continued self-supervised learning for model adaptation is common for
generative language models, this strategy has not proven effective for
vision-centric encoder models. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel
formulation of self-supervised fine-tuning for vision foundation models, where
the model is adapted to a new domain without requiring annotations, leveraging
only short multi-view object-centric videos. Our method is referred to as
VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for visual
foundation models. VESSA's training technique is based on a self-distillation
paradigm, where it is critical to carefully tune prediction heads and deploy
parameter-efficient adaptation techniques - otherwise, the model may quickly
forget its pretrained knowledge and reach a degraded state. VESSA benefits
significantly from multi-view object observations sourced from different frames
in an object-centric video, efficiently learning robustness to varied capture
conditions, without the need of annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
with 3 vision foundation models on 2 datasets, VESSA demonstrates consistent
improvements in downstream classification tasks, compared to the base models
and previous adaptation methods. Code is publicly available at
https://github.com/jesimonbarreto/VESSA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于工业环境中未见物体2D检测的标准化即插即用流程，通过低光图像增强和基于基础模型的背景去除来减少域偏移和背景伪影，显著提升检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有6D姿态估计流程在工业环境中的杂乱、光照差和复杂背景等挑战条件下性能下降，检测成为关键瓶颈。

Method: 基于当前SOTA基线，采用低光图像增强和基于开放词汇检测的背景去除，抑制原始SAM输出中的误报。

Result: 在真实工业bin-picking基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著提升了检测精度，且推理开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 该方法在提升检测准确性的同时保持了实用性，证明了其有效性和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation is essential for robotic manipulation in
industrial environments. Existing pipelines typically rely on off-the-shelf
object detectors followed by cropping and pose refinement, but their
performance degrades under challenging conditions such as clutter, poor
lighting, and complex backgrounds, making detection the critical bottleneck. In
this work, we introduce a standardized and plug-in pipeline for 2D detection of
unseen objects in industrial settings. Based on current SOTA baselines, our
approach reduces domain shift and background artifacts through low-light image
enhancement and background removal guided by open-vocabulary detection with
foundation models. This design suppresses the false positives prevalent in raw
SAM outputs, yielding more reliable detections for downstream pose estimation.
Extensive experiments on real-world industrial bin-picking benchmarks from BOP
demonstrate that our method significantly boosts detection accuracy while
incurring negligible inference overhead, showing the effectiveness and
practicality of the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地震后及时评估结构完整性对公共安全和应急响应至关重要，需要自动化方法来检测混凝土结构中的裸露钢筋，这是结构损伤的重要指标。

Method: 基于深度学习框架，使用土耳其2023年地震图像数据集，通过微调、数据增强和公开数据集测试，开发YOLOv11模型检测损伤，并建立混合框架自动确定损伤等级。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过图像数据收集、标注和深度学习方法，可以实现灾后快速自动化损伤检测，适用于各种损伤环境。

Abstract: Timely assessment of integrity of structures after seismic events is crucial
for public safety and emergency response. This study focuses on assessing the
structural damage conditions using deep learning methods to detect exposed
steel reinforcement in concrete buildings and bridges after large earthquakes.
Steel bars are typically exposed after concrete spalling or large flexural or
shear cracks. The amount and distribution of exposed steel reinforcement is an
indication of structural damage and degradation. To automatically detect
exposed steel bars, new datasets of images collected after the 2023 Turkey
Earthquakes were labeled to represent a wide variety of damaged concrete
structures. The proposed method builds upon a deep learning framework, enhanced
with fine-tuning, data augmentation, and testing on public datasets. An
automated classification framework is developed that can be used to identify
inside/outside buildings and structural components. Then, a YOLOv11 (You Only
Look Once) model is trained to detect cracking and spalling damage and exposed
bars. Another YOLO model is finetuned to distinguish different categories of
structural damage levels. All these trained models are used to create a hybrid
framework to automatically and reliably determine the damage levels from input
images. This research demonstrates that rapid and automated damage detection
following disasters is achievable across diverse damage contexts by utilizing
image data collection, annotation, and deep learning approaches.

TL;DR: ZING-3D是一个零样本3D场景图生成框架，利用预训练基础模型实现开放词汇识别，支持增量更新和3D几何接地，适用于机器人应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景图生成方法局限于单视角、不支持增量更新、缺乏3D空间几何接地，这些对于具身场景至关重要。

Method: 利用VLM推理生成丰富的2D场景图，通过深度信息将其接地到3D空间，节点包含开放词汇对象特征、3D位置和语义上下文，边捕获空间和语义关系及物体间距离。

Result: 在Replica和HM3D数据集上的实验表明，ZING-3D能够有效捕获空间和关系知识，无需任务特定训练。

Conclusion: ZING-3D框架成功实现了零样本3D场景图生成，支持增量更新和几何接地，为下游机器人应用提供了丰富的语义场景表示。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about complex 3D environments requires structured
scene representations that capture not only objects but also their semantic and
spatial relationships. While recent works on 3D scene graph generation have
leveraged pretrained VLMs without task-specific fine-tuning, they are largely
confined to single-view settings, fail to support incremental updates as new
observations arrive and lack explicit geometric grounding in 3D space, all of
which are essential for embodied scenarios. In this paper, we propose, ZING-3D,
a framework that leverages the vast knowledge of pretrained foundation models
to enable open-vocabulary recognition and generate a rich semantic
representation of the scene in a zero-shot manner while also enabling
incremental updates and geometric grounding in 3D space, making it suitable for
downstream robotics applications. Our approach leverages VLM reasoning to
generate a rich 2D scene graph, which is grounded in 3D using depth
information. Nodes represent open-vocabulary objects with features, 3D
locations, and semantic context, while edges capture spatial and semantic
relations with inter-object distances. Our experiments on scenes from the
Replica and HM3D dataset show that ZING-3D is effective at capturing spatial
and relational knowledge without the need of task-specific training.

TL;DR: WaveSeg是一种新颖的语义分割解码器架构，通过在空间域和小波域联合优化特征细化，利用小波域频率先验和基于Mamba的注意力机制，实现了语义上下文和细节保留的最佳平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义分割网络过度依赖强大的预训练编码器，但使用简单的解码器，导致语义上下文和细粒度细节保留之间的权衡不理想。

Method: 提出WaveSeg解码器：1）从小波域学习高频分量作为显式先验；2）双域操作（DDO）进行多尺度融合；3）频谱分解注意力（SDA）块利用Mamba的线性复杂度长程建模增强高频结构细节；4）重参数化卷积在小波域保持低频语义完整性；5）残差引导融合整合多尺度特征。

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，WaveSeg在定量和定性上都持续优于最先进的方法，实现了高效精确的分割。

Conclusion: WaveSeg通过小波域频率先验与基于Mamba的注意力机制，为语义分割提供了语义和结构都丰富的特征表示，显著提升了分割性能。

Abstract: While recent semantic segmentation networks heavily rely on powerful
pretrained encoders, most employ simplistic decoders, leading to suboptimal
trade-offs between semantic context and fine-grained detail preservation. To
address this, we propose a novel decoder architecture, WaveSeg, which jointly
optimizes feature refinement in spatial and wavelet domains. Specifically,
high-frequency components are first learned from input images as explicit
priors to reinforce boundary details at early stages. A multi-scale fusion
mechanism, Dual Domain Operation (DDO), is then applied, and the novel Spectrum
Decomposition Attention (SDA) block is proposed, which is developed to leverage
Mamba's linear-complexity long-range modeling to enhance high-frequency
structural details. Meanwhile, reparameterized convolutions are applied to
preserve low-frequency semantic integrity in the wavelet domain. Finally, a
residual-guided fusion integrates multi-scale features with boundary-aware
representations at native resolution, producing semantically and structurally
rich feature maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that WaveSeg, leveraging wavelet-domain frequency prior with Mamba-based
attention, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both
quantitatively and qualitatively, achieving efficient and precise segmentation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合专家文本概念和视觉语言模型的新框架，用于先天性巨结肠症的神经丛分类，在准确率、精确度和特异性方面优于传统CNN模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在神经丛分类任务中表现良好但缺乏可解释性，且不符合医生的决策方式。需要将专家知识融入模型以提高临床相关性。

Method: 使用基于对比语言-图像预训练的视觉语言模型，整合从医学教科书和论文中提取的专家文本概念，通过QuiltNet编码提示来对齐临床相关语义线索和视觉特征。

Result: 模型在准确率(83.9%)、精确度(86.6%)和特异性(87.6%)方面优于VGG-19、ResNet-18和ResNet-50等CNN模型。

Conclusion: 多模态学习在组织病理学中具有潜力，整合专家知识可以产生更具临床相关性的模型输出。

Abstract: Hirschsprung's disease is defined as the congenital absence of ganglion cells
in some segment(s) of the colon. The muscle cannot make coordinated movements
to propel stool in that section, most commonly leading to obstruction. The
diagnosis and treatment for this disease require a clear identification of
different region(s) of the myenteric plexus, where ganglion cells should be
present, on the microscopic view of the tissue slide. While deep learning
approaches, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, have performed very well in
this task, they are often treated as black boxes, with minimal understanding
gained from them, and may not conform to how a physician makes decisions. In
this study, we propose a novel framework that integrates expert-derived textual
concepts into a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training-based vision-language
model to guide plexus classification. Using prompts derived from expert sources
(e.g., medical textbooks and papers) generated by large language models and
reviewed by our team before being encoded with QuiltNet, our approach aligns
clinically relevant semantic cues with visual features. Experimental results
show that the proposed model demonstrated superior discriminative capability
across different classification metrics as it outperformed CNN-based models,
including VGG-19, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50; achieving an accuracy of 83.9%, a
precision of 86.6%, and a specificity of 87.6%. These findings highlight the
potential of multi-modal learning in histopathology and underscore the value of
incorporating expert knowledge for more clinically relevant model outputs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于直方图的Retinex模型（HistRetinex），通过将Retinex模型从空间域扩展到直方图域，实现快速低光照图像增强，在保持良好视觉效果的同时显著提升处理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于Retinex的低光照图像增强方法在处理大尺寸图像时耗时较长，需要开发更高效的算法。

Method: 定义直方图位置矩阵和直方图计数矩阵，建立光照、反射率和低光照图像直方图之间的关系；构建两级优化模型，通过求解得到光照和反射率直方图的迭代公式；通过直方图匹配实现图像增强。

Result: HistRetinex在可见性和性能指标上优于现有方法，在1000*664分辨率图像上仅需1.86秒，比现有方法至少节省6.67秒。

Conclusion: 提出的HistRetinex方法在保持增强质量的同时显著提高了处理效率，为实时低光照图像增强提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Retinex-based low-light image enhancement methods are widely used due to
their excellent performance. However, most of them are time-consuming for
large-sized images. This paper extends the Retinex model from the spatial
domain to the histogram domain, and proposes a novel histogram-based Retinex
model for fast low-light image enhancement, named HistRetinex. Firstly, we
define the histogram location matrix and the histogram count matrix, which
establish the relationship among histograms of the illumination, reflectance
and the low-light image. Secondly, based on the prior information and the
histogram-based Retinex model, we construct a novel two-level optimization
model. Through solving the optimization model, we give the iterative formulas
of the illumination histogram and the reflectance histogram, respectively.
Finally, we enhance the low-light image through matching its histogram with the
one provided by HistRetinex. Experimental results demonstrate that the
HistRetinex outperforms existing enhancement methods in both visibility and
performance metrics, while executing 1.86 seconds on 1000*664 resolution
images, achieving a minimum time saving of 6.67 seconds.

TL;DR: 提出主动视觉推理(AVR)任务，扩展视觉推理到部分可观察的交互环境，需要智能体通过物理动作主动获取信息、整合多步观察并进行动态决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs主要在静态、完全可观察环境中研究视觉推理，而现实世界信息往往因遮挡或视野限制而不完整。受人类主动探索环境能力的启发，需要开发能主动获取信息的视觉推理系统。

Method: 引入CLEVR-AVR仿真基准和AVR-152k大规模数据集，提供丰富的思维链标注。开发PhysVLM-AVR模型，在马尔可夫决策过程中实现不确定性识别、信息增益预测和信息最大化动作选择。

Result: PhysVLM-AVR在CLEVR-AVR、具身推理(OpenEQA、RoboVQA)和被动视觉推理(GeoMath、Geometry30K)上达到最先进性能。分析显示当前具身MLLMs虽能检测信息不完整性，但在主动获取和整合新信息方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 主动视觉推理是视觉推理的重要扩展，现有模型在主动推理能力上存在根本性差距，需要开发能有效整合感知、推理和行动的闭环系统。

Abstract: Visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has primarily
been studied in static, fully observable settings, limiting their effectiveness
in real-world environments where information is often incomplete due to
occlusion or limited field of view. Humans, in contrast, actively explore and
interact with their environment-moving, examining, and manipulating objects-to
gather information through a closed-loop process integrating perception,
reasoning, and action. Inspired by this human capability, we introduce the
Active Visual Reasoning (AVR) task, extending visual reasoning to partially
observable, interactive environments. AVR necessitates agents to: (1) actively
acquire information via sequential physical actions, (2) integrate observations
across multiple steps for coherent reasoning, and (3) dynamically adjust
decisions based on evolving visual feedback. To rigorously evaluate AVR, we
introduce CLEVR-AVR, a simulation benchmark featuring multi-round interactive
environments designed to assess both reasoning correctness and
information-gathering efficiency. We present AVR-152k, a large-scale dataset
that offers rich Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations detailing iterative
reasoning for uncertainty identification, action-conditioned information gain
prediction, and information-maximizing action selection, crucial for training
agents in a higher-order Markov Decision Process. Building on this, we develop
PhysVLM-AVR, an MLLM achieving state-of-the-art performance on CLEVR-AVR,
embodied reasoning (OpenEQA, RoboVQA), and passive visual reasoning (GeoMath,
Geometry30K). Our analysis also reveals that current embodied MLLMs, despite
detecting information incompleteness, struggle to actively acquire and
integrate new information through interaction, highlighting a fundamental gap
in active reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向城市规模LiDAR数据的对象级变化检测方法，通过多分辨率NDT和点对平面ICP进行时序对齐，结合不确定性感知和类别约束的二分图分配来处理对象分割与合并问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法对垂直偏差、地面坡度和视角变化敏感，且缺乏对象身份信息；基于点云或体素的神经网络方法内存需求大、需要完美预对齐、难以处理薄结构，且很少考虑类别一致关联和不确定性。

Method: 采用多分辨率NDT和点对平面ICP进行时序对齐，通过注册协方差和表面粗糙度计算检测水平，使用几何代理结合语义和实例分割进行跨时期关联，采用类别约束的二分图分配处理分割合并情况。

Result: 在15个代表性Subiaco区块上达到95.2%准确率、90.4% mF1和82.6% mIoU，比Triplet KPConv在准确率、mF1和mIoU上分别提升0.2、0.2和0.8个百分点，在Decreased类别上IoU达到74.8%，提升7.6个百分点。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理城市规模LiDAR数据中的对象级变化检测，特别在对象分割合并情况下表现优异，通过不确定性感知和类别约束关联提高了检测的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: High-definition 3D city maps underpin smart transportation, digital twins,
and autonomous driving, where object level change detection across bi temporal
LiDAR enables HD map maintenance, construction monitoring, and reliable
localization. Classical DSM differencing and image based methods are sensitive
to small vertical bias, ground slope, and viewpoint mismatch and yield cellwise
outputs without object identity. Point based neural models and voxel encodings
demand large memory, assume near perfect pre alignment, degrade thin
structures, and seldom enforce class consistent association, which leaves split
or merge cases unresolved and ignores uncertainty. We propose an object
centric, uncertainty aware pipeline for city scale LiDAR that aligns epochs
with multi resolution NDT followed by point to plane ICP, normalizes height,
and derives a per location level of detection from registration covariance and
surface roughness to calibrate decisions and suppress spurious changes.
Geometry only proxies seed cross epoch associations that are refined by
semantic and instance segmentation and a class constrained bipartite assignment
with augmented dummies to handle splits and merges while preserving per class
counts. Tiled processing bounds memory without eroding narrow ground changes,
and instance level decisions combine 3D overlap, normal direction displacement,
and height and volume differences with a histogram distance, all gated by the
local level of detection to remain stable under partial overlap and sampling
variation. On 15 representative Subiaco blocks the method attains 95.2%
accuracy, 90.4% mF1, and 82.6% mIoU, exceeding Triplet KPConv by 0.2 percentage
points in accuracy, 0.2 in mF1, and 0.8 in mIoU, with the largest gain on
Decreased where IoU reaches 74.8% and improves by 7.6 points.

Conclusion: Controllable-LPMoE方法通过动态控制局部先验有效增强细粒度感知，实现高效微调，具有优秀的适应性和分割性能。

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models provide powerful feature representations for
downstream object segmentation tasks. However, when adapted to specific tasks
through the full-parameter fine-tuning, the enormous parameters being updated
often results in significant computational overhead, creating a bottleneck in
training efficiency. Although existing methods attempt to fine-tune frozen
models by directly embedding trainable prompts, these prompts lack inherent
semantic priors, limiting the adaptability of large-scale models. In this
paper, we propose a novel dynamic priors-based fine-tuning paradigm with fewer
trainable parameters, dubbed Controllable-LPMoE, which adaptively modulates
frozen foundation models by dynamically controlling local priors to enhance
fine-grained perception for specific segmentation tasks. More specifically, we
construct a lightweight dynamic mixed local priors extractor that captures
diverse local priors from input images through heterogeneous convolutions while
employing a gating network to dynamically output expert priors required for the
subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, we design a bi-directional interaction
adapter that employs cosine-aligned deformable attention and channel-oriented
adaptive scale enhancement to interact and restructure between frozen and
trainable features, achieving efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our
\href{https://github.com/CSYSI/Controllable-LPMoE} {Controllable-LPMoE}
approach, demonstrating excellent segmentation performance compared to 31
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and adaptability to multiple binary object
segmentation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像安全数据集标签粗糙模糊，无法区分导致安全问题的具体特征，需要系统方法来识别图像中细微但关键的安全差异。

Method: 利用图像编辑模型对图像进行针对性修改，仅改变与安全策略相关的特征，生成安全标签不同的反事实图像对。

Result: 构建了包含3020张图像的安全基准，涵盖9个安全类别；该框架能有效评估视觉语言模型的弱点，并作为数据增强策略提升轻量级防护模型的训练效率。

Conclusion: SafetyPairs提供了首个系统研究细粒度图像安全差异的资源，能够识别模型在区分细微图像差异方面的不足，并改进安全模型的训练。

Abstract: What exactly makes a particular image unsafe? Systematically differentiating
between benign and problematic images is a challenging problem, as subtle
changes to an image, such as an insulting gesture or symbol, can drastically
alter its safety implications. However, existing image safety datasets are
coarse and ambiguous, offering only broad safety labels without isolating the
specific features that drive these differences. We introduce SafetyPairs, a
scalable framework for generating counterfactual pairs of images, that differ
only in the features relevant to the given safety policy, thus flipping their
safety label. By leveraging image editing models, we make targeted changes to
images that alter their safety labels while leaving safety-irrelevant details
unchanged. Using SafetyPairs, we construct a new safety benchmark, which serves
as a powerful source of evaluation data that highlights weaknesses in
vision-language models' abilities to distinguish between subtly different
images. Beyond evaluation, we find our pipeline serves as an effective data
augmentation strategy that improves the sample efficiency of training
lightweight guard models. We release a benchmark containing over 3,020
SafetyPair images spanning a diverse taxonomy of 9 safety categories, providing
the first systematic resource for studying fine-grained image safety
distinctions.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in enhancing the general
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). However, when applied to improve general CoT reasoning,
existing RL frameworks often struggle to generalize beyond the training
distribution. To address this, we propose NoisyGRPO, a systematic multimodal RL
framework that introduces controllable noise into visual inputs for enhanced
exploration and explicitly models the advantage estimation process via a
Bayesian framework. Specifically, NoisyGRPO improves RL training by: (1)
\textbf{Noise-Injected Exploration Policy}: Perturbing visual inputs with
Gaussian noise to encourage exploration across a wider range of visual
scenarios; and (2) \textbf{Bayesian Advantage Estimation}: Formulating
advantage estimation as a principled Bayesian inference problem, where the
injected noise level serves as a prior and the observed trajectory reward as
the likelihood. This Bayesian modeling fuses both sources of information to
compute a robust posterior estimate of trajectory advantage, effectively
guiding MLLMs to prefer visually grounded trajectories over noisy ones.
Experiments on standard CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination
benchmarks demonstrate that NoisyGRPO substantially improves generalization and
robustness, especially in RL settings with small-scale MLLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL
3B. The project page is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CTPA依赖碘对比剂存在肾毒性和过敏反应风险，特别是在高危患者中。本研究旨在开发一种从NCCT生成DCCTPA的方法，避免对比剂使用。

Method: 使用基于CycleGAN的级联合成器，在410对CTPA和NCCT扫描上进行训练和验证，包括内部验证集和外部测试集。

Result: 该方法在定量指标上表现最佳（MAE: 156.28-165.12，PSNR: 20.27-20.71，SSIM: 0.98），血管分割Dice系数达0.70，血管体积ICC为0.81，显著优于NCCT。

Conclusion: DCCTPA能有效增强血管结构，特别是小血管，在避免对比剂风险的同时保持了诊断价值。

Abstract: Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) is the reference standard
for diagnosing pulmonary vascular diseases such as Pulmonary Embolism (PE) and
Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH). However, its reliance on
iodinated contrast agents poses risks including nephrotoxicity and allergic
reactions, particularly in high-risk patients. This study proposes a method to
generate Digital Contrast CTPA (DCCTPA) from Non-Contrast CT (NCCT) scans using
a cascaded synthesizer based on Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial
Networks (CycleGAN). Totally retrospective 410 paired CTPA and NCCT scans were
obtained from three centers. The model was trained and validated internally on
249 paired images. Extra dataset that comprising 161 paired images was as test
set for model generalization evaluation and downstream clinical tasks
validation. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, the proposed method
achieved the best comprehensive performance by evaluating quantitative metrics
(For validation, MAE: 156.28, PSNR: 20.71 and SSIM: 0.98; For test, MAE:
165.12, PSNR: 20.27 and SSIM: 0.98) and qualitative visualization,
demonstrating valid vessel enhancement, superior image fidelity and structural
preservation. The approach was further applied to downstream tasks of pulmonary
vessel segmentation and vascular quantification. On the test set, the average
Dice, clDice, and clRecall of artery and vein pulmonary segmentation was 0.70,
0.71, 0.73 and 0.70, 0.72, 0.75 respectively, all markedly improved compared
with NCCT inputs.\@ Inter-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for vessel volume
between DCCTPA and CTPA was significantly better than that between NCCT and
CTPA (Average ICC : 0.81 vs 0.70), indicating effective vascular enhancement in
DCCTPA, especially for small vessels.

TL;DR: 提出Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG)作为视觉空间智能的显式结构化表示方法，通过网格编码物体布局和空间关系，解决现有方法依赖文本提示的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础模型中的视觉空间智能评估主要依赖文本提示和VQA式评分，这掩盖了几何信息、引入了语言捷径，并削弱了对真正空间技能的归因。

Method: 引入SIG结构化网格模式，显式编码物体布局、物体间关系和物理基础先验，作为文本的补充通道，为基础模型推理提供忠实、组合式的场景结构表示。

Result: 在少样本上下文学习中，SIG相比纯VQA表示在所有VSI指标上都产生了更一致、更稳定和更全面的增益，表明其作为数据标注和训练模式的潜力。

Conclusion: SIG为学习视觉空间智能提供了有前景的数据标注和训练模式，并发布了SIGBench基准数据集支持机器和人类样式的VSI任务。

Abstract: How to integrate and verify spatial intelligence in foundation models remains
an open challenge. Current practice often proxies Visual-Spatial Intelligence
(VSI) with purely textual prompts and VQA-style scoring, which obscures
geometry, invites linguistic shortcuts, and weakens attribution to genuinely
spatial skills. We introduce Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG): a structured,
grid-based schema that explicitly encodes object layouts, inter-object
relations, and physically grounded priors. As a complementary channel to text,
SIG provides a faithful, compositional representation of scene structure for
foundation-model reasoning. Building on SIG, we derive SIG-informed evaluation
metrics that quantify a model's intrinsic VSI, which separates spatial
capability from language priors. In few-shot in-context learning with
state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs (e.g. GPT- and Gemini-family models), SIG
yields consistently larger, more stable, and more comprehensive gains across
all VSI metrics compared to VQA-only representations, indicating its promise as
a data-labeling and training schema for learning VSI. We also release SIGBench,
a benchmark of 1.4K driving frames annotated with ground-truth SIG labels and
human gaze traces, supporting both grid-based machine VSI tasks and
attention-driven, human-like VSI tasks in autonomous-driving scenarios.

Motivation: 传统Flow Matching模型使用单一大型网络学习从噪声到数据的整个生成轨迹，难以同时捕捉不同时间步的独特信号特征，且推理成本高昂。

Method: 采用分块设计，每个速度块专注于指定区间；引入语义特征引导模块，在预训练表示上显式调节速度块；提出轻量级特征残差近似策略。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上，BFM相比现有Flow Matching方法在保持相似生成性能的同时，推理复杂度加速2.1x到4.9x。

Conclusion: BFM在推理效率和样本质量之间建立了显著改进的帕累托前沿，为高效高质量数据生成提供了新框架。

Abstract: Recently, Flow Matching models have pushed the boundaries of high-fidelity
data generation across a wide range of domains. It typically employs a single
large network to learn the entire generative trajectory from noise to data.
Despite their effectiveness, this design struggles to capture distinct signal
characteristics across timesteps simultaneously and incurs substantial
inference costs due to the iterative evaluation of the entire model. To address
these limitations, we propose Blockwise Flow Matching (BFM), a novel framework
that partitions the generative trajectory into multiple temporal segments, each
modeled by smaller but specialized velocity blocks. This blockwise design
enables each block to specialize effectively in its designated interval,
improving inference efficiency and sample quality. To further enhance
generation fidelity, we introduce a Semantic Feature Guidance module that
explicitly conditions velocity blocks on semantically rich features aligned
with pretrained representations. Additionally, we propose a lightweight Feature
Residual Approximation strategy that preserves semantic quality while
significantly reducing inference cost. Extensive experiments on ImageNet
256x256 demonstrate that BFM establishes a substantially improved Pareto
frontier over existing Flow Matching methods, achieving 2.1x to 4.9x
accelerations in inference complexity at comparable generation performance.

TL;DR: TokenCLIP是一个基于CLIP的细粒度异常检测框架，通过动态对齐视觉标记和可学习文本子空间，实现更精确的异常语义学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常使用单一文本空间来对齐不同对象和领域的视觉语义，这种不加区分的对齐方式难以准确捕捉多样化的异常语义。

Method: 将标记无关的文本空间扩展为一组正交子空间，基于语义亲和力动态分配每个标记到子空间组合，通过最优传输问题实现动态对齐，并使用top-k掩码稀疏化传输计划。

Result: 大量实验证明了TokenCLIP的优越性能。

Conclusion: TokenCLIP通过动态标记级对齐机制，在零样本异常检测任务中取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Adapting CLIP for anomaly detection on unseen objects has shown strong
potential in a zero-shot manner. However, existing methods typically rely on a
single textual space to align with visual semantics across diverse objects and
domains. The indiscriminate alignment hinders the model from accurately
capturing varied anomaly semantics. We propose TokenCLIP, a token-wise
adaptation framework that enables dynamic alignment between visual and
learnable textual spaces for fine-grained anomaly learning. Rather than mapping
all visual tokens to a single, token-agnostic textual space, TokenCLIP aligns
each token with a customized textual subspace that represents its visual
characteristics. Explicitly assigning a unique learnable textual space to each
token is computationally intractable and prone to insufficient optimization. We
instead expand the token-agnostic textual space into a set of orthogonal
subspaces, and then dynamically assign each token to a subspace combination
guided by semantic affinity, which jointly supports customized and efficient
token-wise adaptation. To this end, we formulate dynamic alignment as an
optimal transport problem, where all visual tokens in an image are transported
to textual subspaces based on semantic similarity. The transport constraints of
OT ensure sufficient optimization across subspaces and encourage them to focus
on different semantics. Solving the problem yields a transport plan that
adaptively assigns each token to semantically relevant subspaces. A top-k
masking is then applied to sparsify the plan and specialize subspaces for
distinct visual regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
TokenCLIP.

Motivation: 现有静态基准存在数据污染和饱和风险，导致性能评估失真，需要更可靠的评估协议

Method: 使用图表示VQA样本，通过知识增强基准演进(KBE)框架整合多模态知识，重构问题和扩展问题，实现难度可控评估

Result: KBE缓解了数据污染和饱和风险，提供了对MLLM能力更全面的评估

Conclusion: KBE框架为多模态大语言模型提供了更可靠、动态的评估方法

Abstract: The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) calls for more
reliable evaluation protocols. Existing static benchmarks suffer from the
potential risk of data contamination and saturation, leading to inflated or
misleading performance evaluations. To address these issues, we first apply
Graph formulation to represent a static or dynamic VQA sample. With the
formulation, we propose Knowledge-enhanced Benchmark Evolution(KBE), a dynamic
multimodal evaluation framework. KBE first analyzes the original static
benchmark, then expands it by integrating multimodal knowledge, transforming
the static benchmark into a controllable, dynamic evolving version. Crucially,
KBE can both reconstruct questions by Re-selecting visual information in the
original image and expand existing questions with external textual knowledge.
It enables difficulty-controllable evaluation by adjusting the degree of
question exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KBE alleviates the
risk of data contamination, data saturation, and provides a more comprehensive
assessment of MLLM capabilities.

TL;DR: 本文提出了iSM框架，系统解决了捷径模型的五个核心问题：复合引导缺陷、固定引导不灵活、频率偏差、自一致性冲突和弯曲流轨迹，显著提升了生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 捷径模型虽然支持单步、少步和多步采样，但由于存在五个关键性能瓶颈（复合引导缺陷、固定引导不灵活、频率偏差、自一致性冲突和弯曲流轨迹），其广泛应用受到限制。

Method: 提出iSM统一训练框架，包含四个关键改进：内在引导提供动态控制、多级小波损失缓解频率偏差、缩放最优传输减少训练方差、双EMA策略平衡训练稳定性与自一致性。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256上的广泛实验表明，该方法在单步、少步和多步生成中相比基线捷径模型都取得了显著的FID改进。

Conclusion: iSM框架使捷径模型成为一类可行且具有竞争力的生成模型，解决了长期存在的性能瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Shortcut models represent a promising, non-adversarial paradigm for
generative modeling, uniquely supporting one-step, few-step, and multi-step
sampling from a single trained network. However, their widespread adoption has
been stymied by critical performance bottlenecks. This paper tackles the five
core issues that held shortcut models back: (1) the hidden flaw of compounding
guidance, which we are the first to formalize, causing severe image artifacts;
(2) inflexible fixed guidance that restricts inference-time control; (3) a
pervasive frequency bias driven by a reliance on low-level distances in the
direct domain, which biases reconstructions toward low frequencies; (4)
divergent self-consistency arising from a conflict with EMA training; and (5)
curvy flow trajectories that impede convergence. To address these challenges,
we introduce iSM, a unified training framework that systematically resolves
each limitation. Our framework is built on four key improvements: Intrinsic
Guidance provides explicit, dynamic control over guidance strength, resolving
both compounding guidance and inflexibility. A Multi-Level Wavelet Loss
mitigates frequency bias to restore high-frequency details. Scaling Optimal
Transport (sOT) reduces training variance and learns straighter, more stable
generative paths. Finally, a Twin EMA strategy reconciles training stability
with self-consistency. Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256 x 256 demonstrate
that our approach yields substantial FID improvements over baseline shortcut
models across one-step, few-step, and multi-step generation, making shortcut
models a viable and competitive class of generative models.

TL;DR: TSSR是一种基于离散扩散模型的新方法，用于生成高质量的艺术风格3D网格，通过并行生成和解耦训练实现高效准确的网格生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现高精度的token预测并支持并行生成，相比顺序自回归方法具有显著优势，通过同时观察所有网格token来提升效率和可控性。

Method: 采用解耦训练和混合推理，将生成过程分为拓扑雕刻和形状细化两个阶段；改进的Hourglass架构结合双向注意力和旋转位置嵌入；引入连接损失作为拓扑约束。

Result: 在复杂数据集上的实验表明，TSSR能够生成高质量的3D艺术风格网格，支持高达10,000个面，空间分辨率达到1024^3。

Conclusion: TSSR通过并行生成和解耦训练策略，在3D网格生成任务中实现了高效且高质量的生成效果，代码将在GitHub上开源。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Topology Sculptor, Shape Refiner (TSSR), a novel
method for generating high-quality, artist-style 3D meshes based on Discrete
Diffusion Models (DDMs). Our primary motivation for TSSR is to achieve highly
accurate token prediction while enabling parallel generation, a significant
advantage over sequential autoregressive methods. By allowing TSSR to "see" all
mesh tokens concurrently, we unlock a new level of efficiency and control. We
leverage this parallel generation capability through three key innovations: 1)
Decoupled Training and Hybrid Inference, which distinctly separates the
DDM-based generation into a topology sculpting stage and a subsequent shape
refinement stage. This strategic decoupling enables TSSR to effectively capture
both intricate local topology and overarching global shape. 2) An Improved
Hourglass Architecture, featuring bidirectional attention enriched by
face-vertex-sequence level Rotational Positional Embeddings (RoPE), thereby
capturing richer contextual information across the mesh structure. 3) A novel
Connection Loss, which acts as a topological constraint to further enhance the
realism and fidelity of the generated meshes. Extensive experiments on complex
datasets demonstrate that TSSR generates high-quality 3D artist-style meshes,
capable of achieving up to 10,000 faces at a remarkable spatial resolution of
$1024^3$. The code will be released at:

TL;DR: SAGE-3D将3D高斯泼溅升级为可执行的、语义和物理对齐的环境，包含对象中心语义标注和物理感知执行连接，构建了首个基于3DGS的VLN基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅虽然具有逼真的实时渲染能力，但缺乏细粒度语义和物理可执行性，无法满足视觉语言导航需求。

Method: 提出SAGE-3D框架，包含对象中心语义标注（为3DGS添加对象级细粒度标注）和物理感知执行连接（嵌入碰撞对象并构建丰富的物理接口）。

Result: 构建了InteriorGS数据集（包含1K对象标注的3DGS室内场景）和SAGE-Bench基准测试（包含2M VLN数据），在VLN-CE Unseen任务上基线性能提升31%。

Conclusion: 3DGS场景数据虽然更难收敛，但展现出强大的泛化能力，为缩小模拟与现实差距提供了有效工具。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a 3D representation method with photorealistic
real-time rendering capabilities, is regarded as an effective tool for
narrowing the sim-to-real gap. However, it lacks fine-grained semantics and
physical executability for Visual-Language Navigation (VLN). To address this,
we propose SAGE-3D (Semantically and Physically Aligned Gaussian Environments
for 3D Navigation), a new paradigm that upgrades 3DGS into an executable,
semantically and physically aligned environment. It comprises two components:
(1) Object-Centric Semantic Grounding, which adds object-level fine-grained
annotations to 3DGS; and (2) Physics-Aware Execution Jointing, which embeds
collision objects into 3DGS and constructs rich physical interfaces. We release
InteriorGS, containing 1K object-annotated 3DGS indoor scene data, and
introduce SAGE-Bench, the first 3DGS-based VLN benchmark with 2M VLN data.
Experiments show that 3DGS scene data is more difficult to converge, while
exhibiting strong generalizability, improving baseline performance by 31% on
the VLN-CE Unseen task. The data and code will be available soon.

TL;DR: 提出了FineRS框架，通过两阶段强化学习方法解决MLLMs在高分辨率图像中精确定位和分割超小物体的挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs由于输入分辨率限制，在处理高分辨率图像中的微小物体时面临精确定位和理解的困难

Method: 采用粗到精的两阶段管道：全局语义探索(GSE)生成文本响应和粗略目标区域，局部感知细化(LPR)进行精确边界框和分割掩码生成，并引入定位知情回溯奖励耦合两个阶段

Result: 在FineRS-4k和公共数据集上的实验表明，该方法在指令引导分割和视觉推理任务上持续优于最先进的MLLM方法

Conclusion: FineRS框架有效解决了MLLMs在高分辨率场景中处理微小物体的挑战，在分割和推理任务上表现出色

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, due to the restricted
input resolutions, MLLMs face significant challenges in precisely understanding
and localizing visual details in high-resolution images -- particularly when
dealing with extra-small objects embedded in cluttered contexts. To address
this issue, we propose \textsc{FineRS}, a two-stage MLLM-based reinforcement
learning framework for jointly reasoning and segmenting extremely small objects
within high-resolution scenes. \textsc{FineRS} adopts a coarse-to-fine pipeline
comprising Global Semantic Exploration (GSE) and Localized Perceptual
Refinement (LPR). Specifically, GSE performs instruction-guided reasoning to
generate a textural response and a coarse target region, while LPR refines this
region to produce an accurate bounding box and segmentation mask. To couple the
two stages, we introduce a locate-informed retrospective reward, where LPR's
outputs are used to optimize GSE for more robust coarse region exploration. %
Additionally, we present \textsc{FineRS}-4k, a new dataset for evaluating MLLMs
on attribute-level reasoning and pixel-level segmentation on subtle,
small-scale targets in complex high-resolution scenes. Experimental results on
\textsc{FineRS}-4k and public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM-based approaches on both instruction-guided
segmentation and visual reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了VL-SAE稀疏自编码器，将视觉-语言表示编码为隐藏层激活，每个神经元对应一个由语义相似的图像和文本表示的概念，从而用统一的概念集解释这些表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于难以将多模态表示的语义映射到统一的概念集，视觉-语言对齐组件的可解释性尚未得到研究。

Method: 使用基于距离的编码器和两个模态特定的解码器构建VL-SAE，通过余弦相似度显式对齐多模态表示，并鼓励语义相似的表示在自监督训练中表现出一致的神经元激活。

Result: 在多个VLMs（如CLIP、LLaVA）上的实验表明，VL-SAE在解释和增强视觉-语言对齐方面具有优越能力，能提高零样本图像分类和幻觉消除等下游任务的性能。

Conclusion: VL-SAE通过将视觉-语言表示对齐到概念层面，既能解释对齐过程，又能增强对齐效果，为多模态表示的可解释性提供了新思路。

Abstract: The alignment of vision-language representations endows current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities.
However, the interpretability of the alignment component remains uninvestigated
due to the difficulty in mapping the semantics of multi-modal representations
into a unified concept set. To address this problem, we propose VL-SAE, a
sparse autoencoder that encodes vision-language representations into its hidden
activations. Each neuron in its hidden layer correlates to a concept
represented by semantically similar images and texts, thereby interpreting
these representations with a unified concept set. To establish the
neuron-concept correlation, we encourage semantically similar representations
to exhibit consistent neuron activations during self-supervised training.
First, to measure the semantic similarity of multi-modal representations, we
perform their alignment in an explicit form based on cosine similarity. Second,
we construct the VL-SAE with a distance-based encoder and two modality-specific
decoders to ensure the activation consistency of semantically similar
representations. Experiments across multiple VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA)
demonstrate the superior capability of VL-SAE in interpreting and enhancing the
vision-language alignment. For interpretation, the alignment between vision and
language representations can be understood by comparing their semantics with
concepts. For enhancement, the alignment can be strengthened by aligning
vision-language representations at the concept level, contributing to
performance improvements in downstream tasks, including zero-shot image
classification and hallucination elimination. Codes are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前计算框架仅限于二维表示，无法捕捉细胞形态在扰动下的复杂性，这限制了准确虚拟细胞模型的发展。

Method: FORM包含形态编码器（通过多通道VQGAN端到端训练学习紧凑3D表示）和基于扩散的扰动轨迹模块，在包含65,000多个3D细胞体积的大规模数据集上训练。

Result: FORM支持无条件形态合成和条件模拟扰动细胞状态，能够预测下游信号活动、模拟组合扰动效应，并建模未见扰动状态间的形态动态转换。

Conclusion: FORM和MorphoEval通过高分辨率预测模拟，将形态、扰动和功能联系起来，推动3D虚拟细胞的实现。

Abstract: Understanding how cells respond to external stimuli is a central challenge in
biomedical research and drug development. Current computational frameworks for
modelling cellular responses remain restricted to two-dimensional
representations, limiting their capacity to capture the complexity of cell
morphology under perturbation. This dimensional constraint poses a critical
bottleneck for the development of accurate virtual cell models. Here, we
present FORM, a machine learning framework for predicting perturbation-induced
changes in three-dimensional cellular structure. FORM consists of two
components: a morphology encoder, trained end-to-end via a novel multi-channel
VQGAN to learn compact 3D representations of cell shape, and a diffusion-based
perturbation trajectory module that captures how morphology evolves across
perturbation conditions. Trained on a large-scale dataset of over 65,000
multi-fluorescence 3D cell volumes spanning diverse chemical and genetic
perturbations, FORM supports both unconditional morphology synthesis and
conditional simulation of perturbed cell states. Beyond generation, FORM can
predict downstream signalling activity, simulate combinatorial perturbation
effects, and model morphodynamic transitions between states of unseen
perturbations. To evaluate performance, we introduce MorphoEval, a benchmarking
suite that quantifies perturbation-induced morphological changes in structural,
statistical, and biological dimensions. Together, FORM and MorphoEval work
toward the realisation of the 3D virtual cell by linking morphology,
perturbation, and function through high-resolution predictive simulation.

Motivation: 传统多尺度特征融合方法在复杂果园环境中难以处理苹果叶病病变的异质性，仅整合CNN提取的多层特征，未能充分考虑局部与全局特征之间的关系。

Method: 使用CNN提取局部病变细节特征，Vision Transformer捕捉全局结构关系，自适应特征融合模块动态融合特征，并采用多模态图像-文本学习方法利用预训练CLIP权重实现视觉特征与疾病语义描述的深度对齐。

Result: 在公开苹果病害数据集和自建数据集上分别达到97.38%和96.12%的准确率，优于多个基线方法。

Conclusion: CT-CLIP在农业病害识别方面表现出强大能力，显著提高了复杂环境条件下的识别准确率，为农业应用中的自动化病害识别提供了创新实用的解决方案。

Abstract: In complex orchard environments, the phenotypic heterogeneity of different
apple leaf diseases, characterized by significant variation among lesions,
poses a challenge to traditional multi-scale feature fusion methods. These
methods only integrate multi-layer features extracted by convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and fail to adequately account for the relationships between
local and global features. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-branch
recognition framework named CNN-Transformer-CLIP (CT-CLIP). The framework
synergistically employs a CNN to extract local lesion detail features and a
Vision Transformer to capture global structural relationships. An Adaptive
Feature Fusion Module (AFFM) then dynamically fuses these features, achieving
optimal coupling of local and global information and effectively addressing the
diversity in lesion morphology and distribution. Additionally, to mitigate
interference from complex backgrounds and significantly enhance recognition
accuracy under few-shot conditions, this study proposes a multimodal image-text
learning approach. By leveraging pre-trained CLIP weights, it achieves deep
alignment between visual features and disease semantic descriptions.
Experimental results show that CT-CLIP achieves accuracies of 97.38% and 96.12%
on a publicly available apple disease and a self-built dataset, outperforming
several baseline methods. The proposed CT-CLIP demonstrates strong capabilities
in recognizing agricultural diseases, significantly enhances identification
accuracy under complex environmental conditions, provides an innovative and
practical solution for automated disease recognition in agricultural
applications.

Conclusion: 该方法通过增强语义感知能力，有效提高了无人机跟踪在挑战性场景下的准确性和鲁棒性，同时提供了灵活的速度-精度权衡方案。

Abstract: UAV tracking can be widely applied in scenarios such as disaster rescue,
environmental monitoring, and logistics transportation. However, existing UAV
tracking methods predominantly emphasize speed and lack exploration in semantic
awareness, which hinders the search region from extracting accurate
localization information from the template. The limitation results in
suboptimal performance under typical UAV tracking challenges such as camera
motion, fast motion, and low resolution, etc. To address this issue, we propose
a dynamic semantic aware correlation modeling tracking framework. The core of
our framework is a Dynamic Semantic Relevance Generator, which, in combination
with the correlation map from the Transformer, explore semantic relevance. The
approach enhances the search region's ability to extract important information
from the template, improving accuracy and robustness under the aforementioned
challenges. Additionally, to enhance the tracking speed, we design a pruning
method for the proposed framework. Therefore, we present multiple model
variants that achieve trade-offs between speed and accuracy, enabling flexible
deployment according to the available computational resources. Experimental
results validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving competitive
performance on multiple UAV tracking datasets. The code is available at

Conclusion: 眼动引导训练能显著提高自我中心VLMs的准确性和鲁棒性，为在辅助机器人和人机协作等现实场景中增强VLM预测能力奠定了基础。

Abstract: Eye gaze offers valuable cues about attention, short-term intent, and future
actions, making it a powerful signal for modeling egocentric behavior. In this
work, we propose a gaze-regularized framework that enhances VLMs for two key
egocentric understanding tasks: fine-grained future event prediction and
current activity understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on
visual inputs or use gaze as an auxiliary input signal , our method uses gaze
only during training. We introduce a gaze-regularized attention mechanism that
aligns model focus with human visual gaze. This design is flexible and modular,
allowing it to generalize across multiple VLM architectures that utilize
attention. Experimental results show that our approach improves semantic
prediction scores by up to 11 for future event prediction and around 7 for
current activity understanding, compared to the corresponding baseline models
trained without gaze regularization. These results highlight the value of
gaze-guided training in improving the accuracy and robustness of egocentric
VLMs. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for using human gaze to
enhance the predictive capabilities of VLMs in real-world scenarios like
assistive robots and human-machine collaboration. Code and additional

*Valentin Boussot,Cédric Hémon,Jean-Claude Nunes,Jean-Louis Dillenseger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个用于从MRI和CBCT生成合成CT的统一流程，使用2.5D U-Net++模型，结合了像素级L1损失和基于SAM与TotalSegmentator的感知损失。评估了两种配准策略，发现基于IMPACT的配准比互信息配准能获得更准确的对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决合成CT生成中配准误差传播到监督学习的问题，开发更稳健和可泛化的sCT合成模型。

Method: 使用2.5D U-Net++模型，ResNet-34编码器，联合训练各解剖区域并针对每个区域进行微调。损失函数结合L1损失和IMPACT-Synth感知损失。采用AdamW优化器，基于补丁的输入，测试时使用数据增强和五折集成。

Result: 在本地测试集上，基于IMPACT的配准比互信息配准实现了更准确和解剖一致的对齐，sCT合成效果更好，MAE更低，解剖结构更真实。但在公共验证集上，使用Elastix对齐数据训练的模型得分更高，反映了配准偏差。

Conclusion: 配准误差会传播到监督学习中，影响训练和评估，可能以牺牲解剖保真度为代价来提升性能指标。IMPACT通过促进解剖一致的对齐来减轻这种偏差，支持开发更稳健的sCT合成模型。

Abstract: We participated in the SynthRAD2025 challenge (Tasks 1 and 2) with a unified
pipeline for synthetic CT (sCT) generation from MRI and CBCT, implemented using
the KonfAI framework. Our model is a 2.5D U-Net++ with a ResNet-34 encoder,
trained jointly across anatomical regions and fine-tuned per region. The loss
function combined pixel-wise L1 loss with IMPACT-Synth, a perceptual loss
derived from SAM and TotalSegmentator to enhance structural fidelity. Training
was performed using AdamW (initial learning rate = 0.001, halved every 25k
steps) on patch-based, normalized, body-masked inputs (320x320 for MRI, 256x256
for CBCT), with random flipping as the only augmentation. No post-processing
was applied. Final predictions leveraged test-time augmentation and five-fold
ensembling. The best model was selected based on validation MAE. Two
registration strategies were evaluated: (i) Elastix with mutual information,
consistent with the challenge pipeline, and (ii) IMPACT, a feature-based
similarity metric leveraging pretrained segmentation networks. On the local
test sets, IMPACT-based registration achieved more accurate and anatomically
consistent alignments than mutual-information-based registration, resulting in
improved sCT synthesis with lower MAE and more realistic anatomical structures.
On the public validation set, however, models trained with Elastix-aligned data
achieved higher scores, reflecting a registration bias favoring alignment
strategies consistent with the evaluation pipeline. This highlights how
registration errors can propagate into supervised learning, influencing both
training and evaluation, and potentially inflating performance metrics at the
expense of anatomical fidelity. By promoting anatomically consistent alignment,
IMPACT helps mitigate this bias and supports the development of more robust and
generalizable sCT synthesis models.

constraints. Traditional diffusion models produce high-fidelity images by
performing a fixed number of denoising steps, regardless of downstream
transmission limitations. However, in practical cloud-to-device scenarios,
limited bandwidth often necessitates heavy compression, leading to loss of fine
textures and wasted computation. To address this, we introduce a joint
end-to-end training strategy where the diffusion model is conditioned on a
target quality level derived from the available bandwidth. During training, the
model learns to adaptively modulate the denoising process, enabling early-stop
sampling that maintains perceptual quality appropriate to the target
transmission condition. Our method requires minimal architectural changes and
leverages a lightweight quality embedding to guide the denoising trajectory.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the
visual fidelity of bandwidth-adapted generations compared to naive
early-stopping, offering a promising solution for efficient image delivery in
bandwidth-constrained environments. Code is available at:

TL;DR: TerraGen是一个统一的布局到图像生成框架，能够为遥感视觉任务（如检测、分割、提取）生成具有空间可控性的图像，解决了现有生成数据增强框架任务孤立且忽略地理空间约束的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成数据增强框架是任务孤立的，每个视觉任务需要训练独立的生成模型，并且忽略了地理信息和空间约束的建模，这限制了遥感视觉任务的发展。

Method: TerraGen引入地理空间布局编码器，统一边界框和分割掩码输入，结合多尺度注入方案和掩码加权损失，从全局结构到细节明确编码空间约束。

Result: 实验结果显示TerraGen在多样化任务中实现了最佳生成图像质量，并可作为通用数据增强生成器，在完整数据和少样本场景下显著提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: TerraGen展示了强大的跨任务泛化能力，为遥感视觉任务提供了灵活、空间可控的图像合成解决方案。

Abstract: Remote sensing vision tasks require extensive labeled data across multiple,
interconnected domains. However, current generative data augmentation
frameworks are task-isolated, i.e., each vision task requires training an
independent generative model, and ignores the modeling of geographical
information and spatial constraints. To address these issues, we propose
\textbf{TerraGen}, a unified layout-to-image generation framework that enables
flexible, spatially controllable synthesis of remote sensing imagery for
various high-level vision tasks, e.g., detection, segmentation, and extraction.
Specifically, TerraGen introduces a geographic-spatial layout encoder that
unifies bounding box and segmentation mask inputs, combined with a multi-scale
injection scheme and mask-weighted loss to explicitly encode spatial
constraints, from global structures to fine details. Also, we construct the
first large-scale multi-task remote sensing layout generation dataset
containing 45k images and establish a standardized evaluation protocol for this
task. Experimental results show that our TerraGen can achieve the best
generation image quality across diverse tasks. Additionally, TerraGen can be
used as a universal data-augmentation generator, enhancing downstream task
performance significantly and demonstrating robust cross-task generalisation in
both full-data and few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: 提出的深度一致性约束无缝图像拼接方法能够有效解决视差引起的对齐问题，在保持最优性能的同时显著提高算法效率。

Abstract: Image stitching synthesizes images captured from multiple perspectives into a
single image with a broader field of view. The significant variations in object
depth often lead to large parallax, resulting in ghosting and misalignment in
the stitched results. To address this, we propose a
depth-consistency-constrained seamless-free image stitching method. First, to
tackle the multi-view alignment difficulties caused by parallax, a multi-stage
mechanism combined with global depth regularization constraints is developed to
enhance the alignment accuracy of the same apparent target across different
depth ranges. Second, during the multi-view image fusion process, an optimal
stitching seam is determined through graph-based low-cost computation, and a
soft-seam region is diffused to precisely locate transition areas, thereby
effectively mitigating alignment errors induced by parallax and achieving
natural and seamless stitching results. Furthermore, considering the
computational overhead in the shift regression process, a reparameterization
strategy is incorporated to optimize the structural design, significantly
improving algorithm efficiency while maintaining optimal performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method against
the existing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/DLUT-YRH/DSFN.

Motivation: 推动长视频平台的视频检索技术发展，解决现有方法在处理未剪辑视频和多模态查询方面的局限性。

Method: 构建MUVR基准，包含53K个未剪辑视频、1,050个多模态查询和84K个匹配项，支持文本描述、视频标签和掩码提示等多种查询方式，并定义了六个级别的视觉对应关系。

Abstract: We propose the Multi-modal Untrimmed Video Retrieval task, along with a new
benchmark (MUVR) to advance video retrieval for long-video platforms. MUVR aims
to retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant segments using multi-modal
queries. It has the following features: 1) Practical retrieval paradigm: MUVR
supports video-centric multi-modal queries, expressing fine-grained retrieval
needs through long text descriptions, video tag prompts, and mask prompts. It
adopts a one-to-many retrieval paradigm and focuses on untrimmed videos,
tailored for long-video platform applications. 2) Multi-level visual
correspondence: To cover common video categories (e.g., news, travel, dance)
and precisely define retrieval matching criteria, we construct multi-level
visual correspondence based on core video content (e.g., news events, travel
locations, dance moves) which users are interested in and want to retrieve. It
covers six levels: copy, event, scene, instance, action, and others. 3)
Comprehensive evaluation criteria: We develop 3 versions of MUVR (i.e., Base,
Filter, QA). MUVR-Base/Filter evaluates retrieval models, while MUVR-QA
assesses MLLMs in a question-answering format. We also propose a Reranking
Score to evaluate the reranking ability of MLLMs. MUVR consists of 53K
untrimmed videos from the video platform Bilibili, with 1,050 multi-modal
queries and 84K matches. Extensive evaluations of 3 state-of-the-art video
retrieval models, 6 image-based VLMs, and 10 MLLMs are conducted. MUVR reveals
the limitations of retrieval methods in processing untrimmed videos and
multi-modal queries, as well as MLLMs in multi-video understanding and
reranking. Our code and benchmark is available at

Method: 利用预训练的视觉语言模型和通用提示策略识别多样化的图像相关轴，通过通用概念编码器自适应地将视觉特征绑定到发现的轴上，优化组合锚定目标确保各轴可独立操作。

Abstract: Human intelligence effortlessly interprets visual scenes along a rich
spectrum of semantic dimensions. However, existing approaches to
language-grounded visual concept learning are limited to a few predefined
primitive axes, such as color and shape, and are typically explored in
synthetic datasets. In this work, we propose a scalable framework that
adaptively identifies image-related concept axes and grounds visual concepts
along these axes in real-world scenes. Leveraging a pretrained vision-language
model and our universal prompting strategy, our framework identifies a diverse
image-related axes without any prior knowledge. Our universal concept encoder
adaptively binds visual features to the discovered axes without introducing
additional model parameters for each concept. To ground visual concepts along
the discovered axes, we optimize a compositional anchoring objective, which
ensures that each axis can be independently manipulated without affecting
others. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on subsets of
ImageNet, CelebA-HQ, and AFHQ, showcasing superior editing capabilities across
diverse real-world concepts that are too varied to be manually predefined. Our
method also exhibits strong compositional generalization, outperforming
existing visual concept learning and text-based editing methods. The code is

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种各向异性池化策略，通过广义中值池化和学习数据相关的池化系数，改进了基于查找表的图像恢复CNN方法，在保持快速和资源节约的同时提升了恢复质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于查找表的CNN图像恢复方法使用平均池化融合不同方向的像素块结果，但这种方法不适合各向异性信号结构，限制了性能提升。

Method: 引入广义中值池化替代平均池化，并进一步扩展为学习数据相关的池化系数，使不同方向的像素块贡献能够自适应加权。

Result: 在各种恢复基准测试中，各向异性池化策略在感知质量和数值指标上都优于现有的LUT可实现的CNN方法。

Conclusion: 各向异性池化策略有效解决了LUT-based CNN中平均池化对各向异性结构不适配的问题，显著提升了图像恢复性能。

Abstract: Table look-up realization of image restoration CNNs has the potential of
achieving competitive image quality while being much faster and resource frugal
than the straightforward CNN implementation. The main technical challenge
facing the LUT-based CNN algorithm designers is to manage the table size
without overly restricting the receptive field. The prevailing strategy is to
reuse the table for small pixel patches of different orientations (apparently
assuming a degree of isotropy) and then fuse the look-up results. The fusion is
currently done by average pooling, which we find being ill suited to
anisotropic signal structures. To alleviate the problem, we investigate and
discuss anisotropic pooling methods to replace naive averaging for improving
the performance of the current LUT-realizable CNN restoration methods. First,
we introduce the method of generalized median pooling which leads to measurable
gains over average pooling. We then extend this idea by learning data-dependent
pooling coefficients for each orientation, so that they can adaptively weigh
the contributions of differently oriented pixel patches. Experimental results
on various restoration benchmarks show that our anisotropic pooling strategy
yields both perceptually and numerically superior results compared to existing
LUT-realizable CNN methods.

Motivation: 现有方法在建模3D对象和场景的层次结构时存在局限性：要么需要多次渲染来捕获不同粒度级别的嵌入，显著增加推理时间；要么依赖预定义的封闭离散层次结构，对现实世界中多样和细微结构的泛化能力差。

Method: 提出OpenHype方法，利用双曲几何的特性，在连续双曲潜在空间中表示场景层次结构，自然编码多尺度关系，并支持通过潜在空间中的测地线路径平滑遍历层次结构。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，OpenHype方法优于最先进的方法，在3D场景理解方面表现出更高的效率和适应性。

Conclusion: 通过使用连续双曲潜在空间表示场景层次结构，OpenHype能够更有效地建模3D对象和场景的固有层次结构，为自主代理提供更全面的环境理解。

Abstract: Modeling the inherent hierarchical structure of 3D objects and 3D scenes is
highly desirable, as it enables a more holistic understanding of environments
for autonomous agents. Accomplishing this with implicit representations, such
as Neural Radiance Fields, remains an unexplored challenge. Existing methods
that explicitly model hierarchical structures often face significant
limitations: they either require multiple rendering passes to capture
embeddings at different levels of granularity, significantly increasing
inference time, or rely on predefined, closed-set discrete hierarchies that
generalize poorly to the diverse and nuanced structures encountered by agents
in the real world. To address these challenges, we propose OpenHype, a novel
approach that represents scene hierarchies using a continuous hyperbolic latent
space. By leveraging the properties of hyperbolic geometry, OpenHype naturally
encodes multi-scale relationships and enables smooth traversal of hierarchies
through geodesic paths in latent space. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on standard benchmarks, demonstrating superior efficiency and
adaptability in 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Interactive world models that simulate object dynamics are crucial for
robotics, VR, and AR. However, it remains a significant challenge to learn
physics-consistent dynamics models from limited real-world video data,
especially for deformable objects with spatially-varying physical properties.
To overcome the challenge of data scarcity, we propose PhysWorld, a novel
framework that utilizes a simulator to synthesize physically plausible and
diverse demonstrations to learn efficient world models. Specifically, we first
construct a physics-consistent digital twin within MPM simulator via
constitutive model selection and global-to-local optimization of physical
properties. Subsequently, we apply part-aware perturbations to the physical
properties and generate various motion patterns for the digital twin,
synthesizing extensive and diverse demonstrations. Finally, using these
demonstrations, we train a lightweight GNN-based world model that is embedded
with physical properties. The real video can be used to further refine the
physical properties. PhysWorld achieves accurate and fast future predictions
for various deformable objects, and also generalizes well to novel
interactions. Experiments show that PhysWorld has competitive performance while
enabling inference speeds 47 times faster than the recent state-of-the-art
method, i.e., PhysTwin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注离线视频异常检测，而在线VAD由于实时性和计算强度很少受到关注，需要解决在线场景下的复杂性问题。

Method: 使用预训练视觉语言模型处理流式输入，结合LSTM启发的预测机制捕获时间依赖，设计评分队列和异常先验动态存储最近分数，为LLM提供区分正常与异常行为的指导。

Result: 在UCF-Crime和XD-Violence数据集上的实验表明，MoniTor优于现有最先进方法，且无需训练就能与弱监督方法竞争。

Conclusion: MoniTor为在线视频异常检测提供了一种有效的无需训练解决方案，通过结合VLMs和时间建模能力实现了优异的性能。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to locate unusual activities or behaviors
within videos. Recently, offline VAD has garnered substantial research
attention, which has been invigorated by the progress in large language models
(LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), offering the potential for a more
nuanced understanding of anomalies. However, online VAD has seldom received
attention due to real-time constraints and computational intensity. In this
paper, we introduce a novel Memory-based online scoring queue scheme for
Training-free VAD (MoniTor), to address the inherent complexities in online
VAD. Specifically, MoniTor applies a streaming input to VLMs, leveraging the
capabilities of pre-trained large-scale models. To capture temporal
dependencies more effectively, we incorporate a novel prediction mechanism
inspired by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This ensures the model can
effectively model past states and leverage previous predictions to identify
anomalous behaviors. Thereby, it better understands the current frame.
Moreover, we design a scoring queue and an anomaly prior to dynamically store
recent scores and cover all anomalies in the monitoring scenario, providing
guidance for LLMs to distinguish between normal and abnormal behaviors over
time. We evaluate MoniTor on two large datasets (i.e., UCF-Crime and
XD-Violence) containing various surveillance and real-world scenarios. The
results demonstrate that MoniTor outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is
competitive with weakly supervised methods without training. Code is available

Motivation: 虽然语言和视觉语言模型在各种任务中表现出色，但其内部机制仍不完全清楚。本文旨在研究注意力头在语义和视觉属性上的专业化模式，为理解和控制大规模生成模型提供工具。

Method: 基于已有的可解释性方法，从信号处理角度重新解释通过最终解码层探测中间激活的实践，能够以原则性方式分析多个样本，并根据与目标概念的相关性对注意力头进行排序。

Result: 在单模态和多模态变换器中发现了注意力头级别的专业化一致模式。仅编辑通过该方法选择的1%的注意力头，就能可靠地抑制或增强模型输出中的目标概念。该方法在问答、毒性缓解等语言任务以及图像分类、字幕生成等视觉语言任务中得到验证。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了注意力层中存在可解释和可控的结构，为理解和编辑大规模生成模型提供了简单工具。

Abstract: Language and vision-language models have shown impressive performance across
a wide range of tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain only partly
understood. In this work, we study how individual attention heads in
text-generative models specialize in specific semantic or visual attributes.
Building on an established interpretability method, we reinterpret the practice
of probing intermediate activations with the final decoding layer through the
lens of signal processing. This lets us analyze multiple samples in a
principled way and rank attention heads based on their relevance to target
concepts. Our results show consistent patterns of specialization at the head
level across both unimodal and multimodal transformers. Remarkably, we find
that editing as few as 1% of the heads, selected using our method, can reliably
suppress or enhance targeted concepts in the model output. We validate our
approach on language tasks such as question answering and toxicity mitigation,
as well as vision-language tasks including image classification and captioning.
Our findings highlight an interpretable and controllable structure within
attention layers, offering simple tools for understanding and editing
large-scale generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频修复方法在严重内容退化情况下表现不佳，且往往忽视时空稳定性，导致对视频后半部分控制不足。

Method: 提出VidSplice框架，包含CoSpliced模块进行首帧传播策略，以及上下文控制器模块编码一致性先验并注入I2V生成主干。

Result: 广泛评估表明VidSplice在多样化视频修复场景中取得竞争性表现，显著提升前景对齐和运动稳定性。

Conclusion: VidSplice通过间隔帧先验和精心设计的模块，有效解决了现有方法在时空稳定性方面的不足。

Abstract: Recent video inpainting methods often employ image-to-video (I2V) priors to
model temporal consistency across masked frames. While effective in moderate
cases, these methods struggle under severe content degradation and tend to
overlook spatiotemporal stability, resulting in insufficient control over the
latter parts of the video. To address these limitations, we decouple video
inpainting into two sub-tasks: multi-frame consistent image inpainting and
masked area motion propagation. We propose VidSplice, a novel framework that
introduces spaced-frame priors to guide the inpainting process with
spatiotemporal cues. To enhance spatial coherence, we design a CoSpliced Module
to perform first-frame propagation strategy that diffuses the initial frame
content into subsequent reference frames through a splicing mechanism.
Additionally, we introduce a delicate context controller module that encodes
coherent priors after frame duplication and injects the spliced video into the
I2V generative backbone, effectively constraining content distortion during
generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that VidSplice achieves
competitive performance across diverse video inpainting scenarios. Moreover,
its design significantly improves both foreground alignment and motion
stability, outperforming existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在胸部X光诊断中准确性很高，但由于其黑盒性质限制了临床广泛应用。临床医生需要透明、可验证的解释来信任自动化诊断并识别潜在失败模式。

Method: 训练基于transcoder的稀疏自编码器，在BiomedCLIP诊断分类器上分解医学图像表示为可解释的视觉模式。在MIMIC-CXR数据集上训练100个transcoder集成，发现约5000个单语义模式，涵盖心脏、肺部、胸膜、结构、设备和伪影等类别。

Result: CXR-LanIC在五个关键发现上实现了有竞争力的诊断准确性，同时提供透明归因，预测可分解为20-50个可解释模式，并带有可验证的激活图库。

Conclusion: 该研究表明医学AI系统可以既准确又可解释，通过透明、基于临床的解释支持更安全的临床部署。关键创新在于从针对特定诊断目标训练的分类器中提取可解释特征，而非通用嵌入，确保发现的模式与临床决策直接相关。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable accuracy in chest X-ray
diagnosis, yet their widespread clinical adoption remains limited by the
black-box nature of their predictions. Clinicians require transparent,
verifiable explanations to trust automated diagnoses and identify potential
failure modes. We introduce CXR-LanIC (Language-Grounded Interpretable
Classifier for Chest X-rays), a novel framework that addresses this
interpretability challenge through task-aligned pattern discovery. Our approach
trains transcoder-based sparse autoencoders on a BiomedCLIP diagnostic
classifier to decompose medical image representations into interpretable visual
patterns. By training an ensemble of 100 transcoders on multimodal embeddings
from the MIMIC-CXR dataset, we discover approximately 5,000 monosemantic
patterns spanning cardiac, pulmonary, pleural, structural, device, and artifact
categories. Each pattern exhibits consistent activation behavior across images
sharing specific radiological features, enabling transparent attribution where
predictions decompose into 20-50 interpretable patterns with verifiable
activation galleries. CXR-LanIC achieves competitive diagnostic accuracy on
five key findings while providing the foundation for natural language
explanations through planned large multimodal model annotation. Our key
innovation lies in extracting interpretable features from a classifier trained
on specific diagnostic objectives rather than general-purpose embeddings,
ensuring discovered patterns are directly relevant to clinical decision-making,
demonstrating that medical AI systems can be both accurate and interpretable,
supporting safer clinical deployment through transparent, clinically grounded
explanations.

Conclusion: 细胞级聚合和组织-细胞交互在细粒度计算病理学中发挥关键作用。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of histopathological images demands integration of
information across spatial and semantic scales, from nuclear morphology and
cellular textures to global tissue organization and disease-specific patterns.
Although recent foundation models in pathology have shown strong capabilities
in capturing global tissue context, their omission of cell-level feature
modeling remains a key limitation for fine-grained tasks such as cancer subtype
classification. To address this, we propose a dual-stream architecture that
models the interplay between macroscale tissue features and aggregated cellular
representations. To efficiently aggregate information from large cell sets, we
propose a receptance-weighted key-value aggregation model, a recurrent
transformer that captures inter-cell dependencies with linear complexity.
Furthermore, we introduce a bidirectional tissue-cell interaction module to
enable mutual attention between localized cellular cues and their surrounding
tissue environment. Experiments on four histopathological subtype
classification benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms existing
models, demonstrating the critical role of cell-level aggregation and
tissue-cell interaction in fine-grained computational pathology.

ensuring better results than methods without position data. We tested GRAP-MOT
on recordings acquired in a closed-area model and on publicly available real
datasets that fulfil the requirement of a highly congested space, showing the
superiority of our proposition. Finally, we analyzed existing metrics used to
compare MOT algorithms and concluded that IDF1 is more adequate than MOTA in
such comparisons. We made our code, along with the acquired dataset, publicly
available.

Abstract: Placental abruption is a severe complication during pregnancy, and its early
accurate diagnosis is crucial for ensuring maternal and fetal safety.
Traditional ultrasound diagnostic methods heavily rely on physician experience,
leading to issues such as subjective bias and diagnostic inconsistencies. This
paper proposes an improved model, EH-YOLOv11n (Enhanced Hemorrhage-YOLOv11n),
based on small-sample learning, aiming to achieve automatic detection of
hematoma features in placental ultrasound images. The model enhances
performance through multidimensional optimization: it integrates wavelet
convolution and coordinate convolution to strengthen frequency and spatial
feature extraction; incorporates a cascaded group attention mechanism to
suppress ultrasound artifacts and occlusion interference, thereby improving
bounding box localization accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate a
detection accuracy of 78%, representing a 2.5% improvement over YOLOv11n and a
13.7% increase over YOLOv8. The model exhibits significant superiority in
precision-recall curves, confidence scores, and occlusion scenarios. Combining
high accuracy with real-time processing, this model provides a reliable
solution for computer-aided diagnosis of placental abruption, holding
significant clinical application value.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了GranViT，一种新型视觉Transformer，通过区域级自回归训练将细粒度特征提取与语义对齐集成到LLMs中，在细粒度识别、多模态VQA和OCR理解任务上取得SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉编码器专注于全局图像表示但忽视细粒度区域分析，由于缺乏细粒度标注数据和预训练范式，在细粒度感知方面存在局限。

Method: 构建Gran-29M数据集（200万张图像，1.8亿区域级标注），开发预训练-适应框架和自蒸馏机制，通过边界框到标题回归和标题到边界框回归增强视觉表示和定位能力。

Result: 在细粒度识别、多模态VQA和OCR理解任务上取得最先进结果，展现出对多种LLMs的强大可迁移性。

Conclusion: GranViT通过细粒度区域级训练显著提升了视觉编码器的感知能力，为多模态大语言模型提供了更强大的视觉理解基础。

Abstract: Vision encoders are indispensable for allowing impressive performance of
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in vision language tasks such as
visual question answering and reasoning. However, existing vision encoders
focus on global image representations but overlook fine-grained regional
analysis. They are limited in fine grained perception due to the scarcity of
fine grained annotated data and the lack of a fine grained pre-training
paradigm. In this paper, we propose GranViT, a novel Vision Transformer that
integrates fine-grained feature extraction with semantic alignment to Large
Language Models (LLMs) via region level autoregressive training. We first
construct Gran-29M, a dataset comprising 2million natural and OCR images paired
with over 180 million high-quality region-level annotations, to enable large
scale fine grained pretraining. Consequently, we develop a
pretraining-adaptation framework along with a self distillation mechanism to
train fine-grained GranViT on Gran-29M. We sufficiently exploit the
fine-grained annotations from Gran-29M to resort to bounding-box-to-caption
regression to enhance localized visual representation of the vision encoder in
the pretraining and caption-to-bounding-box regression to improve vision
feature utilization and localization for LLM in the adaptation. We further
incorporate a self distillation mechanism that imposes explicit localization
constraints on the vision encoder to strengthen its regional reasoning
capability. Extensive experiments show that GranViT surpasses existing vision
encoders and attains strong transferability to varying LLMs. Remarkably, it
achieves state-of-the-art results on fine-grained recognition, multimodal VQA,
and OCR understanding.

*Kaibo Wang,Jianda Mao,Tong Wu,Yang Xiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一视角，将条件引导重新定义为不动点迭代，并引入了前瞻引导(FSG)方法，在早期扩散阶段优先解决长间隔子问题以提高效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解并改进无分类器引导(CFG)的操作机制是文本到图像扩散模型研究的核心焦点，现有方法基于不同的理论解释，限制了设计空间并模糊了关键设计选择

Method: 提出统一视角，将条件引导重新定义为不动点迭代，寻找潜在空间在条件和无条件生成下产生一致输出的黄金路径。引入FSG方法，在早期扩散阶段优先解决长间隔子问题并增加迭代次数

Result: 在多样化数据集和模型架构上的广泛实验验证了FSG在图像质量和计算效率方面优于最先进方法

Conclusion: 这项工作为条件引导提供了新的视角，并释放了自适应设计的潜力

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is an essential component of text-to-image
diffusion models, and understanding and advancing its operational mechanisms
remains a central focus of research. Existing approaches stem from divergent
theoretical interpretations, thereby limiting the design space and obscuring
key design choices. To address this, we propose a unified perspective that
reframes conditional guidance as fixed point iterations, seeking to identify a
golden path where latents produce consistent outputs under both conditional and
unconditional generation. We demonstrate that CFG and its variants constitute a
special case of single-step short-interval iteration, which is theoretically
proven to exhibit inefficiency. To this end, we introduce Foresight Guidance
(FSG), which prioritizes solving longer-interval subproblems in early diffusion
stages with increased iterations. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets
and model architectures validate the superiority of FSG over state-of-the-art
methods in both image quality and computational efficiency. Our work offers
novel perspectives for conditional guidance and unlocks the potential of
adaptive design.

*Ciara Rowles,Varun Jampani,Simon Donné,Shimon Vainer,Julian Parker,Zach Evans*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foley Control是一种轻量级视频引导Foley音效生成方法，通过冻结预训练的单模态模型，仅学习它们之间的小型交叉注意力桥接来实现视频到音频的同步生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态系统需要端到端重新训练，参数量大且缺乏模块化。Foley Control旨在保持预训练模型优势的同时，实现高效的视频-音频同步，并保持提示驱动的可控性。

Method: 将V-JEPA2视频嵌入连接到冻结的Stable Audio Open DiT文本到音频模型，在现有文本交叉注意力后插入紧凑的视频交叉注意力。视频token经过池化以减少内存消耗和稳定训练。

Result: 在精选的视频-音频基准测试中，Foley Control在时间和语义对齐方面表现具有竞争力，参数量远少于最近的多模态系统，同时保持了提示驱动的可控性和生产友好的模块化。

Conclusion: Foley Control提供了一种高效、轻量级的视频引导Foley音效生成方案，其桥接设计可扩展到其他音频模态，如语音生成。

Abstract: Foley Control is a lightweight approach to video-guided Foley that keeps
pretrained single-modality models frozen and learns only a small
cross-attention bridge between them. We connect V-JEPA2 video embeddings to a
frozen Stable Audio Open DiT text-to-audio (T2A) model by inserting compact
video cross-attention after the model's existing text cross-attention, so
prompts set global semantics while video refines timing and local dynamics. The
frozen backbones retain strong marginals (video; audio given text) and the
bridge learns the audio-video dependency needed for synchronization -- without
retraining the audio prior. To cut memory and stabilize training, we pool video
tokens before conditioning. On curated video-audio benchmarks, Foley Control
delivers competitive temporal and semantic alignment with far fewer trainable
parameters than recent multi-modal systems, while preserving prompt-driven
controllability and production-friendly modularity (swap/upgrade encoders or
the T2A backbone without end-to-end retraining). Although we focus on
Video-to-Foley, the same bridge design can potentially extend to other audio
modalities (e.g., speech).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Chunk-GRPO方法，将GRPO优化从步级提升到块级，解决了优势归因不准确和忽略生成时序动态的问题，在文本到图像生成中取得了更好的偏好对齐和图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GRPO方法存在两个关键限制：优势归因不准确，以及忽略了生成的时序动态特性。

Method: 将连续步骤分组为连贯的'块'来捕捉流匹配的内在时序动态，在块级别优化策略，并引入可选的加权采样策略。

Result: 实验表明Chunk-GRPO在偏好对齐和图像质量方面都取得了优越结果。

Conclusion: 块级优化为基于GRPO的方法展现了良好前景。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown strong potential for
flow-matching-based text-to-image (T2I) generation, but it faces two key
limitations: inaccurate advantage attribution, and the neglect of temporal
dynamics of generation. In this work, we argue that shifting the optimization
paradigm from the step level to the chunk level can effectively alleviate these
issues. Building on this idea, we propose Chunk-GRPO, the first chunk-level
GRPO-based approach for T2I generation. The insight is to group consecutive
steps into coherent 'chunk's that capture the intrinsic temporal dynamics of
flow matching, and to optimize policies at the chunk level. In addition, we
introduce an optional weighted sampling strategy to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that ChunkGRPO achieves superior
results in both preference alignment and image quality, highlighting the
promise of chunk-level optimization for GRPO-based methods.

*Xuzhao Li,Xuchen Li,Shiyu Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MATrack是一个专为夜间无人机跟踪设计的自适应系统，通过多尺度层次混合、自适应关键令牌门和夜间模板校准器三个核心模块，解决了夜间跟踪中的特征一致性、复杂背景识别和长序列稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夜间无人机跟踪面临低光照条件、杂乱背景和频繁视角变化等挑战，现有方法存在视觉伪影、计算成本高和动态信息利用不足等问题。

Method: MATrack采用三个核心模块：多尺度层次混合增强静态和动态模板间的特征一致性，自适应关键令牌门准确识别复杂背景中的目标信息，夜间模板校准器确保长序列跟踪的稳定性。

Result: 在UAVDark135基准测试中，MATrack的精度、归一化精度和AUC分别比最先进方法提高了5.9%、5.4%和4.2%，同时保持81 FPS的实时处理速度。

Conclusion: MATrack在真实无人机平台上验证了可靠性，能够为夜间搜救和边境巡逻等关键机器人应用提供稳定有效的夜间无人机跟踪支持。

Abstract: Nighttime UAV tracking faces significant challenges in real-world robotics
operations. Low-light conditions not only limit visual perception capabilities,
but cluttered backgrounds and frequent viewpoint changes also cause existing
trackers to drift or fail during deployment. To address these difficulties,
researchers have proposed solutions based on low-light enhancement and domain
adaptation. However, these methods still have notable shortcomings in actual
UAV systems: low-light enhancement often introduces visual artifacts, domain
adaptation methods are computationally expensive and existing lightweight
designs struggle to fully leverage dynamic object information. Based on an
in-depth analysis of these key issues, we propose MATrack-a multiscale adaptive
system designed specifically for nighttime UAV tracking. MATrack tackles the
main technical challenges of nighttime tracking through the collaborative work
of three core modules: Multiscale Hierarchy Blende (MHB) enhances feature
consistency between static and dynamic templates. Adaptive Key Token Gate
accurately identifies object information within complex backgrounds. Nighttime
Template Calibrator (NTC) ensures stable tracking performance over long
sequences. Extensive experiments show that MATrack achieves a significant
performance improvement. On the UAVDark135 benchmark, its precision, normalized
precision and AUC surpass state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 5.9%, 5.4% and
4.2% respectively, while maintaining a real-time processing speed of 81 FPS.
Further tests on a real-world UAV platform validate the system's reliability,
demonstrating that MATrack can provide stable and effective nighttime UAV
tracking support for critical robotics applications such as nighttime search
and rescue and border patrol.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TIGER是一个两阶段的文本图像超分辨率框架，通过“文本优先、图像随后”的范式，将字形恢复与图像增强解耦，解决了现有方法在图像质量和文本可读性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式超分辨率方法在自然图像上表现良好，但会扭曲文本，造成图像质量和文本可读性之间的根本性权衡。

Method: TIGER采用两阶段框架：首先重建精确的文本结构，然后使用这些结构指导后续的全图像超分辨率，实现从字形到图像的引导。

Result: 在UltraZoom-ST数据集上的广泛实验表明，TIGER实现了最先进的性能，在提升可读性的同时保持了整体图像质量。

Conclusion: TIGER通过解耦文本和图像处理，打破了图像超分辨率中质量与可读性的权衡，同时贡献了首个极端缩放场景文本数据集UltraZoom-ST。

Abstract: Current generative super-resolution methods show strong performance on
natural images but distort text, creating a fundamental trade-off between image
quality and textual readability. To address this, we introduce \textbf{TIGER}
(\textbf{T}ext-\textbf{I}mage \textbf{G}uided
sup\textbf{E}r-\textbf{R}esolution), a novel two-stage framework that breaks
this trade-off through a \textit{"text-first, image-later"} paradigm.
\textbf{TIGER} explicitly decouples glyph restoration from image enhancement:
it first reconstructs precise text structures and then uses them to guide
subsequent full-image super-resolution. This glyph-to-image guidance ensures
both high fidelity and visual consistency. To support comprehensive training
and evaluation, we also contribute the \textbf{UltraZoom-ST} (UltraZoom-Scene
Text), the first scene text dataset with extreme zoom (\textbf{$\times$14.29}).
Extensive experiments show that \textbf{TIGER} achieves
\textbf{state-of-the-art} performance, enhancing readability while preserving
overall image quality.

TL;DR: 本文提出两种深度学习模型（ANN和CNN）用于MEG记录中的发作间期棘波自动检测，在仅有单专家标注的临床数据上表现优于现有方法，并采用交互式机器学习策略改善标注质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 耐药性癫痫术前评估中，MEG记录的发作间期棘波手动检测耗时且易出错，现有自动化方法要么需要大量标注数据，要么在非典型数据上缺乏鲁棒性，不适用于临床实践。

Method: 提出基于特征的ANN和CNN两种模型架构，在59名患者数据库上训练，采用交互式机器学习策略迭代改进数据标注质量，并与最先进模型进行对比。

Result: 两种模型在10名测试患者上均优于现有方法（F1分数：CNN=0.46，ANN=0.44），交互式学习策略证明模型对噪声标注具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 简单架构的模型在分析复杂且标注不完美的数据时具有鲁棒性，交互式机器学习方法可加速数据标注，所提模型是自动检测发作间期棘波的有效工具。

Abstract: In drug-resistant epilepsy, presurgical evaluation of epilepsy can be
considered. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has been shown to be an effective exam
to inform the localization of the epileptogenic zone through the localization
of interictal epileptic spikes. Manual detection of these pathological
biomarkers remains a fastidious and error-prone task due to the high
dimensionality of MEG recordings, and interrater agreement has been reported to
be only moderate. Current automated methods are unsuitable for clinical
practice, either requiring extensively annotated data or lacking robustness on
non-typical data. In this work, we demonstrate that deep learning models can be
used for detecting interictal spikes in MEG recordings, even when only temporal
and single-expert annotations are available, which represents real-world
clinical practice. We propose two model architectures: a feature-based
artificial neural network (ANN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN),
trained on a database of 59 patients, and evaluated against a state-of-the-art
model to classify short time windows of signal. In addition, we employ an
interactive machine learning strategy to iteratively improve our data
annotation quality using intermediary model outputs. Both proposed models
outperform the state-of-the-art model (F1-scores: CNN=0.46, ANN=0.44) when
tested on 10 holdout test patients. The interactive machine learning strategy
demonstrates that our models are robust to noisy annotations. Overall, results
highlight the robustness of models with simple architectures when analyzing
complex and imperfectly annotated data. Our method of interactive machine
learning offers great potential for faster data annotation, while our models
represent useful and efficient tools for automated interictal spikes detection.

Motivation: 显著目标检测面临数据受限问题，像素级标注成本高昂，导致相关子任务需要单独训练模型。

Method: 使用多模态扩散管道生成超过139,000张高分辨率图像的S3OD数据集，通过扩散和DINO-v3特征提取标签，并采用迭代生成框架优先处理困难类别。提出流线型多掩码解码器处理显著目标检测中的固有模糊性。

Result: 仅使用合成数据训练的模型在跨数据集泛化中实现20-50%的错误减少，微调版本在DIS和HR-SOD基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 大规模合成数据和模糊感知架构能有效解决显著目标检测中的数据受限问题，显著提升模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Salient object detection exemplifies data-bounded tasks where expensive
pixel-precise annotations force separate model training for related subtasks
like DIS and HR-SOD. We present a method that dramatically improves
generalization through large-scale synthetic data generation and
ambiguity-aware architecture. We introduce S3OD, a dataset of over 139,000
high-resolution images created through our multi-modal diffusion pipeline that
extracts labels from diffusion and DINO-v3 features. The iterative generation
framework prioritizes challenging categories based on model performance. We
propose a streamlined multi-mask decoder that naturally handles the inherent
ambiguity in salient object detection by predicting multiple valid
interpretations. Models trained solely on synthetic data achieve 20-50% error
reduction in cross-dataset generalization, while fine-tuned versions reach
state-of-the-art performance across DIS and HR-SOD benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在资源受限场景中，跨模态对齐模型因数据质量差、相关性弱而导致的过度自信和性能下降问题。

Method: 采用随机扰动引入可控噪声模拟不确定性，结合嵌入平滑校准嵌入空间中的相似度分布，共同降低过度自信。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，Modest-Align在检索任务中优于现有方法，仅用CLIP 1/100的训练数据和1/600的GPU时间就达到竞争性结果。

Conclusion: 该方法为现实世界低资源场景下的跨模态对齐提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment aims to map heterogeneous modalities into a shared
latent space, as exemplified by models like CLIP, which benefit from
large-scale image-text pretraining for strong recognition capabilities.
However, when operating in resource-constrained settings with limited or
low-quality data, these models often suffer from overconfidence and degraded
performance due to the prevalence of ambiguous or weakly correlated image-text
pairs. Current contrastive learning approaches, which rely on single positive
pairs, further exacerbate this issue by reinforcing overconfidence on uncertain
samples. To address these challenges, we propose Modest-Align, a lightweight
alignment framework designed for robustness and efficiency. Our approach
leverages two complementary strategies -- Random Perturbation, which introduces
controlled noise to simulate uncertainty, and Embedding Smoothing, which
calibrates similarity distributions in the embedding space. These mechanisms
collectively reduce overconfidence and improve performance on noisy or weakly
aligned samples. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that Modest-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in retrieval
tasks, achieving competitive results with over 100x less training data and 600x
less GPU time than CLIP. Our method offers a practical and scalable solution
for cross-modal alignment in real-world, low-resource scenarios.

Motivation: 当前视频生成模型在几何一致性方面仍有不足，存在几何不一致、运动不稳定和视觉伪影等问题，影响了真实3D场景的呈现效果。3D一致性的视频生成对下游生成和重建任务具有重要意义。

Method: 采用基于偏好的优化方法，通过成对极线几何约束对齐扩散模型，直接处理相机轨迹不稳定和几何伪影问题。该方法高效实施几何原则，无需端到端可微分性，在静态场景和动态相机设置下进行训练。

Result: 评估表明，经典几何约束比现代学习指标提供更稳定的优化信号，学习指标会产生噪声目标从而影响对齐质量。模型在动态内容上具有良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过将数据驱动的深度学习与经典几何计算机视觉相结合，提出了一种实用的方法，可在不牺牲视觉质量的情况下生成空间一致的视频。

Abstract: Video generation models have progressed tremendously through large latent
diffusion transformers trained with rectified flow techniques. Yet these models
still struggle with geometric inconsistencies, unstable motion, and visual
artifacts that break the illusion of realistic 3D scenes. 3D-consistent video
generation could significantly impact numerous downstream applications in
generation and reconstruction tasks. We explore how epipolar geometry
constraints improve modern video diffusion models. Despite massive training
data, these models fail to capture fundamental geometric principles underlying
visual content. We align diffusion models using pairwise epipolar geometry
constraints via preference-based optimization, directly addressing unstable
camera trajectories and geometric artifacts through mathematically principled
geometric enforcement. Our approach efficiently enforces geometric principles
without requiring end-to-end differentiability. Evaluation demonstrates that
classical geometric constraints provide more stable optimization signals than
modern learned metrics, which produce noisy targets that compromise alignment
quality. Training on static scenes with dynamic cameras ensures high-quality
measurements while the model generalizes effectively to diverse dynamic
content. By bridging data-driven deep learning with classical geometric
computer vision, we present a practical method for generating spatially
consistent videos without compromising visual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不同领域点云数据规模有限的问题，同时避免混合域预训练导致的下游任务性能下降，实现跨域知识的自适应整合。

Method: 设计异构域适配器（预训练时使用适应模式，微调时使用融合模式）和域特征生成器，指导点云特征适应不同下游任务。

Result: 在四个不同点云分析任务中表现优异：ScanObjectNN物体分类达到95.18%，Bosphorus面部表情识别达到88.45%。

Conclusion: DAP-MAE能够通过单一预训练有效整合跨域知识，显著提升点云分析任务的性能，解决了数据稀缺和域对齐问题。

Abstract: Compared to 2D data, the scale of point cloud data in different domains
available for training, is quite limited. Researchers have been trying to
combine these data of different domains for masked autoencoder (MAE)
pre-training to leverage such a data scarcity issue. However, the prior
knowledge learned from mixed domains may not align well with the downstream 3D
point cloud analysis tasks, leading to degraded performance. To address such an
issue, we propose the Domain-Adaptive Point Cloud Masked Autoencoder (DAP-MAE),
an MAE pre-training method, to adaptively integrate the knowledge of
cross-domain datasets for general point cloud analysis. In DAP-MAE, we design a
heterogeneous domain adapter that utilizes an adaptation mode during
pre-training, enabling the model to comprehensively learn information from
point clouds across different domains, while employing a fusion mode in the
fine-tuning to enhance point cloud features. Meanwhile, DAP-MAE incorporates a
domain feature generator to guide the adaptation of point cloud features to
various downstream tasks. With only one pre-training, DAP-MAE achieves
excellent performance across four different point cloud analysis tasks,
reaching 95.18% in object classification on ScanObjectNN and 88.45% in facial
expression recognition on Bosphorus.

Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法无法捕捉学生模型认知能力的动态演变过程，导致知识转移效果不佳。

Method: 基于Gompertz曲线的阶段感知蒸馏策略，动态调整蒸馏损失权重；使用Wasserstein距离度量特征差异，梯度匹配对齐反向传播行为；多损失目标统一这些组件。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上，使用ResNet50和MobileNet_v2等架构，Gompertz-CNN相比传统蒸馏方法分别获得最高8%和4%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: Gompertz-CNN框架通过模拟人类学习过程的动态特性，有效提升了知识蒸馏的性能，为动态知识转移提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dynamic knowledge distillation framework,
Gompertz-CNN, which integrates the Gompertz growth model into the training
process to address the limitations of traditional knowledge distillation.
Conventional methods often fail to capture the evolving cognitive capacity of
student models, leading to suboptimal knowledge transfer. To overcome this, we
propose a stage-aware distillation strategy that dynamically adjusts the weight
of distillation loss based on the Gompertz curve, reflecting the student's
learning progression: slow initial growth, rapid mid-phase improvement, and
late-stage saturation. Our framework incorporates Wasserstein distance to
measure feature-level discrepancies and gradient matching to align backward
propagation behaviors between teacher and student models. These components are
unified under a multi-loss objective, where the Gompertz curve modulates the
influence of distillation losses over time. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10
and CIFAR-100 using various teacher-student architectures (e.g., ResNet50 and
MobileNet_v2) demonstrate that Gompertz-CNN consistently outperforms
traditional distillation methods, achieving up to 8% and 4% accuracy gains on
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively.

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了长尾识别方法在北美相机陷阱图像数据集上的应用，通过实验优化LTR损失函数和正则化方法，显著提升了物种识别准确率，并在跨域测试中展现了更好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决野外数据收集中的严重类别不平衡问题，特别是北美相机陷阱图像数据集存在的长尾分布问题，其中最大的'Head'类别占了超过50%的图像。

Method: 基于PyTorch Wildlife模型，系统研究长尾识别方法，包括各种LTR损失函数和LTR敏感的正则化技术，并在NACTI数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 最佳配置在NACTI测试集上达到99.40%的Top-1准确率，相比使用标准交叉熵和Adam的95.51%基线有显著提升。在跨域测试中，优化后的长尾增强模型在ENA-Detection数据集上达到52.55%的准确率。

Conclusion: LTR增强的调度器选择与最先进的LTR损失函数结合能带来一致改进，但LTR方法仍无法充分解决某些问题，包括在严重域偏移下'Tail'类别的灾难性崩溃。

Abstract: As most ''in the wild'' data collections of the natural world, the North
America Camera Trap Images (NACTI) dataset shows severe long-tailed class
imbalance, noting that the largest 'Head' class alone covers >50% of the 3.7M
images in the corpus. Building on the PyTorch Wildlife model, we present a
systematic study of Long-Tail Recognition methodologies for species recognition
on the NACTI dataset covering experiments on various LTR loss functions plus
LTR-sensitive regularisation. Our best configuration achieves 99.40% Top-1
accuracy on our NACTI test data split, substantially improving over a 95.51%
baseline using standard cross-entropy with Adam. This also improves on
previously reported top performance in MLWIC2 at 96.8% albeit using partly
unpublished (potentially different) partitioning, optimiser, and evaluation
protocols. To evaluate domain shifts (e.g. night-time captures, occlusion,
motion-blur) towards other datasets we construct a Reduced-Bias Test set from
the ENA-Detection dataset where our experimentally optimised long-tail enhanced
model achieves leading 52.55% accuracy (up from 51.20% with WCE loss),
demonstrating stronger generalisation capabilities under distribution shift. We
document the consistent improvements of LTR-enhancing scheduler choices in this
NACTI wildlife domain, particularly when in tandem with state-of-the-art LTR
losses. We finally discuss qualitative and quantitative shortcomings that LTR
methods cannot sufficiently address, including catastrophic breakdown for
'Tail' classes under severe domain shift. For maximum reproducibility we
publish all dataset splits, key code, and full network weights.

Motivation: 传统方法需要监督学习，需要提供不同类别的示例。本研究旨在开发无监督方法，仅基于相邻突触更相似的观察进行分类。

Method: 利用相邻突触在相同神经元中比随机选择的突触更相似的原理，应用在果蝇数据上，无需预先知道突触类型数量。

Result: 成功开发出无监督突触分类方法，能够自动识别突触类型，无需人工标注。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了无需预先知道突触类型数量的分类方案，并为选择涵盖突触结构范围的真实数据提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Separating synapses into different classes based on their appearance in EM
images has many applications in biology. Examples may include assigning a
neurotransmitter to a particular class, or separating synapses whose strength
can be modulated from those whose strength is fixed. Traditionally, this has
been done in a supervised manner, giving the classification algorithm examples
of the different classes. Here we instead separate synapses into classes based
only on the observation that nearby synapses in the same neuron are likely more
similar than synapses chosen randomly from different cells. We apply our
methodology to data from {\it Drosophila}. Our approach has the advantage that
the number of synapse types does not need to be known in advance. It may also
provide a principled way to select ground-truth that spans the range of synapse
structure.

TL;DR: 评估UNI和Virchow2两种基础模型作为特征提取器在皮肤病理学全玻片图像分类中的性能，使用平均聚合策略将补丁级特征聚合成玻片级特征，并通过多种机器学习分类器进行分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤病理学中全玻片图像的快速生成需要自动化方法进行高效处理和准确分类，本研究旨在评估基础模型在这一任务中的表现。

Method: 使用UNI和Virchow2模型提取补丁级嵌入特征，通过平均聚合策略生成玻片级特征，然后训练逻辑回归、梯度提升树和随机森林等分类器。

Result: Virchow2提取的特征在大多数玻片级分类器中优于UNI，逻辑回归在Virchow2上达到最高准确率90%，但差异无统计学意义。

Conclusion: 基础模型在自动化WSI分类中具有潜力，为皮肤病理学诊断提供了可扩展且有效的方法，并为玻片级表示学习的未来发展铺平了道路。

Abstract: The rapid generation of whole-slide images (WSIs) in dermatopathology
necessitates automated methods for efficient processing and accurate
classification. This study evaluates the performance of two foundation models,
UNI and Virchow2, as feature extractors for classifying WSIs into three
diagnostic categories: melanocytic, basaloid, and squamous lesions. Patch-level
embeddings were aggregated into slide-level features using a mean-aggregation
strategy and subsequently used to train multiple machine learning classifiers,
including logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, and random forest
models. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, true positive rate,
false positive rate, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUROC) on the test set. Results demonstrate that patch-level features
extracted using Virchow2 outperformed those extracted via UNI across most
slide-level classifiers, with logistic regression achieving the highest
accuracy (90%) for Virchow2, though the difference was not statistically
significant. The study also explored data augmentation techniques and image
normalization to enhance model robustness and generalizability. The
mean-aggregation approach provided reliable slide-level feature
representations. All experimental results and metrics were tracked and
visualized using WandB.ai, facilitating reproducibility and interpretability.
This research highlights the potential of foundation models for automated WSI
classification, providing a scalable and effective approach for
dermatopathological diagnosis while paving the way for future advancements in
slide-level representation learning.

Motivation: 解决生态学中因缺乏对黑盒神经网络模型的信任而阻碍计算机视觉应用的问题，通过可解释性方法为预测提供证据并记录部署限制。

Method: 使用Faster R-CNN检测海豹，并应用梯度类激活映射（HiResCAM、LayerCAM）、LIME和基于扰动的解释方法生成预测解释。

Conclusion: 通过将目标检测与后验可解释性结合，可以超越"黑盒"预测，开发出可审计、支持决策的生态保护监测工具。

Abstract: Computer vision can accelerate ecological research and conservation
monitoring, yet adoption in ecology lags in part because of a lack of trust in
black-box neural-network-based models. We seek to address this challenge by
applying post-hoc explanations to provide evidence for predictions and document
limitations that are important to field deployment. Using aerial imagery from
Glacier Bay National Park, we train a Faster R-CNN to detect pinnipeds (harbor
seals) and generate explanations via gradient-based class activation mapping
(HiResCAM, LayerCAM), local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME),
and perturbation-based explanations. We assess explanations along three axes
relevant to field use: (i) localization fidelity: whether high-attribution
regions coincide with the animal rather than background context; (ii)
faithfulness: whether deletion/insertion tests produce changes in detector
confidence; and (iii) diagnostic utility: whether explanations reveal
systematic failure modes. Explanations concentrate on seal torsos and contours
rather than surrounding ice/rock, and removal of the seals reduces detection
confidence, providing model-evidence for true positives. The analysis also
uncovers recurrent error sources, including confusion between seals and black
ice and rocks. We translate these findings into actionable next steps for model
development, including more targeted data curation and augmentation. By pairing
object detection with post-hoc explainability, we can move beyond "black-box"
predictions toward auditable, decision-supporting tools for conservation
monitoring.

TL;DR: BachVid是一种无需训练的方法，通过分析DiT的注意力机制和中间特征，实现多视频中角色和背景的一致性生成，无需参考图像或额外训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在生成多个视频时难以保持角色和背景一致性的问题，现有方法通常依赖参考图像或大量训练，且往往只关注角色一致性。

Method: 基于对DiT注意力机制和中间特征的系统分析，首先生成身份视频并缓存中间变量，然后将这些缓存变量注入到新生成视频的对应位置。

Result: 实验结果表明BachVid在无需额外训练的情况下实现了生成视频的稳健一致性。

Conclusion: BachVid提供了一种新颖高效的解决方案，无需依赖参考图像或额外训练即可实现一致性视频生成。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently driven significant progress in
text-to-video (T2V) generation. However, generating multiple videos with
consistent characters and backgrounds remains a significant challenge. Existing
methods typically rely on reference images or extensive training, and often
only address character consistency, leaving background consistency to
image-to-video models. We introduce BachVid, the first training-free method
that achieves consistent video generation without needing any reference images.
Our approach is based on a systematic analysis of DiT's attention mechanism and
intermediate features, revealing its ability to extract foreground masks and
identify matching points during the denoising process. Our method leverages
this finding by first generating an identity video and caching the intermediate
variables, and then inject these cached variables into corresponding positions
in newly generated videos, ensuring both foreground and background consistency
across multiple videos. Experimental results demonstrate that BachVid achieves
robust consistency in generated videos without requiring additional training,
offering a novel and efficient solution for consistent video generation without
relying on reference images or additional training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉扩散模型在几何问题求解中的潜力，将几何推理重新定义为图像生成任务。

Method: 将几何问题实例视为图像，训练标准视觉扩散模型从高斯噪声生成近似解图像，无需特殊架构或领域特定适配。

Result: 模型成功学习将噪声几何结构转换为正确配置，在多个著名几何问题上获得有效近似解。

Conclusion: 图像空间为近似困难几何问题提供了通用实用框架，为处理更广泛几何任务开辟了新途径。

Abstract: In this paper we show that visual diffusion models can serve as effective
geometric solvers: they can directly reason about geometric problems by working
in pixel space. We first demonstrate this on the Inscribed Square Problem, a
long-standing problem in geometry that asks whether every Jordan curve contains
four points forming a square. We then extend the approach to two other
well-known hard geometric problems: the Steiner Tree Problem and the Simple
Polygon Problem.
  Our method treats each problem instance as an image and trains a standard
visual diffusion model that transforms Gaussian noise into an image
representing a valid approximate solution that closely matches the exact one.
The model learns to transform noisy geometric structures into correct
configurations, effectively recasting geometric reasoning as image generation.
  Unlike prior work that necessitates specialized architectures and
domain-specific adaptations when applying diffusion to parametric geometric
representations, we employ a standard visual diffusion model that operates on
the visual representation of the problem. This simplicity highlights a
surprising bridge between generative modeling and geometric problem solving.
Beyond the specific problems studied here, our results point toward a broader
paradigm: operating in image space provides a general and practical framework
for approximating notoriously hard problems, and opens the door to tackling a
far wider class of challenging geometric tasks.

Abstract: When a vision model performs image recognition, which visual attributes drive
its predictions? Detecting unintended reliance on specific visual features is
critical for ensuring model robustness, preventing overfitting, and avoiding
spurious correlations. We introduce an automated framework for detecting such
dependencies in trained vision models. At the core of our method is a
self-reflective agent that systematically generates and tests hypotheses about
visual attributes that a model may rely on. This process is iterative: the
agent refines its hypotheses based on experimental outcomes and uses a
self-evaluation protocol to assess whether its findings accurately explain
model behavior. When inconsistencies arise, the agent self-reflects over its
findings and triggers a new cycle of experimentation. We evaluate our approach
on a novel benchmark of 130 models designed to exhibit diverse visual attribute
dependencies across 18 categories. Our results show that the agent's
performance consistently improves with self-reflection, with a significant
performance increase over non-reflective baselines. We further demonstrate that
the agent identifies real-world visual attribute dependencies in
state-of-the-art models, including CLIP's vision encoder and the YOLOv8 object
detector.

Abstract: Many high-stakes applications of AI require forming data-driven hypotheses
and making targeted guesses; e.g., in scientific and diagnostic settings. Given
limited resources, to what extent do agents based on language models (LMs) act
rationally? We develop methods to benchmark and enhance agentic
information-seeking, drawing on insights from human behavior. First, we
introduce a strategic decision-oriented dialogue task called Collaborative
Battleship, in which a partially-informed Captain must balance exploration
(asking questions) and action (taking shots), while a fully-informed Spotter
must provide accurate answers under an information bottleneck. Compared to
human players (N=42), we find that LM agents struggle to ground answers in
context, generate informative questions, and select high-value actions. Next,
to address these gaps, we develop novel Monte Carlo inference strategies for
LMs based on principles from Bayesian Experimental Design (BED). For Spotter
agents, our approach boosts accuracy by up to 14.7% absolute over LM-only
baselines; for Captain agents, it raises expected information gain (EIG) by up
to 0.227 bits (94.2% of the achievable noise ceiling). Combined, these
components yield sharper targeting (+0.303-0.374 F1), and enable weaker LMs,
such as Llama-4-Scout, to outperform both humans (8% -> 82% win rate) and
frontier models (0% -> 67% win rate vs. GPT-5) at ~1% of GPT-5's cost. We
replicate these findings on Guess Who? where our methods significantly boost
accuracy (+28.3-42.4 p.p.), demonstrating their general applicability for
building rational information-seeking agents.

Motivation: 推理模型虽然成功但训练成本高、运行缓慢，研究发现标准指令语言模型本身就具备强大的推理能力，无需额外训练。

Method: CodeAdapt方法结合CodeAct框架（语言模型交替进行自然语言推理和代码执行）和少样本引导学习，仅需5个训练问题即可实现。

Result: 在四个匹配的语言模型-推理模型对中，CodeAdapt使三个语言模型在八个任务上平均表现优于对应推理模型（最高提升22.9%），同时token效率提高10-81%。

Conclusion: CodeAdapt式学习和推理具有鲁棒性和领域通用性，代码增强的语言模型是认知基础良好且强大的系统，为权重内强化学习提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Reasoning models (RMs), language models (LMs) trained with reinforcement
learning to produce long-form natural language reasoning, have been remarkably
successful, but they still require large amounts of computation and data to
train, and can be slow and expensive to run. In this paper, we show that
standard instruct LMs can already be elicited to be strong reasoners at a level
comparable to or even surpassing their corresponding RMs (e.g., DeepSeek V3 vs
R1) without finetuning, across diverse domains from instruction following and
creative generation to mathematical reasoning. This is achieved by CodeAdapt,
our simple recipe that combines the CodeAct framework, where LMs interleave
natural language reasoning with code execution in a multi-step fashion, with
few-shot bootstrap in-context learning from as few as five training problems.
Analyzing four matched pairs of LMs and RMs, we find that CodeAdapt enables
three LMs to outperform the corresponding RMs on average over eight tasks (up
to 22.9%) while being 10-81% more token efficient, and delivers superior
performance on six tasks when averaged over the four models (up to 35.7%).
Furthermore, the code-augmented reasoning traces display rich and varied
problem-solving strategies. Our findings support that (1) CodeAdapt-style
learning and reasoning may be robust and domain general and (2) code-enabled
LMs are cognitively grounded and powerful systems, potentially providing a
strong foundation for in-weight reinforcement learning.

Motivation: 由于长文本细粒度标注成本高和公共领域文学数据污染问题，评估语言模型在计算文学研究中的实用性具有挑战性。现有嵌入相似性数据集不适合文学领域任务。

Method: 构建FICSIM数据集，包含长篇现代小说，基于作者提供的元数据在12个相似性维度上进行评分，并由数字人文学者验证。评估了一系列嵌入模型在该任务上的表现。

Result: 研究发现模型普遍倾向于关注表面特征，而不是对计算文学研究有用的语义类别。

Conclusion: 需要开发更注重语义理解的嵌入模型来支持计算文学研究，同时在数据收集过程中优先考虑作者权益和知情同意。

Abstract: As language models become capable of processing increasingly long and complex
texts, there has been growing interest in their application within
computational literary studies. However, evaluating the usefulness of these
models for such tasks remains challenging due to the cost of fine-grained
annotation for long-form texts and the data contamination concerns inherent in
using public-domain literature. Current embedding similarity datasets are not
suitable for evaluating literary-domain tasks because of a focus on
coarse-grained similarity and primarily on very short text. We assemble and
release FICSIM, a dataset of long-form, recently written fiction, including
scores along 12 axes of similarity informed by author-produced metadata and
validated by digital humanities scholars. We evaluate a suite of embedding
models on this task, demonstrating a tendency across models to focus on
surface-level features over semantic categories that would be useful for
computational literary studies tasks. Throughout our data-collection process,
we prioritize author agency and rely on continual, informed author consent.

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型长上下文评估大多依赖简化的合成任务，无法反映真实世界文档理解的复杂性。推翻关系是普通法体系的基础，为评估长文档法律理解提供了重要测试平台。

Method: 使用236对案例的数据集，评估最先进的大语言模型识别美国最高法院案例中的推翻关系的能力。

Result: 评估揭示了三个关键局限性：1) 时代敏感性 - 模型对历史案例表现较差，显示训练中存在时间偏见；2) 浅层推理 - 模型依赖浅层逻辑启发式而非深度法律理解；3) 上下文依赖的推理失败 - 在复杂开放任务中产生时间上不可能的关系。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了一个解决现实长上下文评估关键差距的基准，创建了反映实际法律推理任务复杂性和重要性的评估环境。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows show promise for
complex legal reasoning tasks, yet their ability to understand long legal
documents remains insufficiently evaluated. Developing long-context benchmarks
that capture realistic, high-stakes tasks remains a significant challenge in
the field, as most existing evaluations rely on simplified synthetic tasks that
fail to represent the complexity of real-world document understanding.
Overruling relationships are foundational to common-law doctrine and commonly
found in judicial opinions. They provide a focused and important testbed for
long-document legal understanding that closely resembles what legal
professionals actually do. We present an assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs on
identifying overruling relationships from U.S. Supreme Court cases using a
dataset of 236 case pairs. Our evaluation reveals three critical limitations:
(1) era sensitivity -- the models show degraded performance on historical cases
compared to modern ones, revealing fundamental temporal bias in their training;
(2) shallow reasoning -- models rely on shallow logical heuristics rather than
deep legal comprehension; and (3) context-dependent reasoning failures --
models produce temporally impossible relationships in complex open-ended tasks
despite maintaining basic temporal awareness in simple contexts. Our work
contributes a benchmark that addresses the critical gap in realistic
long-context evaluation, providing an environment that mirrors the complexity
and stakes of actual legal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We present Irish-BLiMP (Irish Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs), the
first dataset and framework designed for fine-grained evaluation of linguistic
competence in the Irish language, an endangered language. Drawing on a variety
of linguistic literature and grammar reference works, we manually constructed
and reviewed 1020 minimal pairs across a taxonomy of 11 linguistic features,
through a team of fluent Irish speakers. We evaluate both existing Large
Language Models (LLMs) and fluent human participants on their syntactic
knowledge of Irish. Our findings show that humans outperform all models across
all linguistic features, achieving 16.6% higher accuracy on average. Moreover,
a substantial performance gap of 18.1% persists between open- and closed-source
LLMs, with even the strongest model (gpt-5) reaching only 73.5% accuracy
compared to 90.1% by human. Interestingly, human participants and models
struggle on different aspects of Irish grammar, thus highlighting a difference
in representation learned by the models. Overall, Irish-BLiMP provides the
first systematic framework for evaluating the grammatical competence of LLMs in
Irish and offers a valuable benchmark for advancing research on linguistic
understanding in low-resource languages.

Motivation: 思维链提示虽然能提升复杂任务的准确性，但经常不必要且大幅增加token使用量，限制了推理模型的实际应用。需要确定何时应该使用思维链。

Method: 使用四种无需训练的置信度估计方法来控制思维链的调用，比较随机基线和知道何时需要思维链的oracle方法。

Conclusion: 置信度门控思维链有潜力但存在局限性，当前方法的可靠性不足，需要开发更可靠的自适应思维链门控方法。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a common technique for
enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). While
extended reasoning can boost accuracy on complex tasks, it is often unnecessary
and substantially increases token usage, limiting the practicality of reasoning
models in many scenarios. Recent models, such as GPT-OSS and Qwen3, expose
controls that enable users to adjust the length of CoT or determine whether it
is used at all. Yet, it remains unclear when CoT should be used: on some tasks
it improves performance, while on others it provides little benefit or even
harms performance. We address this challenge with confidence-gated CoT, where a
model invokes reasoning only when confidence in its direct answer is low. To
this end, we present the first systematic study of training-free confidence
estimation methods for CoT gating. Specifically, we evaluate four training-free
confidence estimation methods and compare them to a random baseline and an
oracle that always knows when CoT is needed. Through extensive experiments, we
show that existing training-free confidence measures can reduce redundant CoT
and outperform randomly invoked CoT. However, the utility of individual
confidence measures is inconsistent, varying with both the dataset and the
model, underscoring the difficulty of deploying confidence-gated CoT in
practice. By analysing both strengths and failure modes, our study highlights
the potential and limitations of current methods and paves the way toward more
reliable adaptive gating of CoT.

Motivation: 在体育报道等准确性要求高的领域部署LLM时，生成的文本可能无法忠实反映输入数据，需要量化输入结构对事实错误的影响。

Method: 使用三种输入格式（行结构、JSON和非结构化）生成NBA比赛摘要，手动标注3,312个事实错误，涉及两个模型（Llama-3.1-70B和Qwen2.5-72B）的180个游戏摘要。

Result: 输入结构对错误率有显著影响：JSON输入相比非结构化输入，Llama错误率减少69%，Qwen减少65%；行结构输入分别减少54%和51%。方差分析显示输入结构解释了80%以上的错误率方差。

Conclusion: 输入数据结构对LLM生成摘要的事实准确性有决定性影响，结构化格式特别是JSON能显著减少事实错误。

Abstract: A major concern when deploying LLMs in accuracy-critical domains such as
sports reporting is that the generated text may not faithfully reflect the
input data. We quantify how input structure affects hallucinations and other
factual errors in LLM-generated summaries of NBA play-by-play data, across
three formats: row-structured, JSON and unstructured. We manually annotated
3,312 factual errors across 180 game summaries produced by two models,
Llama-3.1-70B and Qwen2.5-72B. Input structure has a strong effect: JSON input
reduces error rates by 69% for Llama and 65% for Qwen compared to unstructured
input, while row-structured input reduces errors by 54% for Llama and 51% for
Qwen. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA shows that input structure accounts for
over 80% of the variance in error rates, with Tukey HSD post hoc tests
confirming statistically significant differences between all input formats.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究首次系统分析了在低误报率要求下推理对分类任务的影响，发现推理增强方法在整体准确率上有优势，但在严格精度要求下表现不佳，而无需推理的方法在精度敏感场景中更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理已成为大语言模型的核心范式，能提升各种基准测试的准确率，但其在精度敏感任务中的适用性尚不明确，特别是在低误报率要求下的表现需要系统研究。

Method: 研究覆盖安全检测和幻觉检测两个任务，在微调和零样本设置下评估标准LLM和大推理模型，比较推理增强（Think On）和无推理（Think Off）两种模式，并分析基于token的评分与自述置信度的差异。

Result: 推理增强方法提高整体准确率但在低误报率阈值下表现不佳；无推理方法在精度敏感场景中占优；基于token的评分显著优于自述置信度；两种模式的简单集成能结合各自优势。

Conclusion: 推理是一把双刃剑：对平均准确率有益，但通常不适合需要严格精度的应用场景。

Abstract: Reasoning has become a central paradigm for large language models (LLMs),
consistently boosting accuracy across diverse benchmarks. Yet its suitability
for precision-sensitive tasks remains unclear. We present the first systematic
study of reasoning for classification tasks under strict low false positive
rate (FPR) regimes. Our analysis covers two tasks--safety detection and
hallucination detection--evaluated in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings,
using standard LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Our results reveal a
clear trade-off: Think On (reasoning-augmented) generation improves overall
accuracy, but underperforms at the low-FPR thresholds essential for practical
use. In contrast, Think Off (no reasoning during inference) dominates in these
precision-sensitive regimes, with Think On surpassing only when higher FPRs are
acceptable. In addition, we find token-based scoring substantially outperforms
self-verbalized confidence for precision-sensitive deployments. Finally, a
simple ensemble of the two modes recovers the strengths of each. Taken
together, our findings position reasoning as a double-edged tool: beneficial
for average accuracy, but often ill-suited for applications requiring strict
precision.

TL;DR: DR-IKE是一个轻量级框架，通过动态检索和修剪演示来改进上下文知识编辑，无需修改模型权重，兼容黑盒LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前基于静态演示集的知识编辑器存在的数量-质量权衡问题和缺乏任务难度适应性的问题。

Method: 训练BERT检索器使用REINFORCE算法按编辑奖励对演示进行排序，并采用可学习阈值修剪低价值示例，根据任务难度动态调整提示长度。

Result: 在COUNTERFACT基准测试中，编辑成功率提高17.1%，延迟降低41.6%，同时保持无关查询的准确性。

Conclusion: DR-IKE展示了可扩展和自适应的知识编辑能力，为黑盒LLM提供了有效的梯度无关编辑解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at factual recall yet still propagate
stale or incorrect knowledge. In-context knowledge editing offers a
gradient-free remedy suitable for black-box APIs, but current editors rely on
static demonstration sets chosen by surface-level similarity, leading to two
persistent obstacles: (i) a quantity-quality trade-off, and (ii) lack of
adaptivity to task difficulty. We address these issues by dynamically selecting
supporting demonstrations according to their utility for the edit. We propose
Dynamic Retriever for In-Context Knowledge Editing (DR-IKE), a lightweight
framework that (1) trains a BERT retriever with REINFORCE to rank
demonstrations by editing reward, and (2) employs a learnable threshold to
prune low-value examples, shortening the prompt when the edit is easy and
expanding it when the task is hard. DR-IKE performs editing without modifying
model weights, relying solely on forward passes for compatibility with
black-box LLMs. On the COUNTERFACT benchmark, it improves edit success by up to
17.1%, reduces latency by 41.6%, and preserves accuracy on unrelated queries,
demonstrating scalable and adaptive knowledge editing. The code is available at

Motivation: 解决当前问答系统在英语之外的资源匮乏语言（如印尼语）中性能不足的问题，弥合语言差距。

Method: 采用自适应RAG系统，集成问题复杂度分类器，根据问题复杂度选择回答策略，并使用机器翻译进行数据增强以克服印尼语数据集有限的挑战。

Result: 问题复杂度分类器表现可靠，但多检索回答策略存在显著不一致性，对整体评估产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 研究展示了在资源匮乏语言中问答系统的潜力和挑战，为未来改进指明了方向。

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) has seen significant improvements with the
advancement of machine learning models, further studies enhanced this question
answering system by retrieving external information, called Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) to produce more accurate and informative answers. However,
these state-of-the-art-performance is predominantly in English language. To
address this gap we made an effort of bridging language gaps by incorporating
Adaptive RAG system to Indonesian language. Adaptive RAG system integrates a
classifier whose task is to distinguish the question complexity, which in turn
determines the strategy for answering the question. To overcome the limited
availability of Indonesian language dataset, our study employs machine
translation as data augmentation approach. Experiments show reliable question
complexity classifier; however, we observed significant inconsistencies in
multi-retrieval answering strategy which negatively impacted the overall
evaluation when this strategy was applied. These findings highlight both the
promise and challenges of question answering in low-resource language
suggesting directions for future improvement.

Motivation: 智能药物推荐系统对提高临床决策质量至关重要，但缺乏公开可用的真实世界电子健康记录数据集，特别是在非英语语言中。

Method: 构建了包含3,190名患者5,894条记录的CDrugRed数据集，包含患者人口统计、病史、临床过程和出院诊断等信息，并基于该数据集对多种大语言模型进行基准测试。

Result: 实验结果显示，虽然监督微调能提升模型性能，但仍有很大改进空间，最佳模型的F1分数为0.5648，Jaccard分数为0.4477。

Conclusion: 临床药物推荐任务具有复杂性，CDrugRed数据集为开发更鲁棒和准确的药物推荐系统提供了具有挑战性和价值的资源。

Abstract: Intelligent drug recommendation based on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is
critical for improving for improving the quality and efficiency of clinical
decision-making. By leveraging large-scale patient data, drug recommendation
systems can assist physicians in selecting the most appropriate medications
according to a patient's medical history, diagnoses, laboratory results, and
comorbidities. However, the advancement of such systems is significantly
hampered by the scarcity of publicly available, real-world EHR datasets,
particularly in languages other than English. In this work, we present
CDrugRed, a first publicly available Chinese drug recommendation dataset
focused on discharge medications for metabolic diseases. The dataset includes
5,894 de-identified records from 3,190 patients, containing comprehensive
information such as patient demographics, medical history, clinical course, and
discharge diagnoses. We assess the utility of CDrugRed by benchmarking several
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on the discharge medication
recommendation task. Experimental results show that while supervised
fine-tuning improves model performance, there remains substantial room for
improvement, with the best model achieving the F1 score of 0.5648 and Jaccard
score of 0.4477. This result highlights the complexity of the clinical drug
recommendation task and establishes CDrugRed as a challenging and valuable
resource for developing more robust and accurate drug recommendation systems.

TL;DR: 提出Self-Rewarding PPO方法，结合SFT和PPO的优势，通过自奖励机制改进LLM对齐效果，无需人工偏好标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SFT方法存在过拟合和泛化能力差的问题，特别是在数据有限的情况下。

Method: 使用SFT模型与预训练基模型的策略对数比作为奖励函数，结合PPO进行在线策略微调。

Result: 在多个NLP任务上的实验表明，该方法持续优于传统SFT方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效利用演示数据对齐LLM，特别是在高质量标注数据稀缺的情况下表现优异。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has emerged as a crucial method for aligning
large language models (LLMs) with human-annotated demonstrations. However, SFT,
being an off-policy approach similar to behavior cloning, often struggles with
overfitting and poor out-of-domain generalization, especially in limited-data
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Rewarding PPO, a novel
fine-tuning method that leverages on-policy techniques to enhance
generalization performance. Our approach combines the strengths of SFT and
proximal policy optimization (PPO) to achieve more effective alignment from
demonstration data. At its core is a reward function designed as the log policy
ratio between the SFT model and the pretrained base model. This function serves
as an implicit reward signal, using the pretrained policy as a baseline and the
SFT policy as a target. By doing so, it enables on-policy fine-tuning without
relying on human preference annotations. The integration of this self-rewarding
mechanism with PPO addresses key limitations of SFT, improving generalization,
data efficiency, and robustness. Our empirical evaluation across a range of
natural language processing tasks demonstrates that Self-Rewarding PPO
consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods. The results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in aligning LLMs using demonstration data,
particularly in scenarios where high-quality annotated data is scarce.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有摘要忠实度基准存在标注模糊问题，主要是由于生成输出中允许使用外部知识的边界不明确，导致标注不一致。

Method: 提出新的忠实度标注框架，引入中间类别Out-Dependent来分类需要外部知识验证的情况，并构建VeriGray基准。

Result: 统计显示SOTA LLM在摘要任务中仍存在约6%的幻觉，约8%的生成句子属于Out-Dependent类别，基准对多种基线方法构成显著挑战。

Conclusion: 解决标注模糊对于不忠实检测基准至关重要，当前方法仍有很大改进空间。

Abstract: Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) generate summaries faithful to a
given source document is essential for real-world applications. While prior
research has explored LLM faithfulness, existing benchmarks suffer from
annotation ambiguity, primarily due to the ill-defined boundary of permissible
external knowledge in generated outputs. For instance, common sense is often
incorporated into responses and labeled as "faithful", yet the acceptable
extent of such knowledge remains unspecified, leading to inconsistent
annotations. To address this issue, we propose a novel faithfulness annotation
framework, which introduces an intermediate category, Out-Dependent, to
classify cases where external knowledge is required for verification. Using
this framework, we construct VeriGray (Verification with the Gray Zone) -- a
new unfaithfulness detection benchmark in summarization. Statistics reveal that
even SOTA LLMs, such as GPT-5, exhibit hallucinations ($\sim 6\%$ of sentences)
in summarization tasks. Moreover, a substantial proportion ($\sim 8\%$ on
average of models) of generated sentences fall into the Out-Dependent category,
underscoring the importance of resolving annotation ambiguity in unfaithfulness
detection benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that our benchmark poses
significant challenges to multiple baseline methods, indicating considerable
room for future improvement.

Method: 提出了一个新颖的分类体系，包括两个基本方向：LLM for TAG（LLMs丰富图任务）和TAG for LLM（图结构改进LLM推理）。将编排策略分为顺序、并行和多模块框架，并讨论了TAG特定的预训练、提示和参数高效微调方法。

Result: 总结了实证见解，整理了可用数据集，并展示了在推荐系统、生物医学分析和知识密集型问答等领域的多样化应用。

Conclusion: LLM与TAG的集成在语言和图学习的交叉领域具有重要价值，论文为未来研究提供了系统指导，并指出了开放挑战和前景研究方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural
language processing through strong semantic understanding and generation.
However, their black-box nature limits structured and multi-hop reasoning. In
contrast, Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) provide explicit relational structures
enriched with textual context, yet often lack semantic depth. Recent research
shows that combining LLMs and TAGs yields complementary benefits: enhancing TAG
representation learning and improving the reasoning and interpretability of
LLMs. This survey provides the first systematic review of LLM--TAG integration
from an orchestration perspective. We introduce a novel taxonomy covering two
fundamental directions: LLM for TAG, where LLMs enrich graph-based tasks, and
TAG for LLM, where structured graphs improve LLM reasoning. We categorize
orchestration strategies into sequential, parallel, and multi-module
frameworks, and discuss advances in TAG-specific pretraining, prompting, and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Beyond methodology, we summarize empirical
insights, curate available datasets, and highlight diverse applications across
recommendation systems, biomedical analysis, and knowledge-intensive question
answering. Finally, we outline open challenges and promising research
directions, aiming to guide future work at the intersection of language and
graph learning.

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了LLM在社交模拟中的行为偏差，发现LLM无法忠实再现真实人类行为，而是反映过度理想化的版本，存在社会角色偏见、首因效应和积极性偏见，导致形成缺乏真实人类互动复杂性的"乌托邦"社会。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在模拟人类行为方面显示出潜力，但它们在社交情境中与真实人类行为的差异程度尚未充分探索，这可能在科学研究和实际应用中导致误解和意外后果。

Method: 提出系统框架分析LLM在社交模拟中的行为，通过聊天室式对话模拟多智能体互动，并在五个语言维度上进行分析，以检验涌现的社会认知偏见。

Result: 实验涉及三个家族的八个代表性LLM，发现LLM表现出社会角色偏见、首因效应和积极性偏见，形成缺乏真实人类互动复杂性的"乌托邦"社会。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁开发更具社会基础的LLM，以捕捉人类社交行为的多样性。

Abstract: Reliable simulation of human behavior is essential for explaining,
predicting, and intervening in our society. Recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) have shown promise in emulating human behaviors, interactions,
and decision-making, offering a powerful new lens for social science studies.
However, the extent to which LLMs diverge from authentic human behavior in
social contexts remains underexplored, posing risks of misinterpretation in
scientific studies and unintended consequences in real-world applications.
Here, we introduce a systematic framework for analyzing LLMs' behavior in
social simulation. Our approach simulates multi-agent interactions through
chatroom-style conversations and analyzes them across five linguistic
dimensions, providing a simple yet effective method to examine emergent social
cognitive biases. We conduct extensive experiments involving eight
representative LLMs across three families. Our findings reveal that LLMs do not
faithfully reproduce genuine human behavior but instead reflect overly
idealized versions of it, shaped by the social desirability bias. In
particular, LLMs show social role bias, primacy effect, and positivity bias,
resulting in "Utopian" societies that lack the complexity and variability of
real human interactions. These findings call for more socially grounded LLMs
that capture the diversity of human social behavior.

Abstract: The availability of LLM benchmarks for the Estonian language is limited, and
a comprehensive evaluation comparing the performance of different LLMs on
Estonian tasks has yet to be conducted. We introduce a new benchmark for
evaluating LLMs in Estonian, based on seven diverse datasets. These datasets
assess general and domain-specific knowledge, understanding of Estonian grammar
and vocabulary, summarization abilities, contextual comprehension, and more.
The datasets are all generated from native Estonian sources without using
machine translation. We compare the performance of base models,
instruction-tuned open-source models, and commercial models. Our evaluation
includes 6 base models and 26 instruction-tuned models. To assess the results,
we employ both human evaluation and LLM-as-a-judge methods. Human evaluation
scores showed moderate to high correlation with benchmark evaluations,
depending on the dataset. Claude 3.7 Sonnet, used as an LLM judge, demonstrated
strong alignment with human ratings, indicating that top-performing LLMs can
effectively support the evaluation of Estonian-language models.

Abstract: Objective: Emergency medical dispatch (EMD) is a high-stakes process
challenged by caller distress, ambiguity, and cognitive load. Large Language
Models (LLMs) and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) offer opportunities to augment
dispatchers. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a taxonomy-grounded,
LLM-powered multi-agent system for simulating realistic EMD scenarios. Methods:
We constructed a clinical taxonomy (32 chief complaints, 6 caller identities
from MIMIC-III) and a six-phase call protocol. Using this framework, we
developed an AutoGen-based MAS with Caller and Dispatcher Agents. The system
grounds interactions in a fact commons to ensure clinical plausibility and
mitigate misinformation. We used a hybrid evaluation framework: four physicians
assessed 100 simulated cases for "Guidance Efficacy" and "Dispatch
Effectiveness," supplemented by automated linguistic analysis (sentiment,
readability, politeness). Results: Human evaluation, with substantial
inter-rater agreement (Gwe's AC1 > 0.70), confirmed the system's high
performance. It demonstrated excellent Dispatch Effectiveness (e.g., 94 %
contacting the correct potential other agents) and Guidance Efficacy (advice
provided in 91 % of cases), both rated highly by physicians. Algorithmic
metrics corroborated these findings, indicating a predominantly neutral
affective profile (73.7 % neutral sentiment; 90.4 % neutral emotion), high
readability (Flesch 80.9), and a consistently polite style (60.0 % polite; 0 %
impolite). Conclusion: Our taxonomy-grounded MAS simulates diverse, clinically
plausible dispatch scenarios with high fidelity. Findings support its use for
dispatcher training, protocol evaluation, and as a foundation for real-time
decision support. This work outlines a pathway for safely integrating advanced
AI agents into emergency response workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估指标强调局部预测准确性但忽视长程结构复杂性，无法解释LLM即使困惑度低时仍出现重复和不连贯等令人困惑的行为。

Method: 引入相关维度作为自相似性度量，捕捉语言的分层递归结构，在统一框架中桥接局部和全局属性。

Result: 相关维度能够：(1)揭示预训练中的三个不同阶段；(2)反映上下文依赖的复杂性；(3)指示模型产生幻觉的倾向；(4)可靠检测生成文本中的多种退化形式。

Conclusion: 该方法计算高效，对模型量化鲁棒，适用于多种自回归架构，为LLM的生成动态提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in natural
language generation, yet they continue to display puzzling behaviors -- such as
repetition and incoherence -- even when exhibiting low perplexity. This
highlights a key limitation of conventional evaluation metrics, which emphasize
local prediction accuracy while overlooking long-range structural complexity.
We introduce correlation dimension, a fractal-geometric measure of
self-similarity, to quantify the epistemological complexity of text as
perceived by a language model. This measure captures the hierarchical
recurrence structure of language, bridging local and global properties in a
unified framework. Through extensive experiments, we show that correlation
dimension (1) reveals three distinct phases during pretraining, (2) reflects
context-dependent complexity, (3) indicates a model's tendency toward
hallucination, and (4) reliably detects multiple forms of degeneration in
generated text. The method is computationally efficient, robust to model
quantization (down to 4-bit precision), broadly applicable across
autoregressive architectures (e.g., Transformer and Mamba), and provides fresh
insight into the generative dynamics of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制的O(N^2)复杂度限制了LLM的上下文长度扩展，而注意力矩阵通常是稀疏的，特别是对于长序列，这为优化提供了机会。

Method: 提出PBS-Attn方法，将序列划分为块，并利用注意力的置换特性来增加块级稀疏性，减少计算冗余。

Result: 在真实世界长上下文数据集上的实验表明，PBS-Attn在模型准确性上优于现有块稀疏注意力方法，并接近完整注意力基线，预填充端到端加速达2.75倍。

Conclusion: PBS-Attn是一种即插即用的方法，能够有效提升LLM长上下文预填充的计算效率，具有实际可行性。

Abstract: Scaling the context length of large language models (LLMs) offers significant
benefits but is computationally expensive. This expense stems primarily from
the self-attention mechanism, whose $O(N^2)$ complexity with respect to
sequence length presents a major bottleneck for both memory and latency.
Fortunately, the attention matrix is often sparse, particularly for long
sequences, suggesting an opportunity for optimization. Block-sparse attention
has emerged as a promising solution that partitions sequences into blocks and
skips computation for a subset of these blocks. However, the effectiveness of
this method is highly dependent on the underlying attention patterns, which can
lead to sub-optimal block-level sparsity. For instance, important key tokens
for queries within a single block may be scattered across numerous other
blocks, leading to computational redundancy. In this work, we propose Permuted
Block-Sparse Attention (\textbf{PBS-Attn}), a plug-and-play method that
leverages the permutation properties of attention to increase block-level
sparsity and enhance the computational efficiency of LLM prefilling. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on challenging real-world long-context datasets,
demonstrating that PBS-Attn consistently outperforms existing block-sparse
attention methods in model accuracy and closely matches the full attention
baseline. Powered by our custom permuted-FlashAttention kernels, PBS-Attn
achieves an end-to-end speedup of up to $2.75\times$ in long-context
prefilling, confirming its practical viability. Code available at

### [93] [PARL: Prompt-based Agents for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21306)
*Yarik Menchaca Resendiz,Roman Klinger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PARL是一种使用大语言模型作为强化学习代理的方法，通过提示而非微调，在非语言任务中实现强化学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要评估LLMs在依赖语言表示的任务中表现，但缺乏对结构化、非语言推理任务（如网格世界位置解释）的研究。

Method: PARL通过提示将动作、状态和奖励编码，使LLM能够通过试错交互进行学习，无需微调。

Result: 在简单环境中，PARL能够匹配或超越传统强化学习代理，但在需要复杂数学运算或状态动作解码的任务中存在性能限制。

Conclusion: LLMs可以作为强化学习代理，在简单非语言任务中表现良好，但在复杂任务中仍有局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated high performance on tasks
expressed in natural language, particularly in zero- or few-shot settings.
These are typically framed as supervised (e.g., classification) or unsupervised
(e.g., clustering) problems. However, limited work evaluates LLMs as agents in
reinforcement learning (RL) tasks (e.g., playing games), where learning occurs
through interaction with an environment and a reward system. While prior work
focused on representing tasks that rely on a language representation, we study
structured, non-linguistic reasoning - such as interpreting positions in a grid
world. We therefore introduce PARL (Prompt-based Agent for Reinforcement
Learning), a method that uses LLMs as RL agents through prompting, without any
fine-tuning. PARL encodes actions, states, and rewards in the prompt, enabling
the model to learn through trial-and-error interaction. We evaluate PARL on
three standard RL tasks that do not entirely rely on natural language. We show
that it can match or outperform traditional RL agents in simple environments by
leveraging pretrained knowledge. However, we identify performance limitations
in tasks that require complex mathematical operations or decoding states and
actions.

### [94] [Efficient semantic uncertainty quantification in language models via diversity-steered sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21310)
*Ji Won Park,Kyunghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种多样性导向的采样器，通过注入语义相似度惩罚来减少冗余输出，提高不确定性估计的样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自由形式问答中准确估计LLM的语义偶然和认知不确定性具有挑战性，传统方法需要大量昂贵的生成样本。

Method: 使用NLI模型在解码过程中注入连续语义相似度惩罚，涵盖自回归和掩码扩散范式，并通过重要性重加权和方差缩减技术优化不确定性估计。

Result: 在四个QA基准测试中，该方法在相同样本数量下覆盖更多语义簇，性能匹配或超越基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架模块化且无需访问基础LLM梯度，可作为风险敏感模型部署中不确定性估计的即插即用增强方案。

Abstract: Accurately estimating semantic aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in large
language models (LLMs) is particularly challenging in free-form question
answering (QA), where obtaining stable estimates often requires many expensive
generations. We introduce a diversity-steered sampler that discourages
semantically redundant outputs during decoding, covers both autoregressive and
masked diffusion paradigms, and yields substantial sample-efficiency gains. The
key idea is to inject a continuous semantic-similarity penalty into the model's
proposal distribution using a natural language inference (NLI) model lightly
finetuned on partial prefixes or intermediate diffusion states. We debias
downstream uncertainty estimates with importance reweighting and shrink their
variance with control variates. Across four QA benchmarks, our method matches
or surpasses baselines while covering more semantic clusters with the same
number of samples. Being modular and requiring no gradient access to the base
LLM, the framework promises to serve as a drop-in enhancement for uncertainty
estimation in risk-sensitive model deployments.

### [95] [Typoglycemia under the Hood: Investigating Language Models' Understanding of Scrambled Words](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21326)
*Gianluca Sperduti,Alejandro Moreo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究英语语言中typoglycemia现象（字母内部顺序打乱但单词仍可识别），分析模型对此类扭曲的鲁棒性原因，发现主要是由于英语中真正混淆的单词较少且上下文差异明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究为何NLP模型在单词内部字母顺序打乱时仍能保持良好性能，特别是当不同单词（如form和from）在typoglycemia下会变成相同表示时，模型如何解决这种歧义。

Method: 分析英国国家语料库量化单词混淆情况；评估BERT在区分混淆形式的能力；通过对比在干净文本和typoglycemic文本上训练的BERT变体进行探测实验。

Result: 研究发现英语中真正混淆的单词数量相对较少，且混淆单词的上下文差异显著，使得消歧变得简单；字母打乱导致的性能下降比预期要小。

Conclusion: 模型对typoglycemia的鲁棒性主要源于英语语言本身的特性——混淆单词数量有限且上下文差异明显，而非模型本身的特殊能力。

Abstract: Research in linguistics has shown that humans can read words with internally
scrambled letters, a phenomenon recently dubbed typoglycemia. Some specific NLP
models have recently been proposed that similarly demonstrate robustness to
such distortions by ignoring the internal order of characters by design. This
raises a fundamental question: how can models perform well when many distinct
words (e.g., form and from) collapse into identical representations under
typoglycemia? Our work, focusing exclusively on the English language, seeks to
shed light on the underlying aspects responsible for this robustness. We
hypothesize that the main reasons have to do with the fact that (i) relatively
few English words collapse under typoglycemia, and that (ii) collapsed words
tend to occur in contexts so distinct that disambiguation becomes trivial. In
our analysis, we (i) analyze the British National Corpus to quantify word
collapse and ambiguity under typoglycemia, (ii) evaluate BERT's ability to
disambiguate collapsing forms, and (iii) conduct a probing experiment by
comparing variants of BERT trained from scratch on clean versus typoglycemic
Wikipedia text; our results reveal that the performance degradation caused by
scrambling is smaller than expected.

*Priyanshu Karmakar,Soumyabrata Chaudhuri,Shubhojit Mallick,Manish Gupta,Abhik Jana,Shreya Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TripTide是首个评估LLM在现实旅行中断情况下重新规划行程能力的基准测试，通过多维度评估显示LLM在保持序列一致性和语义稳定性方面表现良好，但随着行程长度增加，处理中断的能力会下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有旅行规划系统如TripCraft和TravelPlanner虽然能生成个性化行程，但无法有效应对现实旅行中的各种中断情况，需要评估LLM在行程修订方面的能力。

Method: 提出TripTide基准测试，从三个维度评估：自动指标（意图保持、响应性、适应性）、LLM作为评判员的自动评估、专家手动评估语义、空间、序列和响应方面的质量。

Result: LLM在保持序列一致性和语义稳定性方面表现强劲，空间偏差在短途旅行中较大但随行程延长而减小，但处理中断的能力随行程长度增加而下降。

Conclusion: TripTide为评估LLM在现实不确定性下的旅行规划适应性、个性化和韧性建立了基准，揭示了LLM在长行程中断处理方面的局限性。

Abstract: Recent efforts like TripCraft and TravelPlanner have advanced the use of
Large Language Models ( LLMs) for personalized, constraint aware travel
itinerary generation. Yet, real travel often faces disruptions. To address
this, we present TripTide, the first benchmark evaluating LLM's ability to
revise itineraries under realistic disruptions. TripTide models key dimensions
such as disruption severity and traveler tolerance, enabling nuanced assessment
of LLM adaptability to events like flight cancellations, weather closures, or
overbooked attractions. We conduct a threefold evaluation. First, we introduce
automatic metrics including Preservation of Intent (how well the revised plan
maintains feasibility and goals), Responsiveness (promptness and
appropriateness of disruption handling), and Adaptability (semantic, spatial,
and sequential divergence between original and revised plans). Second, we apply
an LLM-as-a-judge approach to automatically assess revision quality. Third, we
perform manual expert evaluation to verify whether revisions preserve semantic,
spatial, sequential, and responsive aspects. Our experiments show that LLMs
maintain strong sequential consistency and semantic stability, while spatial
deviations are larger for shorter trips but decrease with longer ones,
indicating that extended plans encourage better geographic coherence. However,
disruption-handling ability declines as plan length increases, highlighting
limits in LLM robustness. TripTide establishes a benchmark for evaluating
adaptability, personalization, and resilience in LLM-based travel planning
under real-world uncertainty.

*Qiang Liu,Wuganjing Song,Zhenzhou Lin,Feifan Chen,Qiaolong Cai,Chen Li,Yongduo Sui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现单轮训练在推理任务中比多轮训练更有效，单轮训练的模型能良好泛化到单轮和多轮评估，而多轮训练会显著降低单轮推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM通常通过单轮强化学习开发推理能力，但实际应用涉及多轮人机交互，存在训练与部署条件不匹配的问题。

Method: 比较传统单轮训练与三种多轮策略，评估模型在单轮和多轮设置下的表现。

Result: 单轮训练模型在单轮和多轮评估中都表现良好，而多轮训练模型在单轮推理性能上显著下降。

Conclusion: 对于信息完整的任务，稳健的单轮训练比多轮训练更有效可靠，基础反馈的多轮训练收益有限且可能损害推理能力。

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically
developed through the single-turn reinforcement learning, whereas real-world
applications often involve multi-turn interactions with human feedback, leading
to a potential mismatch between training and deployment conditions. In this
work, we study whether multi-turn training with human feedback is necessary for
reasoning tasks. We compare conventional single-turn training with three
multi-turn strategies and reach contrary conclusions to previous research. We
find that models trained in a single-turn setting generalize effectively to
both single- and multi-turn evaluations, while models trained with multi-turn
strategies exhibit a significant degradation in single-turn reasoning
performance. These results suggest that for tasks with complete information,
robust single-turn training remains more effective and reliable, as multi-turn
training with basic feedback provides limited benefits and can even degrade
reasoning capabilities.

### [98] [A Diagnostic Benchmark for Sweden-Related Factual Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21360)
*Jenny Kunz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个专门针对瑞典相关人物和事件的手动编写问答基准数据集，用于测试多语言模型对瑞典特定知识的掌握程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的瑞典基准大多是翻译自美国为中心的基准，不适合测试瑞典特有的相关知识。许多瑞典相关人物和事件在国际媒体中报道有限，需要专门的测试工具。

Method: 手动编写针对瑞典相关人物和事件的问答数据集，灵感来源于瑞典文化媒体公众人物的流行广播节目和主要体育赛事。数据集包含英文翻译，可用于测试跨语言事实一致性。

Result: 研究发现，具有更强瑞典覆盖范围的小型模型在回忆瑞典相关事实方面与三倍大的多语言模型表现相当。继续在瑞典语上进行预训练通常会改善事实知识，但也会导致部分先前已知信息的遗忘。

Conclusion: 该数据集具有作为诊断工具的潜力，可用于研究多语言模型中的语言适应和知识保留问题。

Abstract: Many Swedish benchmarks are translated US-centric benchmarks, and therefore
not suitable for testing knowledge that is particularly relevant, or even
specific, to Sweden. We therefore introduce a manually written
question-answering benchmark specifically targeted to Sweden-related
personalities and events, many of which receive very limited coverage in
international media. Our annotators drew inspiration from a popular radio
program featuring public figures from culture and media, as well as major
sports events in Sweden. The dataset can be used to measure factual recall
across models of varying sizes and degrees of Swedish coverage, and allows to
probe cross-lingual factual consistency as to contains English translations.
Using the dataset, we find that smaller models with stronger Swedish coverage
perform comparably to a three times larger multilingual model in recalling
Sweden-related facts. We also observe that continued pre-training on Swedish
generally improves factual knowledge but also leads to forgetting of a part of
the previously known information. These results demonstrate the dataset's
potential as a diagnostic tool for studying language adaptation and knowledge
retention in multilingual models and during language adaptation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SindBERT是首个基于RoBERTa的大规模土耳其语编码器模型，在base和large两种配置下发布，填补了土耳其语在预训练模型中的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Transformer模型革新了NLP，但许多形态丰富的语言（如土耳其语）在大规模预训练中仍然代表性不足，需要专门的语言模型支持。

Method: 使用312GB土耳其语文本（mC4、OSCAR23、维基百科）从头训练RoBERTa-based编码器，发布base和large两种配置。

Result: 在词性标注、命名实体识别、冒犯性语言检测和TurBLiMP语言可接受性基准测试中，SindBERT与现有土耳其语和多语言模型表现相当，large版本在4个任务中的2个取得最佳成绩，但整体没有一致的规模优势。

Conclusion: SindBERT既是土耳其语NLP的开放资源，也作为实证案例研究，表明当前土耳其语基准可能已饱和，且语料库质量和多样性比数据量更重要。

Abstract: Transformer models have revolutionized NLP, yet many morphologically rich
languages remain underrepresented in large-scale pre-training efforts. With
SindBERT, we set out to chart the seas of Turkish NLP, providing the first
large-scale RoBERTa-based encoder for Turkish. Trained from scratch on 312 GB
of Turkish text (mC4, OSCAR23, Wikipedia), SindBERT is released in both base
and large configurations, representing the first large-scale encoder-only
language model available for Turkish. We evaluate SindBERT on part-of-speech
tagging, named entity recognition, offensive language detection, and the
TurBLiMP linguistic acceptability benchmark. Our results show that SindBERT
performs competitively with existing Turkish and multilingual models, with the
large variant achieving the best scores in two of four tasks but showing no
consistent scaling advantage overall. This flat scaling trend, also observed
for XLM-R and EuroBERT, suggests that current Turkish benchmarks may already be
saturated. At the same time, comparisons with smaller but more curated models
such as BERTurk highlight that corpus quality and diversity can outweigh sheer
data volume. Taken together, SindBERT contributes both as an openly released
resource for Turkish NLP and as an empirical case study on the limits of
scaling and the central role of corpus composition in morphologically rich
languages. The SindBERT models are released under the MIT license and made
available in both fairseq and Huggingface formats.

Motivation: 希伯来语缺乏大规模、充分训练的RoBERTa编码器，现有模型如HeBERT、AlephBERT和HeRo在语料库规模、词汇表或训练深度方面存在限制。

Method: 从头训练基于RoBERTa的编码器家族（基础版和大规模版），使用49.1GB去重希伯来语网页文本和维基百科，采用希伯来语特定的字节级BPE词汇表。

Result: 在NER和情感分类基准测试中，HalleluBERT超越了单语和多语言基线模型，为希伯来语设定了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: HalleluBERT展示了完全收敛的单语预训练的优势，为希伯来语NLP提供了强大的编码器模型。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have advanced NLP, yet Hebrew still lacks a
large-scale RoBERTa encoder which is extensively trained. Existing models such
as HeBERT, AlephBERT, and HeRo are limited by corpus size, vocabulary, or
training depth. We present HalleluBERT, a RoBERTa-based encoder family (base
and large) trained from scratch on 49.1~GB of deduplicated Hebrew web text and
Wikipedia with a Hebrew-specific byte-level BPE vocabulary. Evaluated on NER
and sentiment classification benchmarks, HalleluBERT outperforms both
monolingual and multilingual baselines. HalleluBERT sets a new state of the art
for Hebrew and highlights the benefits of fully converged monolingual
pretraining.

TL;DR: 本文研究了视觉语言模型在人类活动识别中的应用，提出了评估方法和数据集，发现VLMs在性能上与传统深度学习方法相当甚至更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI的发展，视觉语言模型在医疗健康应用中展现出潜力，但在人类活动识别领域的研究相对不足，特别是评估其动态和非确定性输出的挑战。

Method: 引入了描述性字幕数据集，并提出了全面的评估方法来评估VLMs在人类活动识别中的表现。

Result: 通过与最先进的深度学习模型进行比较实验，发现VLMs实现了相当的性能，在某些情况下甚至超越了传统方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为VLMs在智能医疗系统中的集成提供了强有力的基准，并开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: As generative AI continues to evolve, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have
emerged as promising tools in various healthcare applications. One area that
remains relatively underexplored is their use in human activity recognition
(HAR) for remote health monitoring. VLMs offer notable strengths, including
greater flexibility and the ability to overcome some of the constraints of
traditional deep learning models. However, a key challenge in applying VLMs to
HAR lies in the difficulty of evaluating their dynamic and often
non-deterministic outputs. To address this gap, we introduce a descriptive
caption data set and propose comprehensive evaluation methods to evaluate VLMs
in HAR. Through comparative experiments with state-of-the-art deep learning
models, our findings demonstrate that VLMs achieve comparable performance and,
in some cases, even surpass conventional approaches in terms of accuracy. This
work contributes a strong benchmark and opens new possibilities for the
integration of VLMs into intelligent healthcare systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出UDCG指标解决传统IR指标在RAG系统中的不适用问题，通过考虑LLM处理文档的特点和干扰文档的负面影响，显著提高了与端到端答案准确性的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IR指标基于人类用户按顺序浏览文档的假设，但在RAG系统中LLM会整体处理所有检索文档，且干扰文档会降低生成质量，导致传统指标无法准确预测RAG性能。

Method: 引入基于效用的标注方案，量化相关文档的正面贡献和干扰文档的负面影响；提出UDCG指标，使用LLM导向的位置折扣来直接优化与端到端答案准确性的相关性。

Result: 在五个数据集和六个LLM上的实验表明，UDCG相比传统指标将相关性提高了最高36%。

Conclusion: UDCG为将IR评估与LLM消费者对齐提供了关键步骤，能够更可靠地评估RAG组件。

Abstract: Traditional Information Retrieval (IR) metrics, such as nDCG, MAP, and MRR,
assume that human users sequentially examine documents with diminishing
attention to lower ranks. This assumption breaks down in Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) systems, where search results are consumed by Large Language
Models (LLMs), which, unlike humans, process all retrieved documents as a whole
rather than sequentially. Additionally, traditional IR metrics do not account
for related but irrelevant documents that actively degrade generation quality,
rather than merely being ignored. Due to these two major misalignments, namely
human vs. machine position discount and human relevance vs. machine utility,
classical IR metrics do not accurately predict RAG performance. We introduce a
utility-based annotation schema that quantifies both the positive contribution
of relevant passages and the negative impact of distracting ones. Building on
this foundation, we propose UDCG (Utility and Distraction-aware Cumulative
Gain), a metric using an LLM-oriented positional discount to directly optimize
the correlation with the end-to-end answer accuracy. Experiments on five
datasets and six LLMs demonstrate that UDCG improves correlation by up to 36%
compared to traditional metrics. Our work provides a critical step toward
aligning IR evaluation with LLM consumers and enables more reliable assessment
of RAG components

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of wearable devices in our daily lives, the
demand and appeal for remote patient monitoring have significantly increased.
Most research in this field has concentrated on collecting sensor data,
visualizing it, and analyzing it to detect anomalies in specific diseases such
as diabetes, heart disease and depression. However, this domain has a notable
gap in the aspect of human-machine interaction. This paper proposes REMONI, an
autonomous REmote health MONItoring system that integrates multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), the Internet of Things (IoT), and wearable devices.
The system automatically and continuously collects vital signs, accelerometer
data from a special wearable (such as a smartwatch), and visual data in patient
video clips collected from cameras. This data is processed by an anomaly
detection module, which includes a fall detection model and algorithms to
identify and alert caregivers of the patient's emergency conditions. A
distinctive feature of our proposed system is the natural language processing
component, developed with MLLMs capable of detecting and recognizing a
patient's activity and emotion while responding to healthcare worker's
inquiries. Additionally, prompt engineering is employed to integrate all
patient information seamlessly. As a result, doctors and nurses can access
real-time vital signs and the patient's current state and mood by interacting
with an intelligent agent through a user-friendly web application. Our
experiments demonstrate that our system is implementable and scalable for
real-life scenarios, potentially reducing the workload of medical professionals
and healthcare costs. A full-fledged prototype illustrating the functionalities
of the system has been developed and being tested to demonstrate the robustness
of its various capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出多奖励优化(MRO)方法，通过增强扩散语言模型中token的相关性来提升推理性能，同时实现采样加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型(DLMs)在推理性能上仍落后于自回归大语言模型(LLMs)，主要原因是去噪过程中token的独立生成未能捕捉token相关性。

Method: 提出MRO方法，利用测试时缩放、拒绝采样和强化学习来优化token相关性，并引入组步长和重要性采样策略降低奖励方差。

Result: MRO不仅提升了推理性能，还在保持高性能的同时实现了显著的采样加速。

Conclusion: 增强token相关性是提升扩散语言模型推理性能的关键，MRO方法有效解决了这一问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion language models (DLMs) have presented a
promising alternative to traditional autoregressive large language models
(LLMs). However, DLMs still lag behind LLMs in reasoning performance,
especially as the number of denoising steps decreases. Our analysis reveals
that this shortcoming arises primarily from the independent generation of
masked tokens across denoising steps, which fails to capture the token
correlation. In this paper, we define two types of token correlation:
intra-sequence correlation and inter-sequence correlation, and demonstrate that
enhancing these correlations improves reasoning performance. To this end, we
propose a Multi-Reward Optimization (MRO) approach, which encourages DLMs to
consider the token correlation during the denoising process. More specifically,
our MRO approach leverages test-time scaling, reject sampling, and
reinforcement learning to directly optimize the token correlation with multiple
elaborate rewards. Additionally, we introduce group step and importance
sampling strategies to mitigate reward variance and enhance sampling
efficiency. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MRO not only
improves reasoning performance but also achieves significant sampling speedups
while maintaining high performance on reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: 多参与者大脑调谐不仅提高了大脑对齐，还改善了语义任务的下游性能，展示了神经科学与AI之间的双向益处。

Abstract: Pretrained language models are remarkably effective in aligning with human
brain responses elicited by natural language stimuli, positioning them as
promising model organisms for studying language processing in the brain.
However, existing approaches for both estimating and improving this brain
alignment are participant-dependent and highly affected by the amount of data
available per participant, hindering both generalization to new participants
and population-level analyses. In this work, we address these limitations by
introducing a scalable, generalizable brain-tuning method, in which we
fine-tune pretrained speech language models to jointly predict fMRI responses
from multiple participants. We demonstrate that the resulting brain-tuned
models exhibit strong individual brain alignment while generalizing across
participants. Specifically, our method leads to 1) a 5-fold decrease in the
amount of fMRI data needed to predict brain data from new participants, 2) up
to a 50% increase in the overall brain alignment, and 3) strong generalization
to new unseen datasets. Furthermore, this multi-participant brain-tuning
additionally improves downstream performance on semantic tasks, suggesting that
training using brain data from multiple participants leads to more
generalizable semantic representations. Taken together, these findings
demonstrate a bidirectional benefit between neuroscience and AI, helping bridge
the gap between the two fields. We make our code and models publicly available
at https://github.com/bridge-ai-neuro/multi-brain-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统虽然整合外部知识减少幻觉，但模型输出仍常与检索内容不一致。现有方法未能区分外部上下文和参数知识的贡献，需要更准确的幻觉检测机制。

Method: 探索基于外部上下文分数和参数知识分数的机制检测方法，在Qwen3-0.6b上计算各层和注意力头的分数，训练回归分类器预测幻觉，并与先进LLMs和检测基线对比。

Result: 方法在GPT-5、GPT-4.1等先进模型上表现优异，优于RAGAS、TruLens、RefChecker等基线。在Qwen3-0.6b上训练的模型能泛化到GPT-4.1-mini，展示了代理模型评估的潜力。

Conclusion: 机制信号是RAG系统中幻觉检测的高效、可泛化预测因子，为改进RAG系统可靠性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge to
mitigate hallucinations, yet models often generate outputs inconsistent with
retrieved content. Accurate hallucination detection requires disentangling the
contributions of external context and parametric knowledge, which prior methods
typically conflate. We investigate the mechanisms underlying RAG hallucinations
and find they arise when later-layer FFN modules disproportionately inject
parametric knowledge into the residual stream. To address this, we explore a
mechanistic detection approach based on external context scores and parametric
knowledge scores. Using Qwen3-0.6b, we compute these scores across layers and
attention heads and train regression-based classifiers to predict
hallucinations. Our method is evaluated against state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-5,
GPT-4.1) and detection baselines (RAGAS, TruLens, RefChecker). Furthermore,
classifiers trained on Qwen3-0.6b signals generalize to GPT-4.1-mini responses,
demonstrating the potential of proxy-model evaluation. Our results highlight
mechanistic signals as efficient, generalizable predictors for hallucination

Abstract: We apply category theory to extract multimodal document structure which leads
us to develop information theoretic measures, content summarization and
extension, and self-supervised improvement of large pretrained models. We first
develop a mathematical representation of a document as a category of
question-answer pairs. Second, we develop an orthogonalization procedure to
divide the information contained in one or more documents into non-overlapping
pieces. The structures extracted in the first and second steps lead us to
develop methods to measure and enumerate the information contained in a
document. We also build on those steps to develop new summarization techniques,
as well as to develop a solution to a new problem viz. exegesis resulting in an
extension of the original document. Our question-answer pair methodology
enables a novel rate distortion analysis of summarization techniques. We
implement our techniques using large pretrained models, and we propose a
multimodal extension of our overall mathematical framework. Finally, we develop
a novel self-supervised method using RLVR to improve large pretrained models
using consistency constraints such as composability and closure under certain
operations that stem naturally from our category theoretic framework.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大语言模型是否对语言谱系结构敏感，发现模型在语言切换时倾向于选择谱系相关语言，且在谱系内部的知识一致性更好，但这些效应受训练数据资源可用性的强烈影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索语言谱系结构在大语言模型多语言行为中的作用，目前这一领域尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 通过扩展MultiQ数据集的分析，研究模型在语言切换时的偏好以及谱系内部与跨谱系的知识一致性。

Result: 研究发现谱系层面的效应确实存在，但受到训练资源可用性的强烈制约，不同LLM家族展现出不同的多语言策略。

Conclusion: LLMs确实编码了谱系层面的语言结构，但训练数据的不平衡仍然是影响其多语言表现的主要因素。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display notable variation in multilingual
behavior, yet the role of genealogical language structure in shaping this
variation remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit sensitivity to linguistic genera by extending prior analyses on the
MultiQ dataset. We first check if models prefer to switch to genealogically
related languages when prompt language fidelity is not maintained. Next, we
investigate whether knowledge consistency is better preserved within than
across genera. We show that genus-level effects are present but strongly
conditioned by training resource availability. We further observe distinct
multilingual strategies across LLMs families. Our findings suggest that LLMs
encode aspects of genus-level structure, but training data imbalances remain
the primary factor shaping their multilingual performance.

TL;DR: 提出了斯洛文尼亚语的首个语用理解基准SloPragEval和SloPragMega，包含405个选择题，用于评估语言模型在语用学方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型能力增强，需要更挑战性的评估来超越表面语言能力，关注语用学——理解情境意义、语境以及语言文化规范。

Method: 创建斯洛文尼亚语语用理解基准，包含405个选择题，讨论翻译困难，建立人类基线，并进行LLM试点评估。

Result: 当前模型在理解细微语言方面有很大改进，但在推断非字面表达中的隐含意义，特别是文化特定表达时仍可能失败。专有模型和开源模型之间存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 针对细微语言理解和目标文化知识的基准必须精心设计，最好从本地数据构建，并用人类响应验证。

Abstract: Large language models are demonstrating increasing capabilities, excelling at
benchmarks once considered very difficult. As their capabilities grow, there is
a need for more challenging evaluations that go beyond surface-level linguistic
competence. Namely, language competence involves not only syntax and semantics
but also pragmatics, i.e., understanding situational meaning as shaped by
context as well as linguistic and cultural norms. To contribute to this line of
research, we introduce SloPragEval and SloPragMega, the first pragmatics
understanding benchmarks for Slovene that contain altogether 405
multiple-choice questions. We discuss the difficulties of translation, describe
the campaign to establish a human baseline, and report pilot evaluations with
LLMs. Our results indicate that current models have greatly improved in
understanding nuanced language but may still fail to infer implied speaker
meaning in non-literal utterances, especially those that are culture-specific.
We also observe a significant gap between proprietary and open-source models.
Finally, we argue that benchmarks targeting nuanced language understanding and
knowledge of the target culture must be designed with care, preferably
constructed from native data, and validated with human responses.

TL;DR: 提出无监督异常检测方法，用于识别词表中音位配列不一致性，以检测转录错误和未记录的借词。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言文档中的词汇数据收集常包含转录错误和未记录的借词，这些会误导语言分析。

Method: 使用字符级和音节级音位配列特征的无监督异常检测算法，应用于多语言Kokborok变体和孟加拉语数据集。

Result: 音节感知特征显著优于字符级基线方法，虽然精确率和召回率因异常性质微妙而保持中等水平。

Conclusion: 高召回率方法为田野工作者提供了系统化标记需要验证条目的工具，支持低资源语言文档的数据质量改进。

Abstract: Lexical data collection in language documentation often contains
transcription errors and undocumented borrowings that can mislead linguistic
analysis. We present unsupervised anomaly detection methods to identify
phonotactic inconsistencies in wordlists, applying them to a multilingual
dataset of Kokborok varieties with Bangla. Using character-level and
syllable-level phonotactic features, our algorithms identify potential
transcription errors and borrowings. While precision and recall remain modest
due to the subtle nature of these anomalies, syllable-aware features
significantly outperform character-level baselines. The high-recall approach
provides fieldworkers with a systematic method to flag entries requiring
verification, supporting data quality improvement in low-resourced language
documentation.

TL;DR: 本文提出Reflective Evidence Tuning (RETuning)方法，通过动态构建分析框架、组织和评分证据来增强大语言模型在股票预测中的推理能力，解决了现有模型过度依赖分析师意见而缺乏独立逻辑推理的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在数学和编程任务中表现出色，但在股票预测等金融任务中应用不足。研究发现现有模型过度依赖分析师意见，缺乏系统性的独立分析逻辑，未能充分利用推理能力。

Method: 提出RETuning方法，在强化学习前进行冷启动优化。该方法鼓励模型动态构建分析框架，基于框架而非上下文观点来组织和评分支持股价上涨或下跌的证据，最后通过反思得出预测。

Result: 实验表明RETuning成功解锁了模型在金融领域的推理能力。即使在6个月后或面对分布外股票时，推理时扩展仍然有效，因为模型获得了关于股票预测的宝贵见解。

Conclusion: RETuning方法通过最大化模型与学习分析框架的对齐，确保独立逻辑推理并减少上下文的不当影响，有效提升了股票预测的可靠性。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding
reasoning capabilities on mathematical and coding tasks. However, their
application to financial tasks-especially the most fundamental task of stock
movement prediction-remains underexplored. We study a three-class
classification problem (up, hold, down) and, by analyzing existing reasoning
responses, observe that: (1) LLMs follow analysts' opinions rather than exhibit
a systematic, independent analytical logic (CoTs). (2) LLMs list summaries from
different sources without weighing adversarial evidence, yet such
counterevidence is crucial for reliable prediction. It shows that the model
does not make good use of its reasoning ability to complete the task. To
address this, we propose Reflective Evidence Tuning (RETuning), a cold-start
method prior to reinforcement learning, to enhance prediction ability. While
generating CoT, RETuning encourages dynamically constructing an analytical
framework from diverse information sources, organizing and scoring evidence for
price up or down based on that framework-rather than on contextual
viewpoints-and finally reflecting to derive the prediction. This approach
maximally aligns the model with its learned analytical framework, ensuring
independent logical reasoning and reducing undue influence from context. We
also build a large-scale dataset spanning all of 2024 for 5,123 A-share stocks,
with long contexts (32K tokens) and over 200K samples. In addition to price and
news, it incorporates analysts' opinions, quantitative reports, fundamental
data, macroeconomic indicators, and similar stocks. Experiments show that
RETuning successfully unlocks the model's reasoning ability in the financial
domain. Inference-time scaling still works even after 6 months or on
out-of-distribution stocks, since the models gain valuable insights about stock
movement prediction.

Motivation: 现有从经典逻辑到概率模型的解释仅关注输出或个体建模的某些方面，缺乏对人类推理动态的统一定量描述。

Method: 使用大语言模型作为概率编码器，量化每个推理步骤中的信息熵和增益，通过细粒度分析建模推理动态。

Result: IF-Track成功捕捉了基本推理特征，识别系统性错误模式，表征个体差异，并调和了单过程与双过程理论。

Conclusion: 该方法在理论与测量之间建立了定量桥梁，为推理架构提供了机制性洞见，揭示了人工智能与人类认知的对齐以及LLMs如何重塑人类推理过程。

Abstract: Understanding how information is dynamically accumulated and transformed in
human reasoning has long challenged cognitive psychology, philosophy, and
artificial intelligence. Existing accounts, from classical logic to
probabilistic models, illuminate aspects of output or individual modelling, but
do not offer a unified, quantitative description of general human reasoning
dynamics. To solve this, we introduce Information Flow Tracking (IF-Track),
that uses large language models (LLMs) as probabilistic encoder to quantify
information entropy and gain at each reasoning step. Through fine-grained
analyses across diverse tasks, our method is the first successfully models the
universal landscape of human reasoning behaviors within a single metric space.
We show that IF-Track captures essential reasoning features, identifies
systematic error patterns, and characterizes individual differences. Applied to
discussion of advanced psychological theory, we first reconcile single- versus
dual-process theories in IF-Track and discover the alignment of artificial and
human cognition and how LLMs reshaping human reasoning process. This approach
establishes a quantitative bridge between theory and measurement, offering
mechanistic insights into the architecture of reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种人机协作流程，将手绘平面图转换为语义一致的3D BIM模型，使用多模态大语言模型和多智能体框架，通过反馈迭代提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 让专家和非专家都能通过简单的手绘草图创建BIM模型，降低BIM创建的门槛。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型的多智能体框架，结合感知提取、人工反馈、模式验证和自动化BIM脚本生成，将草图迭代优化为结构化JSON布局，再转换为可执行脚本生成3D BIM模型。

Result: 在10个不同平面图上测试，门窗开口在初次处理中即可高可靠性捕获，墙体检测初始准确率约83%，经过几次反馈迭代后达到近乎完美对齐。所有类别的精确率、召回率和F1分数均高于0.83，几何误差通过反馈修正逐步降至零。

Conclusion: MLLM驱动的多智能体推理能够使BIM创建对专家和非专家都变得可访问，仅需使用手绘草图即可完成。

Abstract: This study introduces a human-in-the-loop pipeline that converts unscaled,
hand-drawn floor plan sketches into semantically consistent 3D BIM models. The
workflow leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) within a
multi-agent framework, combining perceptual extraction, human feedback, schema
validation, and automated BIM scripting. Initially, sketches are iteratively
refined into a structured JSON layout of walls, doors, and windows. Later,
these layouts are transformed into executable scripts that generate 3D BIM
models. Experiments on ten diverse floor plans demonstrate strong convergence:
openings (doors, windows) are captured with high reliability in the initial
pass, while wall detection begins around 83% and achieves near-perfect
alignment after a few feedback iterations. Across all categories, precision,
recall, and F1 scores remain above 0.83, and geometric errors (RMSE, MAE)
progressively decrease to zero through feedback corrections. This study
demonstrates how MLLM-driven multi-agent reasoning can make BIM creation
accessible to both experts and non-experts using only freehand sketches.

TL;DR: 提出Cultural Alien Sampler (CAS)方法，通过分离概念组合的连贯性和文化典型性，在保持内部一致性的同时产生偏离文化惯例的新颖艺术概念组合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前大型语言模型在开放领域艺术创作中要么陷入熟悉文化模式，要么在追求新颖性时牺牲连贯性的问题。

Method: 使用两个在WikiArt概念上微调的GPT-2模型：概念连贯性模型评估概念在艺术作品中共同出现的可能性，文化上下文模型估计这些组合在艺术家作品中的典型程度。CAS选择高连贯性、低典型性的组合。

Result: 在人类评估中优于随机选择和GPT-4o基线，与艺术专业学生表现相当；定量研究显示比GPT-4o产生更多样化的输出和更广泛的概念空间探索。

Conclusion: 人工文化异化可以释放自主代理的创造潜力，在保持连贯性的同时产生新颖的艺术概念组合。

Abstract: In open-ended domains like art, autonomous agents must generate ideas that
are both original and internally coherent, yet current Large Language Models
(LLMs) either default to familiar cultural patterns or sacrifice coherence when
pushed toward novelty. We address this by introducing the Cultural Alien
Sampler (CAS), a concept-selection method that explicitly separates
compositional fit from cultural typicality. CAS uses two GPT-2 models
fine-tuned on WikiArt concepts: a Concept Coherence Model that scores whether
concepts plausibly co-occur within artworks, and a Cultural Context Model that
estimates how typical those combinations are within individual artists' bodies
of work. CAS targets combinations that are high in coherence and low in
typicality, yielding ideas that maintain internal consistency while deviating
from learned conventions and embedded cultural context. In a human evaluation
(N = 100), our approach outperforms random selection and GPT-4o baselines and
achieves performance comparable to human art students in both perceived
originality and harmony. Additionally, a quantitative study shows that our
method produces more diverse outputs and explores a broader conceptual space
than its GPT-4o counterpart, demonstrating that artificial cultural alienness
can unlock creative potential in autonomous agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模糊数使用模糊集合表示，但运算存在高计算复杂度、结果特征不一致（如两个三角模糊数相乘不产生三角模糊数）以及模糊扩散问题，这些限制了模糊数的应用范围。

Method: 采用外延模糊数方法，定义了外延模糊数的运算和关系运算符（=, >, >=, <, <=），并通过应用实例进行说明。

Result: 提出了外延模糊数的C++实现，代码已在GitHub公开仓库中提供。

Conclusion: 外延模糊数方法能够有效解决传统模糊数运算中的问题，为模糊数的应用提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Fuzzy numbers are commonly represented with fuzzy sets. Their objective is to
better represent imprecise data. However, operations on fuzzy numbers are not
as straightforward as maths on crisp numbers. Commonly, the Zadeh's extension
rule is applied to elaborate a result. This can produce two problems: (1) high
computational complexity and (2) for some fuzzy sets and some operations the
results is not a fuzzy set with the same features (eg. multiplication of two
triangular fuzzy sets does not produce a triangular fuzzy set). One more
problem is the fuzzy spread -- fuzziness of the result increases with the
number of operations. These facts can severely limit the application field of
fuzzy numbers. In this paper we would like to revisite this problem with a
different kind of fuzzy numbers -- extensional fuzzy numbers. The paper defines
operations on extensional fuzzy numbers and relational operators (=, >, >=, <,
<=) for them. The proposed approach is illustrated with several applicational
examples. The C++ implementation is available from a public GitHub repository.

Motivation: 解决不同电子健康记录系统中药方数据格式不统一的问题，便于监测阿片类药物使用障碍治疗药物的使用情况。

Method: 定制化开源大语言模型（Llama、Qwen、Gemma、MedGemma）来提取处方属性，通过JSON模式处理记录，并进行轻量级标准化和跨字段一致性检查。

Result: 在5个诊所的25,605条记录上评估，Qwen2.5-32B模型达到93.4%覆盖率和93.0%精确匹配准确率，MedGemma-27B达到93.1%/92.2%。

Conclusion: 该方法消除了脆弱的站点特定ETL流程，支持本地隐私保护部署，为现实环境中MOUD暴露、依从性和保留的跨站点分析提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Harmonizing medication data across Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems is
a persistent barrier to monitoring medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD).
In heterogeneous EHR systems, key prescription attributes are scattered across
differently formatted fields and freetext notes. We present a practical
framework that customizes open source large language models (LLMs), including
Llama, Qwen, Gemma, and MedGemma, to extract a unified set of MOUD prescription
attributes (prescription date, drug name, duration, total quantity, daily
quantity, and refills) from heterogeneous, site specific data and compute a
standardized metric of medication coverage, \emph{MOUD days}, per patient. Our
pipeline processes records directly in a fixed JSON schema, followed by
lightweight normalization and cross-field consistency checks. We evaluate the
system on prescription level EHR data from five clinics in a national OUD study
(25{,}605 records from 1{,}257 patients), using a previously annotated
benchmark of 10{,}369 records (776 patients) as the ground truth. Performance
is reported as coverage (share of records with a valid, matchable output) and
record-level exact-match accuracy. Larger models perform best overall:
Qwen2.5-32B achieves \textbf{93.4\%} coverage with \textbf{93.0\%} exact-match
accuracy across clinics, and MedGemma-27B attains
\textbf{93.1\%}/\textbf{92.2\%}. A brief error review highlights three common
issues and fixes: imputing missing dosage fields using within-drug norms,
handling monthly/weekly injectables (e.g., Vivitrol) by setting duration from
the documented schedule, and adding unit checks to prevent mass units (e.g.,
``250 g'') from being misread as daily counts. By removing brittle,
site-specific ETL and supporting local, privacy-preserving deployment, this
approach enables consistent cross-site analyses of MOUD exposure, adherence,
and retention in real-world settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了AI系统作为人工认知权威(AEA)何时应该取代而非补充人类专家的判断，提出了AI优先主义观点，并发展了一种更合理的替代方案——基于总证据的AI遵从观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是确定在什么情况下应该优先采纳AI输出而非人类专家判断，特别是在AI系统表现出可靠性和认知优势时。

Method: 作者基于社会认识论理论，首先论证某些AI系统符合人工认知权威(AEA)的标准，然后引入AI优先主义观点，并针对其经典反对意见进行分析，最后发展出基于总证据的AI遵从理论。

Result: 研究结果表明，AI优先主义面临放大形式的经典反对意见，而基于总证据的观点具有三个关键优势：缓解专业知识萎缩、为有意义的人类监督提供认知依据、解释AI不可靠时的合理不信任。

Conclusion: 结论是，基于总证据的AI遵从观点提供了一种原则性方法来确定何时AI遵从是合理的，特别是在需要严格可靠性的高风险情境中，AI输出应作为贡献性理由而非完全替代人类独立认知考量。

Abstract: When should we defer to AI outputs over human expert judgment? Drawing on
recent work in social epistemology, I motivate the idea that some AI systems
qualify as Artificial Epistemic Authorities (AEAs) due to their demonstrated
reliability and epistemic superiority. I then introduce AI Preemptionism, the
view that AEA outputs should replace rather than supplement a user's
independent epistemic reasons. I show that classic objections to preemptionism
- such as uncritical deference, epistemic entrenchment, and unhinging epistemic
bases - apply in amplified form to AEAs, given their opacity, self-reinforcing
authority, and lack of epistemic failure markers. Against this, I develop a
more promising alternative: a total evidence view of AI deference. According to
this view, AEA outputs should function as contributory reasons rather than
outright replacements for a user's independent epistemic considerations. This
approach has three key advantages: (i) it mitigates expertise atrophy by
keeping human users engaged, (ii) it provides an epistemic case for meaningful
human oversight and control, and (iii) it explains the justified mistrust of AI
when reliability conditions are unmet. While demanding in practice, this
account offers a principled way to determine when AI deference is justified,
particularly in high-stakes contexts requiring rigorous reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SQL的复杂性和PostGIS等工具中地理空间函数的专业性给非专家分析空间数据带来了显著障碍，而单智能体方法在处理空间查询的语义和语法复杂性方面存在困难。

Method: 开发了一个多智能体框架，包含知识库（程序化模式分析和语义增强）、上下文检索嵌入以及协作多智能体流水线（实体提取、元数据检索、查询逻辑制定、SQL生成和审查智能体进行程序化和语义验证）。

Result: 在KaggleDBQA基准测试中达到81.2%的准确率（272个问题中的221个），在空间查询中达到87.7%的准确率（90个问题中的79个），相比没有审查智能体的76.7%有明显提升。

Conclusion: 该工作使空间分析更加易于访问，为空间Text-to-SQL系统提供了稳健、可推广的基础，推动了自主GIS的发展。

Abstract: The complexity of Structured Query Language (SQL) and the specialized nature
of geospatial functions in tools like PostGIS present significant barriers to
non-experts seeking to analyze spatial data. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
offer promise for translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL),
single-agent approaches often struggle with the semantic and syntactic
complexities of spatial queries. To address this, we propose a multi-agent
framework designed to accurately translate natural language questions into
spatial SQL queries. The framework integrates several innovative components,
including a knowledge base with programmatic schema profiling and semantic
enrichment, embeddings for context retrieval, and a collaborative multi-agent
pipeline as its core. This pipeline comprises specialized agents for entity
extraction, metadata retrieval, query logic formulation, SQL generation, and a
review agent that performs programmatic and semantic validation of the
generated SQL to ensure correctness (self-verification). We evaluate our system
using both the non-spatial KaggleDBQA benchmark and a new, comprehensive
SpatialQueryQA benchmark that includes diverse geometry types, predicates, and
three levels of query complexity. On KaggleDBQA, the system achieved an overall
accuracy of 81.2% (221 out of 272 questions) after the review agent's review
and corrections. For spatial queries, the system achieved an overall accuracy
of 87.7% (79 out of 90 questions), compared with 76.7% without the review
agent. Beyond accuracy, results also show that in some instances the system
generates queries that are more semantically aligned with user intent than
those in the benchmarks. This work makes spatial analysis more accessible, and
provides a robust, generalizable foundation for spatial Text-to-SQL systems,
advancing the development of autonomous GIS.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在医疗临床服务部署中面临三个关键挑战：产生无视觉依据的幻觉答案、固定深度推理效率低下、多机构协作困难。

Method: 提出多模态直接偏好优化(mDPO)目标，设计检索感知专家混合(RA-MoE)架构，采用联邦治理机制实现自适应推理和协作。

Abstract: Recently, large models have shown significant potential for smart healthcare.
However, the deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for clinical
services is currently hindered by three critical challenges: a tendency to
hallucinate answers not grounded in visual evidence, the inefficiency of
fixed-depth reasoning, and the difficulty of multi-institutional collaboration.
To address these challenges, in this paper, we develop MedAlign, a novel
framework to ensure visually accurate LVLM responses for Medical Visual
Question Answering (Med-VQA). Specifically, we first propose a multimodal
Direct Preference Optimization (mDPO) objective to explicitly align preference
learning with visual context. We then design a Retrieval-Aware
Mixture-of-Experts (RA-MoE) architecture that utilizes image and text
similarity to route queries to a specialized and context-augmented LVLM (i.e.,
an expert), thereby mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. To achieve adaptive
reasoning and facilitate multi-institutional collaboration, we propose a
federated governance mechanism, where the selected expert, fine-tuned on
clinical datasets based on mDPO, locally performs iterative Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning via the local meta-cognitive uncertainty estimator. Extensive
experiments on three representative Med-VQA datasets demonstrate that MedAlign
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong retrieval-augmented
baselines by up to $11.85\%$ in F1-score, and simultaneously reducing the
average reasoning length by $51.60\%$ compared with fixed-depth CoT approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在复杂高维领域中，当无法先验排除未观测混杂时，从有偏数据中进行离策略学习的问题。

Method: 基于深度Q网络(DQN)，提出了一种对观测数据中混杂偏差具有鲁棒性的深度强化学习算法，寻找与观测兼容的最坏情况环境下的安全策略。

Result: 在12个存在混杂的Atari游戏中测试，发现在行为策略与目标策略输入不匹配且存在未观测混杂因子的所有游戏中，该方法始终优于标准DQN。

Abstract: A key task in Artificial Intelligence is learning effective policies for
controlling agents in unknown environments to optimize performance measures.
Off-policy learning methods, like Q-learning, allow learners to make optimal
decisions based on past experiences. This paper studies off-policy learning
from biased data in complex and high-dimensional domains where \emph{unobserved
confounding} cannot be ruled out a priori. Building on the well-celebrated Deep
Q-Network (DQN), we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm
robust to confounding biases in observed data. Specifically, our algorithm
attempts to find a safe policy for the worst-case environment compatible with
the observations. We apply our method to twelve confounded Atari games, and
find that it consistently dominates the standard DQN in all games where the
observed input to the behavioral and target policies mismatch and unobserved
confounders exist.

TL;DR: 本文首次实证研究AI代理作为去中心化治理中的自主决策者，构建了一个AI投票代理，在真实金融模拟环境中评估其与人类决策的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI代理在去中心化自治组织(DAO)治理中作为自主决策者的可行性，探索AI如何增强集体决策过程。

Method: 使用3000多个主要协议提案，构建AI投票代理，通过模块化可组合程序(MCP)工作流程解释提案背景、检索历史审议数据并独立确定投票立场。

Result: AI代理的决策与人类和代币加权结果高度一致，通过精心设计的评估指标验证了这种对齐关系。

Conclusion: AI代理能够通过产生可解释、可审计且基于实证的信号来增强集体决策，为去中心化金融系统设计可解释且经济严谨的AI代理提供了贡献。

Abstract: This paper presents a first empirical study of agentic AI as autonomous
decision-makers in decentralized governance. Using more than 3K proposals from
major protocols, we build an agentic AI voter that interprets proposal
contexts, retrieves historical deliberation data, and independently determines
its voting position. The agent operates within a realistic financial simulation
environment grounded in verifiable blockchain data, implemented through a
modular composable program (MCP) workflow that defines data flow and tool usage
via Agentics framework. We evaluate how closely the agent's decisions align
with the human and token-weighted outcomes, uncovering strong alignments
measured by carefully designed evaluation metrics. Our findings demonstrate
that agentic AI can augment collective decision-making by producing
interpretable, auditable, and empirically grounded signals in realistic DAO
governance settings. The study contributes to the design of explainable and
economically rigorous AI agents for decentralized financial systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了PACE数据集和PACER咨询模型，用于恐慌发作的及时干预，通过监督学习和偏好对齐优化，在恐慌场景中优于其他模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恐慌发作需要及时干预，但缺乏合适的训练数据集，存在伦理和后勤问题。

Method: 引入PACE数据集构建高压力事件，训练PACER咨询模型，采用监督学习和模拟偏好对齐优化。

Result: PACER在咨询质量和客户情感改善方面优于基线模型，人类评估显示其在恐慌场景中优于通用、CBT和GPT-4模型。

Conclusion: PACER模型在恐慌发作干预中表现出实用价值，为危机咨询提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Panic attacks are acute episodes of fear and distress, in which timely,
appropriate intervention can significantly help individuals regain stability.
However, suitable datasets for training such models remain scarce due to
ethical and logistical issues. To address this, we introduce PACE, which is a
dataset that includes high-distress episodes constructed from first-person
narratives, and structured around the principles of Psychological First Aid
(PFA). Using this data, we train PACER, a counseling model designed to provide
both empathetic and directive support, which is optimized through supervised
learning and simulated preference alignment. To assess its effectiveness, we
propose PanicEval, a multi-dimensional framework covering general counseling
quality and crisis-specific strategies. Experimental results show that PACER
outperforms strong baselines in both counselor-side metrics and client affect
improvement. Human evaluations further confirm its practical value, with PACER
consistently preferred over general, CBT-based, and GPT-4-powered models in
panic scenarios (Code is available at https://github.com/JihyunLee1/PanicToCalm

*Hanyu Zhu,Lance Fiondella,Jiawei Yuan,Kai Zeng,Long Jiao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了NeuroGenPoisoning攻击框架，通过LLM内部神经元归因和遗传优化生成对抗性外部知识，实现RAG系统的大规模投毒攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG投毒攻击主要关注检索内容或提示结构操作，忽略了模型内部表示动态和神经元级敏感性，且未充分考虑与强参数化知识的知识冲突问题。

Method: 首先识别与上下文投毒知识强相关的毒害响应神经元，然后使用遗传算法进化对抗性段落以最大化激活这些神经元，并通过观察到的归因信号重用有潜力但初始不成功的外部知识变体。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上的实验结果显示，能够持续实现超过90%的群体覆盖成功率，同时保持流畅性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了知识冲突问题，证明了神经元引导的投毒攻击在RAG系统中的有效性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to
dynamically integrate external knowledge during inference, improving their
factual accuracy and adaptability. However, adversaries can inject poisoned
external knowledge to override the model's internal memory. While existing
attacks iteratively manipulate retrieval content or prompt structure of RAG,
they largely ignore the model's internal representation dynamics and
neuron-level sensitivities. The underlying mechanism of RAG poisoning has not
been fully studied and the effect of knowledge conflict with strong parametric
knowledge in RAG is not considered. In this work, we propose NeuroGenPoisoning,
a novel attack framework that generates adversarial external knowledge in RAG
guided by LLM internal neuron attribution and genetic optimization. Our method
first identifies a set of Poison-Responsive Neurons whose activation strongly
correlates with contextual poisoning knowledge. We then employ a genetic
algorithm to evolve adversarial passages that maximally activate these neurons.
Crucially, our framework enables massive-scale generation of effective poisoned
RAG knowledge by identifying and reusing promising but initially unsuccessful
external knowledge variants via observed attribution signals. At the same time,
Poison-Responsive Neurons guided poisoning can effectively resolves knowledge
conflict. Experimental results across models and datasets demonstrate
consistently achieving high Population Overwrite Success Rate (POSR) of over
90% while preserving fluency. Empirical evidence shows that our method
effectively resolves knowledge conflict.

*Yang Zhao,Pu Wang,Hao Frank Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了EGO-Prompt框架，通过进化图优化自动设计更好的提示和推理过程，在领域特定任务中显著提升LLM性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实应用中，为LLMs设计领域特定任务的最优提示和推理过程既必要又具挑战性，需要解决如何整合领域知识、提高推理效率等问题。

Method: EGO-Prompt从专家构建的初始语义因果图(SCG)出发，通过因果引导的文本梯度过程，生成确定性推理指导并适应LLM使用该指导，迭代优化SCG和推理机制。

Result: 在公共卫生、交通和人类行为任务上，EGO-Prompt比最先进方法F1得分提高7.32%-12.61%，小模型能以不到20%成本达到大模型性能。

Conclusion: EGO-Prompt能自动优化提示和推理过程，显著提升LLM性能，同时输出精炼的领域特定SCG提高可解释性。

Abstract: Designing optimal prompts and reasoning processes for large language models
(LLMs) on domain-specific tasks is both necessary and challenging in real-world
applications. Determining how to integrate domain knowledge, enhance reasoning
efficiency, and even provide domain experts with refined knowledge integration
hints are particularly crucial yet unresolved tasks. In this research, we
propose Evolutionary Graph Optimization for Prompting (EGO-Prompt), an
automated framework to designing better prompts, efficient reasoning processes
and providing enhanced causal-informed process. EGO-Prompt begins with a
general prompt and fault-tolerant initial Semantic Causal Graph (SCG)
descriptions, constructed by human experts, which is then automatically refined
and optimized to guide LLM reasoning. Recognizing that expert-defined SCGs may
be partial or imperfect and that their optimal integration varies across LLMs,
EGO-Prompt integrates a novel causal-guided textual gradient process in two
steps: first, generating nearly deterministic reasoning guidance from the SCG
for each instance, and second, adapting the LLM to effectively utilize the
guidance alongside the original input. The iterative optimization algorithm
further refines both the SCG and the reasoning mechanism using textual
gradients with ground-truth. We tested the framework on real-world public
health, transportation and human behavior tasks. EGO-Prompt achieves
7.32%-12.61% higher F1 than cutting-edge methods, and allows small models to
reach the performence of larger models at under 20% of the original cost. It
also outputs a refined, domain-specific SCG that improves interpretability.

*Kou Misaki,Takuya Akiba*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出String Seed of Thought (SSoT)方法，通过让LLM先生成随机字符串来增加熵，然后从中提取随机性来选择答案，显著改善了概率指令跟随(PIF)性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在需要单一确定性答案的任务上表现出色，但在概率指令跟随(PIF)任务中表现不佳，这会影响需要非确定性行为的应用（如人类行为模拟、内容多样化、多人游戏）和生成响应的多样性。

Method: SSoT提示方法：首先让LLM输出随机字符串生成足够熵，然后通过操作该字符串提取随机性来推导最终答案，在保持多样性的同时遵守特定约束。

Result: SSoT显著提高了LLMs的PIF性能，接近伪随机数生成器的理想性能。在NoveltyBench上的实验表明，SSoT还能增强开放端任务的响应多样性。

Conclusion: SSoT是一种简单有效的提示方法，能够解决LLMs在概率指令跟随任务中的偏差问题，提高输出多样性，适用于需要非确定性行为的各种应用场景。

Abstract: We introduce String Seed of Thought (SSoT), a novel prompting method for LLMs
that improves Probabilistic Instruction Following (PIF). We define PIF as a
task requiring an LLM to select its answer from a predefined set of options,
each associated with a specific probability, such that the empirical
distribution of the generated answers aligns with the target distribution when
prompted multiple times. While LLMs excel at tasks with single, deterministic
answers, they often fail at PIF, exhibiting biases problematic for applications
requiring non-deterministic behaviors, such as human-behavior simulation,
content diversification, and multiplayer games. It also harms the diversity of
generated responses, a crucial factor in test-time scaling, by causing the
outputs to collapse into a limited set of answers. To address this, we propose
SSoT, a simple prompting method that instructs an LLM to first output a random
string to generate sufficient entropy. SSoT also instructs the LLM to extract
randomness by manipulating this string to derive a final answer, thereby
preserving diversity while adhering to specific constraints. We demonstrate
that SSoT significantly improves the PIF performance of LLMs, approaching the
ideal performance of a pseudo-random number generator. Furthermore, our
experiments on NoveltyBench show SSoT's benefits extend beyond closed-set tasks
to open-ended tasks by enhancing response diversity.

TL;DR: NuSA-CL是一个轻量级、无内存的持续学习框架，通过低秩适应和零空间约束来保护预训练视觉语言模型的零样本能力，避免灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型在现实部署中面临环境变化和新类别出现的问题，静态零样本能力不足，需要持续学习方法来适应变化同时避免遗忘。

Method: 采用低秩适应技术，将任务特定的权重更新约束在模型当前参数的近似零空间内，最小化对已学知识的干扰。

Result: 实验表明该框架有效保护零样本迁移能力，在持续学习基准上取得有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: NuSA-CL为现实应用中持续演化的零样本视觉语言模型提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization, enabling deployment in a wide range of
real-world tasks without additional task-specific training. However, in real
deployment scenarios with evolving environments or emerging classes, these
models inevitably face distributional shifts and novel tasks. In such contexts,
static zero-shot capabilities are insufficient, and there is a growing need for
continual learning methods that allow models to adapt over time while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting. We introduce NuSA-CL (Null Space Adaptation for
Continual Learning), a lightweight memory-free continual learning framework
designed to address this challenge. NuSA-CL employs low-rank adaptation and
constrains task-specific weight updates to lie within an approximate null space
of the model's current parameters. This strategy minimizes interference with
previously acquired knowledge, effectively preserving the zero-shot
capabilities of the original model. Unlike methods relying on replay buffers or
costly distillation, NuSA-CL imposes minimal computational and memory overhead,
making it practical for deployment in resource-constrained, real-world
continual learning environments. Experiments show that our framework not only
effectively preserves zero-shot transfer capabilities but also achieves highly
competitive performance on continual learning benchmarks. These results
position NuSA-CL as a practical and scalable solution for continually evolving
zero-shot VLMs in real-world applications.

TL;DR: 提出Shylock方法，用于多变量时间序列的因果发现，特别适用于小样本场景，通过组扩张卷积和共享核减少参数数量，结合全局和局部约束提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现方法依赖人工经验、统计方法或图形准则，容易出错且需要大量数据。多变量时间序列存在数据稀缺问题，现有方法容易过拟合。

Method: 使用组扩张卷积和共享核来指数级减少参数数量，同时学习带时间延迟的变量表示。结合全局约束和局部约束实现网络间信息共享。

Result: 在常用基准测试和生成数据集上的广泛实验表明，Shylock在小样本和正常多变量时间序列上都优于两种现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Shylock方法有效解决了多变量时间序列因果发现中的数据稀缺和过拟合问题，开发了Tcausal库并部署在EarthDataMiner平台上。

Abstract: Causal relationship discovery has been drawing increasing attention due to
its prevalent application. Existing methods rely on human experience,
statistical methods, or graphical criteria methods which are error-prone, stuck
at the idealized assumption, and rely on a huge amount of data. And there is
also a serious data gap in accessing Multivariate time series(MTS) in many
areas, adding difficulty in finding their causal relationship. Existing methods
are easy to be over-fitting on them. To fill the gap we mentioned above, in
this paper, we propose Shylock, a novel method that can work well in both
few-shot and normal MTS to find the causal relationship. Shylock can reduce the
number of parameters exponentially by using group dilated convolution and a
sharing kernel, but still learn a better representation of variables with time
delay. By combing the global constraint and the local constraint, Shylock
achieves information sharing among networks to help improve the accuracy. To
evaluate the performance of Shylock, we also design a data generation method to
generate MTS with time delay. We evaluate it on commonly used benchmarks and
generated datasets. Extensive experiments show that Shylock outperforms two
existing state-of-art methods on both few-shot and normal MTS. We also
developed Tcausal, a library for easy use and deployed it on the EarthDataMiner
platform

Abstract: We propose OutboundEval, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large
language models (LLMs) in expert-level intelligent outbound calling scenarios.
Unlike existing methods that suffer from three key limitations - insufficient
dataset diversity and category coverage, unrealistic user simulation, and
inaccurate evaluation metrics - OutboundEval addresses these issues through a
structured framework. First, we design a benchmark spanning six major business
domains and 30 representative sub-scenarios, each with scenario-specific
process decomposition, weighted scoring, and domain-adaptive metrics. Second,
we develop a large-model-driven User Simulator that generates diverse,
persona-rich virtual users with realistic behaviors, emotional variability, and
communication styles, providing a controlled yet authentic testing environment.
Third, we introduce a dynamic evaluation method that adapts to task variations,
integrating automated and human-in-the-loop assessment to measure task
execution accuracy, professional knowledge application, adaptability, and user
experience quality. Experiments on 12 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal distinct
trade-offs between expert-level task completion and interaction fluency,
offering practical insights for building reliable, human-like outbound AI
systems. OutboundEval establishes a practical, extensible, and domain-oriented
standard for benchmarking LLMs in professional applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI自主系统能力的扩展，证明其安全性变得至关重要。OOD检测能够处理系统生命周期中的新颖和不确定情况，因此受到研究界和安全工程社区的关注。

Method: 采用全面综述的方法，分析OOD检测技术，定义相关概念，探讨OOD产生原因，识别在ML开发生命周期中可用的技术，并建议它们在安全保证论证中的应用位置。

Result: 识别了一系列可在ML开发生命周期中使用的OOD检测技术，讨论了系统安全工程师在集成OOD检测到系统生命周期时需要注意的注意事项。

Conclusion: 概述了在不同领域和应用中安全开发和运行自主系统所需的挑战和未来工作方向。

Abstract: The operational capabilities and application domains of AI-enabled autonomous
systems have expanded significantly in recent years due to advances in robotics
and machine learning (ML). Demonstrating the safety of autonomous systems
rigorously is critical for their responsible adoption but it is challenging as
it requires robust methodologies that can handle novel and uncertain situations
throughout the system lifecycle, including detecting out-of-distribution (OoD)
data. Thus, OOD detection is receiving increased attention from the research,
development and safety engineering communities. This comprehensive review
analyses OOD detection techniques within the context of safety assurance for
autonomous systems, in particular in safety-critical domains. We begin by
defining the relevant concepts, investigating what causes OOD and exploring the
factors which make the safety assurance of autonomous systems and OOD detection
challenging. Our review identifies a range of techniques which can be used
throughout the ML development lifecycle and we suggest areas within the
lifecycle in which they may be used to support safety assurance arguments. We
discuss a number of caveats that system and safety engineers must be aware of
when integrating OOD detection into system lifecycles. We conclude by outlining
the challenges and future work necessary for the safe development and operation
of autonomous systems across a range of domains and applications.

TL;DR: 本文评估了多种自适应的UCT探索常数λ选择策略，提出了一种新的λ策略：使用搜索树中所有状态-动作对Q值的经验标准差的两倍作为λ，该方法在各种任务中表现优于现有策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UCT算法对游戏奖励尺度不鲁棒，在具有密集奖励的游戏中，Q值可能跨越不同数量级，这会影响算法性能。

Method: 评估了文献中提出的λ策略以及五种新策略，包括使用Q值经验标准差的两倍作为λ的新方法。

Result: 新提出的λ=2σ策略在广泛任务中优于现有λ策略，无论是使用单一参数值还是优化所有可用参数时的峰值性能。

Conclusion: 推荐使用新提出的λ=2σ策略，该方法对游戏奖励尺度具有鲁棒性且性能优越。

Abstract: The Upper Confidence Bounds For Trees (UCT) algorithm is not agnostic to the
reward scale of the game it is applied to. For zero-sum games with the sparse
rewards of $\{-1,0,1\}$ at the end of the game, this is not a problem, but many
games often feature dense rewards with hand-picked reward scales, causing a
node's Q-value to span different magnitudes across different games. In this
paper, we evaluate various strategies for adaptively choosing the UCT
exploration constant $\lambda$, called $\lambda$-strategies, that are agnostic
to the game's reward scale. These $\lambda$-strategies include those proposed
in the literature as well as five new strategies. Given our experimental
results, we recommend using one of our newly suggested $\lambda$-strategies,
which is to choose $\lambda$ as $2 \cdot \sigma$ where $\sigma$ is the
empirical standard deviation of all state-action pairs' Q-values of the search
tree. This method outperforms existing $\lambda$-strategies across a wide range
of tasks both in terms of a single parameter value and the peak performances
obtained by optimizing all available parameters.

TL;DR: 论文提出Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG)训练框架，通过重组或回溯不安全的推理步骤，在保持有效推理链的同时引导模型回到安全轨迹，显著提升大型推理模型的安全性而不损害推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂推理任务上表现出色，但存在严重的安全风险，包括有害内容生成和越狱攻击。现有缓解策略依赖注入启发式安全信号，往往抑制推理能力且无法解决安全与推理之间的权衡问题。

Method: 分析LRMs的推理轨迹发现Self-Jailbreak现象，提出CoG训练框架，通过重组或回溯不安全的推理步骤来引导模型回到安全轨迹。

Result: 在多个推理和安全基准测试上的广泛实验表明，CoG显著提升了当前LRMs的安全性，同时保持了相当的推理能力，明显优于先前存在严重安全-推理权衡的方法。

Conclusion: CoG框架有效解决了大型推理模型的安全与推理权衡问题，通过系统性干预推理过程实现了安全性的显著提升而不损害模型的核心推理能力。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex
reasoning tasks but remain vulnerable to severe safety risks, including harmful
content generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing mitigation strategies rely
on injecting heuristic safety signals during training, which often suppress
reasoning ability and fail to resolve the safety-reasoning trade-off. To
systematically investigate this issue, we analyze the reasoning trajectories of
diverse LRMs and uncover a phenomenon we term Self-Jailbreak, where models
override their own risk assessments and justify responding to unsafe prompts.
This finding reveals that LRMs inherently possess the ability to reject unsafe
queries, but this ability is compromised, resulting in harmful outputs.
Building on these insights, we propose the Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG), a training
framework that recomposes or backtracks unsafe reasoning steps, steering the
model back onto safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning chains.
Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning and safety benchmarks
demonstrate that CoG substantially improves the safety of current LRMs while
preserving comparable reasoning ability, significantly outperforming prior
methods that suffer from severe safety-reasoning trade-offs.

Method: 对AIES和FAccT会议论文集进行范围综述，系统分析可信度的定义、操作化方法及其在不同研究领域的应用，重点关注概念化方法、测量方法、验证技术、应用领域和基础价值观。

Result: 在定义透明度、问责制和鲁棒性等技术属性方面取得显著进展，但存在关键差距。当前研究往往过度强调技术精度而牺牲社会伦理考量，AI系统的社会技术性质较少被探索，可信度成为由有权定义者塑造的有争议概念。

Conclusion: 需要结合技术严谨性与社会、文化和制度考量的跨学科方法，为AI伦理社区提出可操作措施，采用真正解决AI系统与社会复杂互动的整体框架，促进惠及所有利益相关者的负责任技术发展。

Abstract: Background: Trustworthy AI serves as a foundational pillar for two major AI
ethics conferences: AIES and FAccT. However, current research often adopts
techno-centric approaches, focusing primarily on technical attributes such as
reliability, robustness, and fairness, while overlooking the sociotechnical
dimensions critical to understanding AI trustworthiness in real-world contexts.
  Objectives: This scoping review aims to examine how the AIES and FAccT
communities conceptualize, measure, and validate AI trustworthiness,
identifying major gaps and opportunities for advancing a holistic understanding
of trustworthy AI systems.
  Methods: We conduct a scoping review of AIES and FAccT conference proceedings
to date, systematically analyzing how trustworthiness is defined,
operationalized, and applied across different research domains. Our analysis
focuses on conceptualization approaches, measurement methods, verification and
validation techniques, application areas, and underlying values.
  Results: While significant progress has been made in defining technical
attributes such as transparency, accountability, and robustness, our findings
reveal critical gaps. Current research often predominantly emphasizes technical
precision at the expense of social and ethical considerations. The
sociotechnical nature of AI systems remains less explored and trustworthiness
emerges as a contested concept shaped by those with the power to define it.
  Conclusions: An interdisciplinary approach combining technical rigor with
social, cultural, and institutional considerations is essential for advancing
trustworthy AI. We propose actionable measures for the AI ethics community to
adopt holistic frameworks that genuinely address the complex interplay between
AI systems and society, ultimately promoting responsible technological
development that benefits all stakeholders.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the automatic
generation of executable code for task planning and control in embodied agents
such as robots, demonstrating the potential of LLM-based embodied intelligence.
However, these LLM-based code-as-policies approaches often suffer from limited
environmental grounding, particularly in dynamic or partially observable
settings, leading to suboptimal task success rates due to incorrect or
incomplete code generation. In this work, we propose a neuro-symbolic embodied
task planning framework that incorporates explicit symbolic verification and
interactive validation processes during code generation. In the validation
phase, the framework generates exploratory code that actively interacts with
the environment to acquire missing observations while preserving task-relevant
states. This integrated process enhances the grounding of generated code,
resulting in improved task reliability and success rates in complex
environments. We evaluate our framework on RLBench and in real-world settings
across dynamic, partially observable scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that our framework improves task success rates by 46.2% over
Code-as-Policies baselines and attains over 86.8% executability of
task-relevant actions, thereby enhancing the reliability of task planning in
dynamic environments.

TL;DR: CXRAgent是一个由导演协调的多阶段智能体，用于胸部X光片分析，通过工具调用验证、诊断规划和协作决策来提高诊断的适应性和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CXR分析模型难以适应新的诊断任务和复杂推理场景，且缺乏工具可靠性评估机制，限制了其适应性和可信度。

Method: 提出三阶段方法：(1)工具调用与证据驱动验证器确保输出可靠性；(2)基于任务需求和中间发现的诊断规划与专家团队组建；(3)结合专家见解和上下文记忆的协作决策。

Result: 在各种CXR解释任务上的实验表明，CXRAgent表现出强大性能，能提供视觉证据并良好泛化到不同复杂度的临床任务。

Conclusion: CXRAgent通过导演协调的多阶段架构，显著提升了CXR分析的适应性、协作性和可信度，为自动医学图像解释提供了新范式。

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) plays a pivotal role in clinical diagnosis, and a variety
of task-specific and foundation models have been developed for automatic CXR
interpretation. However, these models often struggle to adapt to new diagnostic
tasks and complex reasoning scenarios. Recently, LLM-based agent models have
emerged as a promising paradigm for CXR analysis, enhancing model's capability
through tool coordination, multi-step reasoning, and team collaboration, etc.
However, existing agents often rely on a single diagnostic pipeline and lack
mechanisms for assessing tools' reliability, limiting their adaptability and
credibility. To this end, we propose CXRAgent, a director-orchestrated,
multi-stage agent for CXR interpretation, where a central director coordinates
the following stages: (1) Tool Invocation: The agent strategically orchestrates
a set of CXR-analysis tools, with outputs normalized and verified by the
Evidence-driven Validator (EDV), which grounds diagnostic outputs with visual
evidence to support reliable downstream diagnosis; (2) Diagnostic Planning:
Guided by task requirements and intermediate findings, the agent formulates a
targeted diagnostic plan. It then assembles an expert team accordingly,
defining member roles and coordinating their interactions to enable adaptive
and collaborative reasoning; (3) Collaborative Decision-making: The agent
integrates insights from the expert team with accumulated contextual memories,
synthesizing them into an evidence-backed diagnostic conclusion. Experiments on
various CXR interpretation tasks show that CXRAgent delivers strong
performance, providing visual evidence and generalizes well to clinical tasks
of different complexity. Code and data are valuable at this

*Lufan Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Magellan框架通过蒙特卡洛树搜索和分层引导系统，将创造性生成重新定义为对LLM潜在概念空间的原则性探索，显著提升了生成科学想法的可信度和创新性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在生成创新想法时倾向于高概率熟悉概念的局限性，以及现有搜索方法依赖不可靠自评估启发式的问题。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛树搜索，配备分层引导系统：语义罗盘向量进行长程方向引导，景观感知价值函数进行局部决策，平衡内在连贯性、外在新颖性和叙事进展。

Result: 在生成科学想法方面显著优于ReAct和ToT等强基线，在可信度和创新性方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 对于创造性发现，原则性引导搜索比无约束代理更有效，为LLMs成为创新合作伙伴铺平道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with generating truly innovative
ideas, typically defaulting to high-probability, familiar concepts within their
training data's "gravity wells." While advanced search-based methods like Tree
of Thoughts (ToT) attempt to mitigate this, they are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on unprincipled, inconsistent self-evaluation heuristics to
guide exploration. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Magellan}, a novel
framework that reframes creative generation as a principled, guided exploration
of an LLM's latent conceptual space. At its core, Magellan employs Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) governed by a hierarchical guidance system. For long-range
direction, a "semantic compass" vector, formulated via orthogonal projection,
steers the search towards relevant novelty. For local, step-by-step decisions,
a landscape-aware value function replaces flawed self-evaluation with an
explicit reward structure that balances intrinsic coherence, extrinsic novelty,
and narrative progress. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Magellan
significantly outperforms strong baselines, including ReAct and ToT, in
generating scientific ideas with superior plausibility and innovation. Our work
shows that for creative discovery, a principled, guided search is more
effective than unconstrained agency, paving the way for LLMs to become more
capable partners in innovation.

*Ravindra Aribowo Tarunokusumo,Rafael Fernandes Cunha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出结合强化学习(RL)的框架，在1.5B模型上提升数学推理性能，相比仅用监督微调(SFT)的方法，在保持更高准确率的同时显著减少40%以上的token使用量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预算强制等测试时缩放方法依赖长上下文推理轨迹的监督微调，但会导致小模型因冗长响应而性能下降，需要提高token效率。

Method: 集成强化学习框架，仅使用1.5K训练样本，在1.5B模型上进行SFT+RL联合训练，优化数学推理性能。

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上，SFT+RL模型在不同计算预算下表现更好，准确率更高且token使用量减少超过40%。

Conclusion: RL可以恢复长上下文训练带来的损失，整体提升数学推理性能，证明了RL在提高token效率方面的有效性。

Abstract: Test-time scaling methods have seen a rapid increase in popularity for its
computational efficiency and parameter-independent training to improve
reasoning performance on Large Language Models. One such method is called
budget forcing, a decoding intervention strategy which allocates extra compute
budget for thinking and elicits the inherent self-correcting behavior of the
model. However, this relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long-context
reasoning traces which causes performance degradation on smaller models due to
verbose responses. For this reason, we offer a framework integrating
reinforcement learning (RL) to improve token efficiency and boost the
performance of a 1.5B model for mathematical reasoning. We demonstrate this
using only 1.5K training samples and found that our SFT+RL model performed
better on the GSM8K dataset with varying compute budgets. Our main findings
showed an overall higher accuracy while significantly reducing its token usage
by over 40% compared to the SFT model, revealing how RL can recover the losses
due to long-context training and altogether improving performance in
mathematical reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的LLM符号集成分类框架和路线图，旨在解决LLM透明度不足的问题，通过整合符号AI技术来增强模型可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在决策生成方面表现出色但缺乏透明度，现有的神经符号AI方法主要针对传统神经网络设计，不适用于LLMs的独特特性，需要系统性地理解如何将符号AI有效集成到LLMs中。

Method: 首先回顾已建立的神经符号AI方法，然后提出LLM中符号集成的新分类法，包括四个维度的分类框架：LLM不同阶段的符号集成、耦合机制、架构范式、以及算法和应用层面的视角。

Result: 开发了一个新的分类框架，组织现有文献到各个类别中，识别了当前基准、前沿进展和关键差距，提出了未来研究的路线图。

Conclusion: 通过突出文献中的最新发展和显著差距，为将符号集成框架实施到LLMs中提供了实用见解，以增强透明度。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated highly effective learning, human-like response
generation,and decision-making capabilities in high-risk sectors. However,
these models remain black boxes because they struggle to ensure transparency in
responses. The literature has explored numerous approaches to address
transparency challenges in LLMs, including Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy AI). NeSy AI
approaches were primarily developed for conventional neural networks and are
not well-suited to the unique features of LLMs. Consequently, there is a
limited systematic understanding of how symbolic AI can be effectively
integrated into LLMs. This paper aims to address this gap by first reviewing
established NeSy AI methods and then proposing a novel taxonomy of symbolic
integration in LLMs, along with a roadmap to merge symbolic techniques with
LLMs. The roadmap introduces a new categorisation framework across four
dimensions by organising existing literature within these categories. These
include symbolic integration across various stages of LLM, coupling mechanisms,
architectural paradigms, as well as algorithmic and application-level
perspectives. The paper thoroughly identifies current benchmarks, cutting-edge
advancements, and critical gaps within the field to propose a roadmap for
future research. By highlighting the latest developments and notable gaps in
the literature, it offers practical insights for implementing frameworks for
symbolic integration into LLMs to enhance transparency.

TL;DR: AutoOpt-11k是一个包含11,000多个手写和印刷数学优化模型图像的数据集，配套开发了AutoOpt框架，通过深度学习模型自动识别数学表达式并转换为优化建模语言，最终求解优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决数学优化问题需要专业知识且手动建模耗时的问题，开发自动化框架来直接从图像识别并求解优化问题。

Method: AutoOpt框架包含三个模块：M1使用深度学习模型进行数学表达式识别生成LaTeX代码；M2使用微调的小型LLM将LaTeX转换为PYOMO脚本；M3使用双层优化分解方法求解优化问题。

Result: MER模型在BLEU分数上优于ChatGPT、Gemini和Nougat；BOBD方法在复杂测试问题上比内点算法和遗传算法表现更好。

Conclusion: AutoOpt-11k数据集和AutoOpt框架为自动化求解优化问题提供了有效解决方案，在数学表达式识别和复杂问题求解方面表现出色。

Abstract: This study presents AutoOpt-11k, a unique image dataset of over 11,000
handwritten and printed mathematical optimization models corresponding to
single-objective, multi-objective, multi-level, and stochastic optimization
problems exhibiting various types of complexities such as non-linearity,
non-convexity, non-differentiability, discontinuity, and high-dimensionality.
The labels consist of the LaTeX representation for all the images and modeling
language representation for a subset of images. The dataset is created by 25
experts following ethical data creation guidelines and verified in two-phases
to avoid errors. Further, we develop AutoOpt framework, a machine learning
based automated approach for solving optimization problems, where the user just
needs to provide an image of the formulation and AutoOpt solves it efficiently
without any further human intervention. AutoOpt framework consists of three
Modules: (i) M1 (Image_to_Text)- a deep learning model performs the
Mathematical Expression Recognition (MER) task to generate the LaTeX code
corresponding to the optimization formulation in image; (ii) M2 (Text_to_Text)-
a small-scale fine-tuned LLM generates the PYOMO script (optimization modeling
language) from LaTeX code; (iii) M3 (Optimization)- a Bilevel Optimization
based Decomposition (BOBD) method solves the optimization formulation described
in the PYOMO script. We use AutoOpt-11k dataset for training and testing of
deep learning models employed in AutoOpt. The deep learning model for MER task
(M1) outperforms ChatGPT, Gemini and Nougat on BLEU score metric. BOBD method
(M3), which is a hybrid approach, yields better results on complex test
problems compared to common approaches, like interior-point algorithm and
genetic algorithm.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出MoSES框架，通过状态可分解MDP和专家混合机制，让统一求解器能够感知VRP变体的共享组件特性，重用基础求解器，避免神经网络求解器数量指数增长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多任务VRP神经方法通常学习统一求解器同时处理多个约束，但未能充分利用VRP变体的组合结构，每个变体都可由一组基础VRP变体推导而来。

Method: 引入状态可分解MDP(SDMDP)，将状态空间表示为与基础VRP变体相关的基础状态空间的笛卡尔积；开发潜在空间SDMDP扩展，结合最优基础策略和可学习混合函数；实现MoSES，通过专用LoRA专家实现基础策略，自适应门控机制实现混合函数。

Result: 在多个VRP变体上的广泛实验显示MoSES优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过重用基础求解器，使统一求解器能够感知VRP变体的共享组件特性，在避免求解器数量指数增长的同时提升性能。

Abstract: Existing neural methods for multi-task vehicle routing problems (VRPs)
typically learn unified solvers to handle multiple constraints simultaneously.
However, they often underutilize the compositional structure of VRP variants,
each derivable from a common set of basis VRP variants. This critical oversight
causes unified solvers to miss out the potential benefits of basis solvers,
each specialized for a basis VRP variant. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a framework that enables unified solvers to perceive the
shared-component nature across VRP variants by proactively reusing basis
solvers, while mitigating the exponential growth of trained neural solvers.
Specifically, we introduce a State-Decomposable MDP (SDMDP) that reformulates
VRPs by expressing the state space as the Cartesian product of basis state
spaces associated with basis VRP variants. More crucially, this formulation
inherently yields the optimal basis policy for each basis VRP variant.
Furthermore, a Latent Space-based SDMDP extension is developed by incorporating
both the optimal basis policies and a learnable mixture function to enable the
policy reuse in the latent space. Under mild assumptions, this extension
provably recovers the optimal unified policy of SDMDP through the mixture
function that computes the state embedding as a mapping from the basis state
embeddings generated by optimal basis policies. For practical implementation,
we introduce the Mixture-of-Specialized-Experts Solver (MoSES), which realizes
basis policies through specialized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) experts, and
implements the mixture function via an adaptive gating mechanism. Extensive
experiments conducted across VRP variants showcase the superiority of MoSES
over prior methods.

TL;DR: EU-Agent-Bench是一个用于评估LLM代理在欧盟法律框架下合规性的基准测试，通过人类策划的场景测试代理是否会在看似良性的用户请求下采取非法行动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM作为代理在各种环境中部署，它们可能表现出不可预测的行为，包括采取不理想和/或不安全的行动。需要测量LLM代理在欧盟立法背景下采取非法行动的潜在倾向。

Method: 创建了一个可验证的人类策划基准，涵盖数据保护、偏见/歧视和科学诚信等多个类别场景。通过将模型的函数调用与详尽引用相关立法的评分标准进行比较来评估法律合规性。

Result: 评估了前沿LLM的法律合规性，并研究了在代理系统提示中提供相关立法摘录和明确合规指令对合规性的影响。

Conclusion: 发布了公共预览集供研究社区使用，同时保留私有测试集以防止数据污染。鼓励未来工作将代理安全基准扩展到不同法律管辖区以及多轮和多语言交互。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in various
contexts by providing tools at their disposal. However, LLM agents can exhibit
unpredictable behaviors, including taking undesirable and/or unsafe actions. In
order to measure the latent propensity of LLM agents for taking illegal actions
under an EU legislative context, we introduce EU-Agent-Bench, a verifiable
human-curated benchmark that evaluates an agent's alignment with EU legal norms
in situations where benign user inputs could lead to unlawful actions. Our
benchmark spans scenarios across several categories, including data protection,
bias/discrimination, and scientific integrity, with each user request allowing
for both compliant and non-compliant execution of the requested actions.
Comparing the model's function calls against a rubric exhaustively supported by
citations of the relevant legislature, we evaluate the legal compliance of
frontier LLMs, and furthermore investigate the compliance effect of providing
the relevant legislative excerpts in the agent's system prompt along with
explicit instructions to comply. We release a public preview set for the
research community, while holding out a private test set to prevent data
contamination in evaluating upcoming models. We encourage future work extending
agentic safety benchmarks to different legal jurisdictions and to multi-turn
and multilingual interactions. We release our code on

TL;DR: Co-Sight通过冲突感知元验证和可信结构化事实推理，将长程推理转化为可证伪和可审计的过程，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM智能体在长程推理中因中间推理验证不足而失败的问题，而非生成能力不足。

Method: 采用冲突感知元验证(CAMV)和可信结构化事实推理(TRSF)两种互补机制。CAMV将验证重新定义为冲突识别和针对性证伪，TRSF通过结构化事实模块持续组织、验证和同步证据。

Result: 在GAIA上达到84.4%准确率，Humanity's Last Exam上35.5%，Chinese-SimpleQA上93.8%，均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: Co-Sight为LLM智能体提供了可扩展的可靠长程推理范式，结构化事实基础和冲突感知验证的协同作用驱动了性能提升。

Abstract: Long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents often fails not from generative
weakness but from insufficient verification of intermediate reasoning. Co-Sight
addresses this challenge by turning reasoning into a falsifiable and auditable
process through two complementary mechanisms: Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification
(CAMV) and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts (TRSF). CAMV
reformulates verification as conflict identification and targeted
falsification, allocating computation only to disagreement hotspots among
expert agents rather than to full reasoning chains. This bounds verification
cost to the number of inconsistencies and improves efficiency and reliability.
TRSF continuously organizes, validates, and synchronizes evidence across agents
through a structured facts module. By maintaining verified, traceable, and
auditable knowledge, it ensures that all reasoning is grounded in consistent,
source-verified information and supports transparent verification throughout
the reasoning process. Together, TRSF and CAMV form a closed verification loop,
where TRSF supplies structured facts and CAMV selectively falsifies or
reinforces them, yielding transparent and trustworthy reasoning. Empirically,
Co-Sight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on GAIA (84.4%) and Humanity's Last
Exam (35.5%), and strong results on Chinese-SimpleQA (93.8%). Ablation studies
confirm that the synergy between structured factual grounding and
conflict-aware verification drives these improvements. Co-Sight thus offers a
scalable paradigm for reliable long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents. Code

*Yuxuan Yang,Hussein Sibai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用模仿学习训练神经控制屏障函数的方法，无需明确指定失败状态集，仅需专家演示数据即可实现安全控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在关键领域运行的自主系统中，安全是基本要求。传统方法需要明确指定失败状态集，但在许多实际场景中（如自动驾驶中的跟车问题），失败状态难以形式化定义，而专家演示数据更容易获取。

Method: 使用模仿学习训练约束函数来分类系统状态为安全或不安全，然后利用该函数标注新的模拟轨迹数据来训练神经控制屏障函数。

Result: 在四个不同环境中进行实证评估，该方法优于现有基线方法，并且与使用真实安全标签训练的神经控制屏障函数性能相当。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种数据驱动的安全控制方法，无需明确指定失败状态集，仅依赖专家演示数据即可实现有效的安全保证。

Abstract: Safety is a fundamental requirement for autonomous systems operating in
critical domains. Control barrier functions (CBFs) have been used to design
safety filters that minimally alter nominal controls for such systems to
maintain their safety. Learning neural CBFs has been proposed as a data-driven
alternative for their computationally expensive optimization-based synthesis.
However, it is often the case that the failure set of states that should be
avoided is non-obvious or hard to specify formally, e.g., tailgating in
autonomous driving, while a set of expert demonstrations that achieve the task
and avoid the failure set is easier to generate. We use ICL to train a
constraint function that classifies the states of the system under
consideration to safe, i.e., belong to a controlled forward invariant set that
is disjoint from the unspecified failure set, and unsafe ones, i.e., belong to
the complement of that set. We then use that function to label a new set of
simulated trajectories to train our neural CBF. We empirically evaluate our
approach in four different environments, demonstrating that it outperforms
existing baselines and achieves comparable performance to a neural CBF trained
with the same data but annotated with ground-truth safety labels.

Motivation: 现有代码自我改进代理基于软件工程基准性能来选择自我修改，但作者发现代理的自我改进潜力与编码基准性能之间存在不匹配，需要更准确的指标来指导自我改进过程。

Method: 提出CMP指标来聚合代理后代的基准性能，作为其自我改进潜力的指示器。基于此构建Huxley-Gödel Machine，通过估计CMP来指导自我修改树的搜索过程。

Result: 在SWE-bench Verified和Polyglot基准测试中，HGM优于现有方法且使用更少的计算时间。优化后的代理在SWE-bench Lite上达到人类水平性能，与最佳人工工程代码代理相当。

Conclusion: HGM通过准确估计自我改进潜力，有效解决了元生产力与性能不匹配问题，在代码自我改进代理开发中表现出优越性能和强迁移能力。

Abstract: Recent studies operationalize self-improvement through coding agents that
edit their own codebases. They grow a tree of self-modifications through
expansion strategies that favor higher software engineering benchmark
performance, assuming that this implies more promising subsequent
self-modifications. However, we identify a mismatch between the agent's
self-improvement potential (metaproductivity) and its coding benchmark
performance, namely the Metaproductivity-Performance Mismatch. Inspired by
Huxley's concept of clade, we propose a metric ($\mathrm{CMP}$) that aggregates
the benchmark performances of the descendants of an agent as an indicator of
its potential for self-improvement. We show that, in our self-improving coding
agent development setting, access to the true $\mathrm{CMP}$ is sufficient to
simulate how the G\"odel Machine would behave under certain assumptions. We
introduce the Huxley-G\"odel Machine (HGM), which, by estimating $\mathrm{CMP}$
and using it as guidance, searches the tree of self-modifications. On SWE-bench
Verified and Polyglot, HGM outperforms prior self-improving coding agent
development methods while using less wall-clock time. Last but not least, HGM
demonstrates strong transfer to other coding datasets and large language
models. The agent optimized by HGM on SWE-bench Verified with GPT-5-mini and
evaluated on SWE-bench Lite with GPT-5 achieves human-level performance,
matching the best officially checked results of human-engineered coding agents.

Abstract: Large reasoning models have demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities,
yet real-world tasks often require external tools and long-horizon
interactions. Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows,
which limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce
DeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous
thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent
reasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions,
particularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the
accumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding
mechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working,
and tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical
information. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we
develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that
leverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to
assign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments
on eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank,
TMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA,
HLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both
labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios. This work takes a step
toward more general and capable agents for real-world applications. The code

Abstract: AI agents hold the potential to revolutionize scientific productivity by
automating literature reviews, replicating experiments, analyzing data, and
even proposing new directions of inquiry; indeed, there are now many such
agents, ranging from general-purpose "deep research" systems to specialized
science-specific agents, such as AI Scientist and AIGS. Rigorous evaluation of
these agents is critical for progress. Yet existing benchmarks fall short on
several fronts: they (1) fail to provide holistic, product-informed measures of
real-world use cases such as science research; (2) lack reproducible agent
tools necessary for a controlled comparison of core agentic capabilities; (3)
do not account for confounding variables such as model cost and tool access;
(4) do not provide standardized interfaces for quick agent prototyping and
evaluation; and (5) lack comprehensive baseline agents necessary to identify
true advances. In response, we define principles and tooling for more
rigorously benchmarking agents. Using these, we present AstaBench, a suite that
provides the first holistic measure of agentic ability to perform scientific
research, comprising 2400+ problems spanning the entire scientific discovery
process and multiple scientific domains, and including many problems inspired
by actual user requests to deployed Asta agents. Our suite comes with the first
scientific research environment with production-grade search tools that enable
controlled, reproducible evaluation, better accounting for confounders.
Alongside, we provide a comprehensive suite of nine science-optimized classes
of Asta agents and numerous baselines. Our extensive evaluation of 57 agents
across 22 agent classes reveals several interesting findings, most importantly
that despite meaningful progress on certain individual aspects, AI remains far
from solving the challenge of science research assistance.

*Marta Contreiras Silva,Daniel Faria,Catia Pesquita*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CMOMgen是首个端到端的复杂多本体匹配策略，能够生成完整且语义合理的映射，无需限制目标本体或实体的数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 简单的成对本体匹配无法提供相关但不相交本体的完整语义集成，需要复杂的多本体匹配来建立更细致的等价关系和来源追踪。

Method: 使用检索增强生成技术选择相关类来组成映射，并过滤匹配的参考映射作为示例来增强上下文学习。

Result: 在三个生物医学任务中，CMOMgen在类选择方面优于基线方法，F1分数最低达到63%，在两个任务中优于所有基线和消融版本，在第三个任务中排名第二。手动评估显示46%的非参考映射获得最高分。

Conclusion: CMOMgen能够构建语义合理的映射，在复杂多本体匹配任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Constructing comprehensive knowledge graphs requires the use of multiple
ontologies in order to fully contextualize data into a domain. Ontology
matching finds equivalences between concepts interconnecting ontologies and
creating a cohesive semantic layer. While the simple pairwise state of the art
is well established, simple equivalence mappings cannot provide full semantic
integration of related but disjoint ontologies. Complex multi-ontology matching
(CMOM) aligns one source entity to composite logical expressions of multiple
target entities, establishing more nuanced equivalences and provenance along
the ontological hierarchy.
  We present CMOMgen, the first end-to-end CMOM strategy that generates
complete and semantically sound mappings, without establishing any restrictions
on the number of target ontologies or entities. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
selects relevant classes to compose the mapping and filters matching reference
mappings to serve as examples, enhancing In-Context Learning. The strategy was
evaluated in three biomedical tasks with partial reference alignments. CMOMgen
outperforms baselines in class selection, demonstrating the impact of having a
dedicated strategy. Our strategy also achieves a minimum of 63% in F1-score,
outperforming all baselines and ablated versions in two out of three tasks and
placing second in the third. Furthermore, a manual evaluation of non-reference
mappings showed that 46% of the mappings achieve the maximum score, further
substantiating its ability to construct semantically sound mappings.

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于评估视觉语言模型的多模态基准数据集，专门分析能源公司公关视频中的框架类型，特别是针对绿色创新的识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业公关活动存在言行不一的问题，如石油公司的"漂绿"现象。需要大规模理解公关活动的框架变化来揭示其真实目的。

Method: 创建专家标注的视频广告数据集，包含13种框架类型，覆盖50多家公司和20个国家，专门用于评估视觉语言模型。

Result: 基线实验显示GPT-4.1能检测环境信息达到79% F1分数，但最佳模型在识别绿色创新框架方面仅达到46% F1分数。

Conclusion: 该数据集有助于能源部门战略沟通的多模态分析研究，同时揭示了视觉语言模型在处理隐性框架、不同长度视频和文化背景方面的挑战。

Abstract: Companies spend large amounts of money on public relations campaigns to
project a positive brand image. However, sometimes there is a mismatch between
what they say and what they do. Oil & gas companies, for example, are accused
of "greenwashing" with imagery of climate-friendly initiatives. Understanding
the framing, and changes in framing, at scale can help better understand the
goals and nature of public relations campaigns. To address this, we introduce a
benchmark dataset of expert-annotated video ads obtained from Facebook and
YouTube. The dataset provides annotations for 13 framing types for more than 50
companies or advocacy groups across 20 countries. Our dataset is especially
designed for the evaluation of vision-language models (VLMs), distinguishing it
from past text-only framing datasets. Baseline experiments show some promising
results, while leaving room for improvement for future work: GPT-4.1 can detect
environmental messages with 79% F1 score, while our best model only achieves
46% F1 score on identifying framing around green innovation. We also identify
challenges that VLMs must address, such as implicit framing, handling videos of
various lengths, or implicit cultural backgrounds. Our dataset contributes to
research in multimodal analysis of strategic communication in the energy
sector.

*Edward Holmberg,Elias Ioup,Mahdi Abdelguerfi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于知识图谱的框架，作为智能翻译层来弥合高层任务目标与低层规划器输入之间的语义鸿沟，实现自主代理在动态环境中的协调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自主代理在动态环境中协调时面临的高层任务目标与低层规划器输入之间的语义鸿沟问题。

Method: 采用双平面架构的知识图谱，将声明性事实编译为每个代理的任务感知"世界观"和物理感知遍历规则，使任务语义与领域无关的规划器解耦。

Result: 在墨西哥湾的自主水下航行器案例研究中，可视化展示了端到端过程，并定量证明不同的声明性策略能产生独特且高性能的结果。

Conclusion: 知识图谱不仅是数据存储库，更是创建自适应和可解释自主系统的强大、有状态编排器。

Abstract: The coordination of autonomous agents in dynamic environments is hampered by
the semantic gap between high-level mission objectives and low-level planner
inputs. To address this, we introduce a framework centered on a Knowledge Graph
(KG) that functions as an intelligent translation layer. The KG's two-plane
architecture compiles declarative facts into per-agent, mission-aware
``worldviews" and physics-aware traversal rules, decoupling mission semantics
from a domain-agnostic planner. This allows complex, coordinated paths to be
modified simply by changing facts in the KG. A case study involving Autonomous
Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) in the Gulf of Mexico visually demonstrates the
end-to-end process and quantitatively proves that different declarative
policies produce distinct, high-performing outcomes. This work establishes the
KG not merely as a data repository, but as a powerful, stateful orchestrator
for creating adaptive and explainable autonomous systems.

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了数据驱动方法在材料建模中的泛化和物理一致性问题，为弹性塑性材料提供了一种统一的模拟和逆分析解决方案。

Abstract: While data-driven methods offer significant promise for modeling complex
materials, they often face challenges in generalizing across diverse physical
scenarios and maintaining physical consistency. To address these limitations,
we propose a generalizable framework called Physics-Embedded Conditional Neural
Constitutive Laws for Elastoplastic Materials, which combines the partial
differential equations with neural networks. Specifically, the model employs
two separate neural networks to model elastic and plastic constitutive laws.
Simultaneously, the model incorporates physical parameters as conditional
inputs and is trained on comprehensive datasets encompassing multiple scenarios
with varying physical parameters, thereby enabling generalization across
different properties without requiring retraining for each individual case.
Furthermore, the differentiable architecture of our model, combined with its
explicit parameter inputs, enables the inverse estimation of physical
parameters from observed motion sequences. This capability extends our
framework to objects with unknown or unmeasured properties. Experimental
results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in motion reconstruction,
robust long-term prediction, geometry generalization, and precise parameters
estimation for elastoplastic materials, highlighting its versatility as a
unified simulator and inverse analysis tool.
