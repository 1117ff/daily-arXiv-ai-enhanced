*Emanuel Garbin,Guy Adam,Oded Krams,Zohar Barzelay,Eran Guendelman,Michael Schwarz,Moran Vatelmacher,Yigal Shenkman,Eli Peker,Itai Druker,Uri Patish,Yoav Blum,Max Bluvstein,Junxuan Li,Rawal Khirodkar,Shunsuke Saito*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种零样本管道，从少量非结构化手机图像创建超逼真、保持身份特征的3D头像，解决了现有方法在几何一致性和高频细节方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在几何不一致、幻觉问题，且合成数据训练的模型无法捕捉皮肤皱纹和细发等高频细节，限制了真实感。

Method: 引入生成式规范化模块处理多视角图像为标准化表示，并使用基于transformer的模型在新的大规模高斯溅射头像数据集上训练。

Result: 该"捕获、规范化、溅射"管道能从非结构化照片生成具有出色真实感和稳健身份保持的静态四分之一身体头像。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持身份特征的同时实现了超逼真的3D头像生成，解决了现有技术的核心挑战。

Abstract: We present a novel, zero-shot pipeline for creating hyperrealistic,
identity-preserving 3D avatars from a few unstructured phone images. Existing
methods face several challenges: single-view approaches suffer from geometric
inconsistencies and hallucinations, degrading identity preservation, while
models trained on synthetic data fail to capture high-frequency details like
skin wrinkles and fine hair, limiting realism. Our method introduces two key
contributions: (1) a generative canonicalization module that processes multiple
unstructured views into a standardized, consistent representation, and (2) a
transformer-based model trained on a new, large-scale dataset of high-fidelity
Gaussian splatting avatars derived from dome captures of real people. This
"Capture, Canonicalize, Splat" pipeline produces static quarter-body avatars
with compelling realism and robust identity preservation from unstructured
photos.

### [2] [GauSSmart: Enhanced 3D Reconstruction through 2D Foundation Models and Geometric Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14270)
*Alexander Valverde,Brian Xu,Yuyin Zhou,Meng Xu,Hongyun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GauSSmart是一种混合方法，有效结合2D基础模型和3D高斯溅射重建，通过2D分割先验和特征嵌入指导高斯溅射的密集化和细化，提升稀疏区域的覆盖率和细节保留。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高斯溅射在大规模数据集上表现良好，但在稀疏覆盖区域难以捕捉精细细节或保持真实感，主要受限于稀疏3D训练数据的固有局限性。

Method: 整合2D计算机视觉技术（凸滤波和DINO等基础模型的语义特征监督），利用2D分割先验和高维特征嵌入指导高斯溅射的密集化和细化。

Result: 在三个数据集上的验证表明，GauSSmart在大多数评估场景中持续优于现有高斯溅射方法。

Conclusion: 混合2D-3D方法具有显著潜力，通过将2D基础模型与3D重建管道有机结合，可以克服各自方法的固有局限性。

Abstract: Scene reconstruction has emerged as a central challenge in computer vision,
with approaches such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting
achieving remarkable progress. While Gaussian Splatting demonstrates strong
performance on large-scale datasets, it often struggles to capture fine details
or maintain realism in regions with sparse coverage, largely due to the
inherent limitations of sparse 3D training data.
  In this work, we propose GauSSmart, a hybrid method that effectively bridges
2D foundational models and 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction. Our approach
integrates established 2D computer vision techniques, including convex
filtering and semantic feature supervision from foundational models such as
DINO, to enhance Gaussian-based scene reconstruction. By leveraging 2D
segmentation priors and high-dimensional feature embeddings, our method guides
the densification and refinement of Gaussian splats, improving coverage in
underrepresented areas and preserving intricate structural details.
  We validate our approach across three datasets, where GauSSmart consistently
outperforms existing Gaussian Splatting in the majority of evaluated scenes.
Our results demonstrate the significant potential of hybrid 2D-3D approaches,
highlighting how the thoughtful combination of 2D foundational models with 3D
reconstruction pipelines can overcome the limitations inherent in either
approach alone.

### [3] [Inpainting the Red Planet: Diffusion Models for the Reconstruction of Martian Environments in Virtual Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14765)
*Giuseppe Lorenzo Catalano,Agata Marta Soccini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于无条件扩散模型的方法来重建火星表面，填补卫星图像中的缺失值，相比传统方法在重建精度和感知相似性方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 火星地形数据中存在大量缺失值，传统插值方法难以保持几何一致性，而地球上的条件方法无法应用于火星，因此需要开发专门的无条件深度学习方法。

Method: 使用无条件扩散模型，在12000张来自NASA HiRISE调查的火星高度图上进行训练，采用非均匀缩放策略捕捉多尺度地形特征，最终调整为128x128分辨率。

Result: 在1000个样本的评估集上，该方法在重建精度（RMSE提升4-15%）和感知相似性（LPIPS提升29-81%）方面均优于逆距离加权、克里金插值和纳维-斯托克斯算法等传统方法。

Conclusion: 基于无条件扩散模型的方法能够有效重建火星表面，填补地形数据中的缺失值，为空间探索中的虚拟现实应用提供更可靠的地形表示。

Abstract: Space exploration increasingly relies on Virtual Reality for several tasks,
such as mission planning, multidisciplinary scientific analysis, and astronaut
training. A key factor for the reliability of the simulations is having
accurate 3D representations of planetary terrains. Extraterrestrial heightmaps
derived from satellite imagery often contain missing values due to acquisition
and transmission constraints. Mars is among the most studied planets beyond
Earth, and its extensive terrain datasets make the Martian surface
reconstruction a valuable task, although many areas remain unmapped. Deep
learning algorithms can support void-filling tasks; however, whereas Earth's
comprehensive datasets enables the use of conditional methods, such approaches
cannot be applied to Mars. Current approaches rely on simpler interpolation
techniques which, however, often fail to preserve geometric coherence. In this
work, we propose a method for reconstructing the surface of Mars based on an
unconditional diffusion model. Training was conducted on an augmented dataset
of 12000 Martian heightmaps derived from NASA's HiRISE survey. A
non-homogeneous rescaling strategy captures terrain features across multiple
scales before resizing to a fixed 128x128 model resolution. We compared our
method against established void-filling and inpainting techniques, including
Inverse Distance Weighting, kriging, and Navier-Stokes algorithm, on an
evaluation set of 1000 samples. Results show that our approach consistently
outperforms these methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy (4-15% on RMSE)
and perceptual similarity (29-81% on LPIPS) with the original data.

### [4] [MultiFoodhat: A potential new paradigm for intelligent food quality inspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13889)
*Yue Hu,Guohang Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiFoodChat是一个基于多智能体对话的零样本食物识别框架，通过整合视觉语言模型和大语言模型实现协作推理，无需额外训练或标注即可识别未见过的食物类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有监督模型对大规模标注数据的依赖问题，以及难以泛化到未见食物类别的局限性，实现更智能的食物质量检测和饮食评估。

Method: 采用多智能体对话框架，包含对象感知令牌(OPT)提取细粒度视觉特征，交互式推理代理(IRA)通过多轮视觉-文本对话动态解释上下文线索来优化预测。

Result: 在多个公共食物数据集上的实验表明，MultiFoodChat在识别准确性和可解释性方面优于现有的无监督和少样本方法。

Conclusion: MultiFoodChat为零样本食物识别提供了新范式，在智能食物质量检测和分析方面具有重要潜力。

Abstract: Food image classification plays a vital role in intelligent food quality
inspection, dietary assessment, and automated monitoring. However, most
existing supervised models rely heavily on large labeled datasets and exhibit
limited generalization to unseen food categories. To overcome these challenges,
this study introduces MultiFoodChat, a dialogue-driven multi-agent reasoning
framework for zero-shot food recognition. The framework integrates
vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) to enable
collaborative reasoning through multi-round visual-textual dialogues. An Object
Perception Token (OPT) captures fine-grained visual attributes, while an
Interactive Reasoning Agent (IRA) dynamically interprets contextual cues to
refine predictions. This multi-agent design allows flexible and human-like
understanding of complex food scenes without additional training or manual
annotations. Experiments on multiple public food datasets demonstrate that
MultiFoodChat achieves superior recognition accuracy and interpretability
compared with existing unsupervised and few-shot methods, highlighting its
potential as a new paradigm for intelligent food quality inspection and
analysis.

### [5] [Ponimator: Unfolding Interactive Pose for Versatile Human-human Interaction Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14976)
*Shaowei Liu,Chuan Guo,Bing Zhou,Jian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ponimator是一个基于近距离交互姿态的动画生成框架，使用两个条件扩散模型从交互姿态生成动态运动序列或合成交互姿态，支持图像动画、反应动画和文本到交互合成等任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近距离人体交互姿态蕴含丰富的交互动态信息，人类能从中推断上下文并预测动态变化。受此启发，作者希望利用交互姿态先验来生成多样化的交互动画。

Method: 使用两个条件扩散模型：(1)姿态动画器利用时间先验从交互姿态生成动态运动序列；(2)姿态生成器利用空间先验从单姿态、文本或两者合成交互姿态。训练数据来自动作捕捉交互数据集中的近距离双人姿态及其时间上下文。

Result: 在多样化数据集和应用上的实验证明了姿态先验的通用性以及框架的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Ponimator框架能够将高质量动作捕捉数据中的交互知识迁移到开放世界场景中，支持多种交互动画任务。

Abstract: Close-proximity human-human interactive poses convey rich contextual
information about interaction dynamics. Given such poses, humans can
intuitively infer the context and anticipate possible past and future dynamics,
drawing on strong priors of human behavior. Inspired by this observation, we
propose Ponimator, a simple framework anchored on proximal interactive poses
for versatile interaction animation. Our training data consists of
close-contact two-person poses and their surrounding temporal context from
motion-capture interaction datasets. Leveraging interactive pose priors,
Ponimator employs two conditional diffusion models: (1) a pose animator that
uses the temporal prior to generate dynamic motion sequences from interactive
poses, and (2) a pose generator that applies the spatial prior to synthesize
interactive poses from a single pose, text, or both when interactive poses are
unavailable. Collectively, Ponimator supports diverse tasks, including
image-based interaction animation, reaction animation, and text-to-interaction
synthesis, facilitating the transfer of interaction knowledge from high-quality
mocap data to open-world scenarios. Empirical experiments across diverse
datasets and applications demonstrate the universality of the pose prior and
the effectiveness and robustness of our framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一个用于分割子宫内膜异位症中常见视觉表现——深色子宫内膜植入物的系统，该系统能够分析腹腔镜手术视频并标注识别区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 子宫内膜异位症具有多种视觉表现且发生在不同体内位置，这使得其识别非常困难，特别是对于非专科医生。该系统旨在为妇科医生提供辅助诊断支持。

Method: 训练了一个能够分割深色子宫内膜植入物的系统，该系统能够处理腹腔镜手术视频，使用多色叠加标注识别区域，并提供检测摘要以改进视频浏览。

Result: 系统成功开发并能够自动识别和标注子宫内膜异位症中的深色植入物区域。

Conclusion: 该系统为妇科医生在诊断子宫内膜异位症时提供了有价值的辅助工具，通过自动视频分析提高了诊断效率和准确性。

Abstract: Endometriosis is a common women's condition exhibiting a manifold visual
appearance in various body-internal locations. Having such properties makes its
identification very difficult and error-prone, at least for laymen and
non-specialized medical practitioners. In an attempt to provide assistance to
gynecologic physicians treating endometriosis, this demo paper describes a
system that is trained to segment one frequently occurring visual appearance of
endometriosis, namely dark endometrial implants. The system is capable of
analyzing laparoscopic surgery videos, annotating identified implant regions
with multi-colored overlays and displaying a detection summary for improved
video browsing.

### [7] [Efficient Few-Shot Learning in Remote Sensing: Fusing Vision and Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13993)
*Jia Yun Chua,Argyrios Zolotas,Miguel Arana-Catania*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究将传统视觉模型与视觉语言模型结合，用于遥感图像分析，在飞机检测和场景理解任务上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉模型需要大量领域特定标注数据且对复杂环境上下文理解有限，而视觉语言模型在遥感领域的应用仍待探索。

Method: 将YOLO与LLaVA、ChatGPT、Gemini等视觉语言模型集成，在标注和未标注遥感数据以及退化图像场景下进行评估。

Result: 在飞机检测和计数任务中平均MAE提升48.46%，在挑战性条件下表现优异；CLIPScore提升6.17%用于遥感图像全面理解。

Conclusion: 传统视觉模型与视觉语言模型的结合为遥感图像分析开辟了新途径，特别是在少样本学习场景中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Remote sensing has become a vital tool across sectors such as urban planning,
environmental monitoring, and disaster response. While the volume of data
generated has increased significantly, traditional vision models are often
constrained by the requirement for extensive domain-specific labelled data and
their limited ability to understand the context within complex environments.
Vision Language Models offer a complementary approach by integrating visual and
textual data; however, their application to remote sensing remains
underexplored, particularly given their generalist nature. This work
investigates the combination of vision models and VLMs to enhance image
analysis in remote sensing, with a focus on aircraft detection and scene
understanding. The integration of YOLO with VLMs such as LLaVA, ChatGPT, and
Gemini aims to achieve more accurate and contextually aware image
interpretation. Performance is evaluated on both labelled and unlabelled remote
sensing data, as well as degraded image scenarios which are crucial for remote
sensing. The findings show an average MAE improvement of 48.46% across models
in the accuracy of aircraft detection and counting, especially in challenging
conditions, in both raw and degraded scenarios. A 6.17% improvement in
CLIPScore for comprehensive understanding of remote sensing images is obtained.
The proposed approach combining traditional vision models and VLMs paves the
way for more advanced and efficient remote sensing image analysis, especially
in few-shot learning scenarios.

TL;DR: 开发并验证了一种基于AI的系统，用于检测前列腺癌中的筛状形态，该系统在内部和外部验证中表现优异，甚至超过了九位专家病理学家的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前列腺癌中的筛状形态是预后不良的组织学特征，但存在报告不足和观察者间变异性的问题，需要提高检测的准确性和一致性。

Method: 使用EfficientNetV2-S编码器和多实例学习的深度学习模型，在640个前列腺穿刺活检切片上进行训练，并在多个内部和外部队列中进行验证。

Result: 模型在内部验证中AUC为0.97，Cohen's kappa为0.81；在外部验证中AUC为0.90，Cohen's kappa为0.55；在评分者间分析中平均Cohen's kappa为0.66，优于所有九位病理学家。

Conclusion: 该AI模型在前列腺癌筛状形态检测方面达到了病理学家水平，有望提高诊断可靠性、标准化报告并改善治疗决策。

Abstract: Background: Cribriform morphology in prostate cancer is a histological
feature that indicates poor prognosis and contraindicates active surveillance.
However, it remains underreported and subject to significant interobserver
variability amongst pathologists. We aimed to develop and validate an AI-based
system to improve cribriform pattern detection.
  Methods: We created a deep learning model using an EfficientNetV2-S encoder
with multiple instance learning for end-to-end whole-slide classification. The
model was trained on 640 digitised prostate core needle biopsies from 430
patients, collected across three cohorts. It was validated internally (261
slides from 171 patients) and externally (266 slides, 104 patients from three
independent cohorts). Internal validation cohorts included laboratories or
scanners from the development set, while external cohorts used completely
independent instruments and laboratories. Annotations were provided by three
expert uropathologists with known high concordance. Additionally, we conducted
an inter-rater analysis and compared the model's performance against nine
expert uropathologists on 88 slides from the internal validation cohort.
  Results: The model showed strong internal validation performance (AUC: 0.97,
95% CI: 0.95-0.99; Cohen's kappa: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72-0.89) and robust external
validation (AUC: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.86-0.93; Cohen's kappa: 0.55, 95% CI:
0.45-0.64). In our inter-rater analysis, the model achieved the highest average
agreement (Cohen's kappa: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.57-0.74), outperforming all nine
pathologists whose Cohen's kappas ranged from 0.35 to 0.62.
  Conclusion: Our AI model demonstrates pathologist-level performance for
cribriform morphology detection in prostate cancer. This approach could enhance
diagnostic reliability, standardise reporting, and improve treatment decisions
for prostate cancer patients.

### [9] [NAPPure: Adversarial Purification for Robust Image Classification under Non-Additive Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14025)
*Junjie Nan,Jianing Li,Wei Chen,Mingkun Zhang,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了NAPPure框架，扩展了对抗净化方法以处理非加性对抗扰动（如模糊、遮挡、扭曲），通过似然最大化分离干净图像和扰动参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗净化方法主要针对加性扰动设计，对非加性扰动效果不佳，而现实世界中非加性扰动很常见。

Method: 建立对抗图像生成过程，通过似然最大化分离干净图像和扰动参数。

Result: 在GTSRB和CIFAR-10数据集上的实验表明，NAPPure显著提升了图像分类模型对非加性扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NAPPure框架成功扩展了对抗净化的适用范围，能有效处理非加性对抗扰动。

Abstract: Adversarial purification has achieved great success in combating adversarial
image perturbations, which are usually assumed to be additive. However,
non-additive adversarial perturbations such as blur, occlusion, and distortion
are also common in the real world. Under such perturbations, existing
adversarial purification methods are much less effective since they are
designed to fit the additive nature. In this paper, we propose an extended
adversarial purification framework named NAPPure, which can further handle
non-additive perturbations. Specifically, we first establish the generation
process of an adversarial image, and then disentangle the underlying clean
image and perturbation parameters through likelihood maximization. Experiments
on GTSRB and CIFAR-10 datasets show that NAPPure significantly boosts the
robustness of image classification models against non-additive perturbations.

### [10] [Vgent: Graph-based Retrieval-Reasoning-Augmented Generation For Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14032)
*Xiaoqian Shen,Wenxuan Zhang,Jun Chen,Mohamed Elhoseiny*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Vgent框架，通过图结构表示视频和中间推理步骤，解决长视频理解中时间依赖断裂和无关信息干扰的问题，显著提升大视频语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解面临处理密集视频token超出上下文窗口和保留长期序列信息的挑战。现有检索增强生成方法在长视频中面临时间依赖断裂和无关信息干扰的问题。

Method: 提出Vgent框架：1) 用结构化图表示视频，保留视频片段间的语义关系；2) 引入中间推理步骤，通过结构化验证减少检索噪声，显式聚合跨片段相关信息。

Result: 在三个长视频理解基准测试中，相比基础模型在MLVU上整体性能提升3.0%~5.4%，优于最先进的视频RAG方法8.6%。

Conclusion: Vgent框架通过图结构表示和中间推理有效解决了长视频理解中的关键挑战，显著提升了大视频语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over long videos pose significant challenges for
large video language models (LVLMs) due to the difficulty in processing
intensive video tokens beyond context window and retaining long-term sequential
information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated
effectiveness in processing long context for Large Language Models (LLMs);
however, applying RAG to long video faces challenges such as disrupted temporal
dependencies and inclusion of irrelevant information that can hinder accurate
reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Vgent, a novel graph-based
retrieval-reasoning-augmented generation framework to enhance LVLMs for long
video understanding. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (i) It
represents videos by structured graphs with semantic relationships across video
clips preserved to improve retrieval effectiveness. (ii) It introduces an
intermediate reasoning step to mitigate the reasoning limitation of LVLMs,
which leverages structured verification to reduce retrieval noise and
facilitate the explicit aggregation of relevant information across clips,
resulting in more accurate and context-aware responses. We comprehensively
evaluate our framework with various open-source LVLMs on three long-video
understanding benchmarks. Our approach yielded an overall performance
improvement of $3.0\%\sim 5.4\%$ over base models on MLVU, and outperformed
state-of-the-art video RAG methods by $8.6\%$. Our code is publicly available
at https://xiaoqian-shen.github.io/Vgent.

*Avihai Naaman,Ron Shapira Weber,Oren Freifeld*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TPL是一种基于原型学习的视频同步框架，通过构建共享的紧凑1D表示来对齐不同场景或生成AI视频，无需穷举成对匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不同场景或生成AI视频之间的复杂同步挑战，这些视频存在多样化主题、背景和非线性时间错位问题。

Method: TPL框架从预训练模型提取的高维嵌入中构建共享的紧凑1D表示，学习统一原型序列来锚定关键动作阶段。

Result: 实验显示TPL在多样化数据集上提高了同步准确性、效率和鲁棒性，特别是在细粒度帧检索和阶段分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: TPL是首个解决多个生成AI视频同步问题的方法，在视频同步领域具有重要创新价值。

Abstract: Synchronizing videos captured simultaneously from multiple cameras in the
same scene is often easy and typically requires only simple time shifts.
However, synchronizing videos from different scenes or, more recently,
generative AI videos, poses a far more complex challenge due to diverse
subjects, backgrounds, and nonlinear temporal misalignment. We propose Temporal
Prototype Learning (TPL), a prototype-based framework that constructs a shared,
compact 1D representation from high-dimensional embeddings extracted by any of
various pretrained models. TPL robustly aligns videos by learning a unified
prototype sequence that anchors key action phases, thereby avoiding exhaustive
pairwise matching. Our experiments show that TPL improves synchronization
accuracy, efficiency, and robustness across diverse datasets, including
fine-grained frame retrieval and phase classification tasks. Importantly, TPL
is the first approach to mitigate synchronization issues in multiple generative
AI videos depicting the same action. Our code and a new multiple video
synchronization dataset are available at https://bgu-cs-vil.github.io/TPL/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: cubic是一个开源的Python库，通过为SciPy和scikit-image API提供GPU加速的替代方案，解决了生物图像分析中的可扩展性和效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代显微镜生成的大型2D和3D数据集使得现有计算方法的可扩展性和效率受限，现有工具缺乏API支持、GPU加速和3D图像处理能力。

Method: cubic基于CuPy和RAPIDS cuCIM，提供设备无关的API，自动将操作分发到GPU或CPU执行，无缝加速图像处理流程。

Result: 通过基准测试和现有去卷积与分割管道的复现，cubic实现了显著的加速效果，同时保持算法保真度。

Conclusion: cubic为可扩展、可重复的生物图像分析建立了坚实基础，能够与Python科学计算生态系统集成，支持交互式探索和自动化高通量分析工作流。

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of multidimensional biological images is useful for
understanding complex cellular phenotypes and accelerating advances in
biomedical research. As modern microscopy generates ever-larger 2D and 3D
datasets, existing computational approaches are increasingly limited by their
scalability, efficiency, and integration with modern scientific computing
workflows. Existing bioimage analysis tools often lack application programmable
interfaces (APIs), do not support graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration,
lack broad 3D image processing capabilities, and/or have poor interoperability
for compute-heavy workflows. Here, we introduce cubic, an open-source Python
library that addresses these challenges by augmenting widely used SciPy and
scikit-image APIs with GPU-accelerated alternatives from CuPy and RAPIDS cuCIM.
cubic's API is device-agnostic and dispatches operations to GPU when data
reside on the device and otherwise executes on CPU, seamlessly accelerating a
broad range of image processing routines. This approach enables GPU
acceleration of existing bioimage analysis workflows, from preprocessing to
segmentation and feature extraction for 2D and 3D data. We evaluate cubic both
by benchmarking individual operations and by reproducing existing deconvolution
and segmentation pipelines, achieving substantial speedups while maintaining
algorithmic fidelity. These advances establish a robust foundation for
scalable, reproducible bioimage analysis that integrates with the broader
Python scientific computing ecosystem, including other GPU-accelerated methods,
enabling both interactive exploration and automated high-throughput analysis
workflows. cubic is openly available at

Conclusion: 该框架显著推进了视频生成在虚拟制作中的集成应用

Abstract: We introduce a framework that enables both multi-view character consistency
and 3D camera control in video diffusion models through a novel customization
data pipeline. We train the character consistency component with recorded
volumetric capture performances re-rendered with diverse camera trajectories
via 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS), lighting variability obtained with a video
relighting model. We fine-tune state-of-the-art open-source video diffusion
models on this data to provide strong multi-view identity preservation, precise
camera control, and lighting adaptability. Our framework also supports core
capabilities for virtual production, including multi-subject generation using
two approaches: joint training and noise blending, the latter enabling
efficient composition of independently customized models at inference time; it
also achieves scene and real-life video customization as well as control over
motion and spatial layout during customization. Extensive experiments show
improved video quality, higher personalization accuracy, and enhanced camera
control and lighting adaptability, advancing the integration of video
generation into virtual production. Our project page is available at:

Abstract: This paper proposes a joint modeling method of the Big Five, which has long
been studied, and HEXACO, which has recently attracted attention in psychology,
for automatically recognizing apparent personality traits from multimodal human
behavior. Most previous studies have used the Big Five for multimodal apparent
personality-trait recognition. However, no study has focused on apparent HEXACO
which can evaluate an Honesty-Humility trait related to displaced aggression
and vengefulness, social-dominance orientation, etc. In addition, the
relationships between the Big Five and HEXACO when modeled by machine learning
have not been clarified. We expect awareness of multimodal human behavior to
improve by considering these relationships. The key advance of our proposed
method is to optimize jointly recognizing the Big Five and HEXACO. Experiments
using a self-introduction video dataset demonstrate that the proposed method
can effectively recognize the Big Five and HEXACO.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图像重建误差的AI生成图像检测方法计算成本高，且无法捕捉原始图像中的固有噪声特征。

Method: 使用位平面图像处理精炼误差提取，设计最大梯度补丁选择来放大噪声信号，并提出了轻量级分类头结构。

Conclusion: 该方法在AI生成图像检测方面表现出色，具有高准确率、强泛化能力和高效率的优势。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of GAN and Diffusion models makes it more difficult to
distinguish AI-generated images from real ones. Recent studies often use
image-based reconstruction errors as an important feature for determining
whether an image is AI-generated. However, these approaches typically incur
high computational costs and also fail to capture intrinsic noisy features
present in the raw images. To solve these problems, we innovatively refine
error extraction by using bit-plane-based image processing, as lower bit planes
indeed represent noise patterns in images. We introduce an effective bit-planes
guided noisy image generation and exploit various image normalization
strategies, including scaling and thresholding. Then, to amplify the noise
signal for easier AI-generated image detection, we design a maximum gradient
patch selection that applies multi-directional gradients to compute the noise
score and selects the region with the highest score. Finally, we propose a
lightweight and effective classification head and explore two different
structures: noise-based classifier and noise-guided classifier. Extensive
experiments on the GenImage benchmark demonstrate the outstanding performance
of our method, which achieves an average accuracy of \textbf{98.9\%}
(\textbf{11.9}\%~$\uparrow$) and shows excellent cross-generator generalization
capability. Particularly, our method achieves an accuracy of over 98.2\% from
GAN to Diffusion and over 99.2\% from Diffusion to GAN. Moreover, it performs
error extraction at the millisecond level, nearly a hundred times faster than
existing methods. The code is at https://github.com/hongsong-wang/LOTA.

Motivation: 传统深度伪造检测方法依赖手动设计的音素-视位对齐阈值、基本帧级一致性检查或单模态检测策略，无法有效识别由GAN、扩散模型和神经渲染等先进生成模型产生的现代深度伪造内容。

Method: 开发了PIA多模态框架，整合音素序列、嘴唇几何数据和先进的面部身份嵌入，通过识别多个互补模态间的不一致性来检测深度伪造。

Result: 该集成方法显著提高了对细微深度伪造篡改的检测能力，能够识别传统检测器经常忽略的微小时间差异。

Conclusion: PIA框架通过多模态分析有效解决了现代深度伪造检测的挑战，代码已开源供研究社区使用。

Abstract: The rise of manipulated media has made deepfakes a particularly insidious
threat, involving various generative manipulations such as lip-sync
modifications, face-swaps, and avatar-driven facial synthesis. Conventional
detection methods, which predominantly depend on manually designed
phoneme-viseme alignment thresholds, fundamental frame-level consistency
checks, or a unimodal detection strategy, inadequately identify modern-day
deepfakes generated by advanced generative models such as GANs, diffusion
models, and neural rendering techniques. These advanced techniques generate
nearly perfect individual frames yet inadvertently create minor temporal
discrepancies frequently overlooked by traditional detectors. We present a
novel multimodal audio-visual framework, Phoneme-Temporal and Identity-Dynamic
Analysis(PIA), incorporating language, dynamic face motion, and facial
identification cues to address these limitations. We utilize phoneme sequences,
lip geometry data, and advanced facial identity embeddings. This integrated
method significantly improves the detection of subtle deepfake alterations by
identifying inconsistencies across multiple complementary modalities. Code is

Motivation: 传统基于帧的OCC系统存在比特率低和处理负载高的问题，而现有的基于事件传感器的OCC系统尚未充分利用EVS的独特特性，需要专门设计的调制方案。

Method: 提出事件间隔调制(EIM)方案，通过调制事件之间的间隔来编码信息；优化EVS参数以适配EIM；实验确定最大调制阶数；基于获得参数进行传输实验。

Result: 成功实现了28kbps@10米和8.4kbps@50米的室内传输，创下了基于事件OCC系统的比特率新纪录。

Conclusion: EIM方案能够充分利用事件传感器的特性，显著提高了基于事件OCC系统的传输性能，为高速可见光通信提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Optical camera communication (OCC) represents a promising visible light
communication technology. Nonetheless, typical OCC systems utilizing
frame-based cameras are encumbered by limitations, including low bit rate and
high processing load. To address these issues, OCC system utilizing an
event-based vision sensor (EVS) as receivers have been proposed. The EVS
enables high-speed, low-latency, and robust communication due to its
asynchronous operation and high dynamic range. In existing event-based OCC
systems, conventional modulation schemes such as on-off keying (OOK) and pulse
position modulation have been applied, however, to the best of our knowledge,
no modulation method has been proposed that fully exploits the unique
characteristics of the EVS. This paper proposes a novel modulation scheme,
called the event interval modulation (EIM) scheme, specifically designed for
event-based OCC. EIM enables improvement in transmission speed by modulating
information using the intervals between events. This paper proposes a
theoretical model of EIM and conducts a proof-of-concept experiment. First, the
parameters of the EVS are tuned and customized to optimize the frequency
response specifically for EIM. Then, the maximum modulation order usable in EIM
is determined experimentally. We conduct transmission experiments based on the
obtained parameters. Finally, we report successful transmission at 28 kbps over
10 meters and 8.4 kbps over 50 meters in an indoor environment. This sets a new
benchmark for bit rate in event-based OCC systems.

Motivation: 解决大规模场景中定位和渲染的计算成本高、单一网络容量有限的问题。

Method: 引入门控网络隐式分类和选择子网络，每次推理只激活单个子网络；提出无辅助损失负载均衡策略提升定位精度。

Result: 在剑桥测试集上仅需10分钟训练即可获得高质量渲染结果，显著降低计算成本同时保持更高精度。

Conclusion: MACE框架为大规模场景应用提供了高效解决方案，在减少成本的同时维持了高精度定位和渲染质量。

Abstract: Efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes
remain a significant challenge due to the computational cost involved. While
Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods perform well in small-scale
localization, they are limited by the capacity of a single network when
extended to large-scale scenes. To address these challenges, we propose the
Mixed Expert-based Accelerated Coordinate Encoding method (MACE), which enables
efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes.
Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of MOE in large model domains, we
introduce a gating network to implicitly classify and select sub-networks,
ensuring that only a single sub-network is activated during each inference.
Furtheremore, we present Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing(ALF-LB) strategy to
enhance the localization accuracy on large-scale scene. Our framework provides
a significant reduction in costs while maintaining higher precision, offering
an efficient solution for large-scale scene applications. Additional
experiments on the Cambridge test set demonstrate that our method achieves
high-quality rendering results with merely 10 minutes of training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像到视频生成模型在人脸身份一致性方面存在困难，特别是当人脸在图像中占比较小且人物表情和动作变化较大时，这个问题尤为突出。

Method: 使用强化学习框架，通过人脸身份评分器直接优化扩散模型，在采样链的最后步骤反向传播奖励信号，并提出新颖的面部评分机制将真实视频中的面部作为特征池。

Result: 在Wan 2.2 I2V模型和内部I2V模型上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: IPRO方法能够有效增强图像到视频生成中的人脸身份保持能力，无需引入额外模块或改变模型架构。

Abstract: Recent advances in image-to-video (I2V) generation have achieved remarkable
progress in synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent videos from static
images. Among all the applications of I2V, human-centric video generation
includes a large portion. However, existing I2V models encounter difficulties
in maintaining identity consistency between the input human image and the
generated video, especially when the person in the video exhibits significant
expression changes and movements. This issue becomes critical when the human
face occupies merely a small fraction of the image. Since humans are highly
sensitive to identity variations, this poses a critical yet under-explored
challenge in I2V generation. In this paper, we propose Identity-Preserving
Reward-guided Optimization (IPRO), a novel video diffusion framework based on
reinforcement learning to enhance identity preservation. Instead of introducing
auxiliary modules or altering model architectures, our approach introduces a
direct and effective tuning algorithm that optimizes diffusion models using a
face identity scorer. To improve performance and accelerate convergence, our
method backpropagates the reward signal through the last steps of the sampling
chain, enabling richer gradient feedback. We also propose a novel facial
scoring mechanism that treats faces in ground-truth videos as facial feature
pools, providing multi-angle facial information to enhance generalization. A
KL-divergence regularization is further incorporated to stabilize training and
prevent overfitting to the reward signal. Extensive experiments on Wan 2.2 I2V
model and our in-house I2V model demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: 现有方法如VACE和Phantom在特定主题视频生成方面有进展，但在多人物动态交互中难以保持身份一致性，这对多角色一致性要求高的场景至关重要。

Method: 构建基于大规模偏好数据集的视频奖励模型，包含人工标注和合成失真数据，采用针对多人物一致性优化的GRPO变体来增强VACE和Phantom。

Result: 实验显示Identity-GRPO在人物一致性指标上比基线方法提升高达18.9%，为强化学习与个性化视频生成的对齐提供了可行见解。

Conclusion: Identity-GRPO通过人类反馈驱动的优化管道有效解决了多人物身份保持问题，显著提升了视频生成中的人物一致性表现。

Abstract: While advanced methods like VACE and Phantom have advanced video generation
for specific subjects in diverse scenarios, they struggle with multi-human
identity preservation in dynamic interactions, where consistent identities
across multiple characters are critical. To address this, we propose
Identity-GRPO, a human feedback-driven optimization pipeline for refining
multi-human identity-preserving video generation. First, we construct a video
reward model trained on a large-scale preference dataset containing
human-annotated and synthetic distortion data, with pairwise annotations
focused on maintaining human consistency throughout the video. We then employ a
GRPO variant tailored for multi-human consistency, which greatly enhances both
VACE and Phantom. Through extensive ablation studies, we evaluate the impact of
annotation quality and design choices on policy optimization. Experiments show
that Identity-GRPO achieves up to 18.9% improvement in human consistency
metrics over baseline methods, offering actionable insights for aligning
reinforcement learning with personalized video generation.

TL;DR: 提出MatchAttention机制和MatchDecoder，通过动态匹配相对位置和分层解码器实现高效跨视图匹配，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率图像的跨视图匹配面临二次复杂度和缺乏显式匹配约束的挑战，现有交叉注意力机制难以有效处理。

Method: 使用MatchAttention动态匹配相对位置，通过BilinearSoftmax实现连续可微的滑动窗口注意力采样，设计MatchDecoder作为核心组件，并引入门控交叉MatchAttention和一致性约束损失处理遮挡问题。

Result: MatchStereo-B在Middlebury基准测试中平均误差排名第一，KITTI分辨率推理仅需29ms；MatchStereo-T仅用3GB GPU内存在0.1秒内处理4K UHD图像，在KITTI 2012/2015、ETH3D和Spring flow数据集上均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高精度、低计算复杂度的跨视图匹配，使实时、高分辨率、高精度的跨视图匹配成为可能。

Abstract: Cross-view matching is fundamentally achieved through cross-attention
mechanisms. However, matching of high-resolution images remains challenging due
to the quadratic complexity and lack of explicit matching constraints in the
existing cross-attention. This paper proposes an attention mechanism,
MatchAttention, that dynamically matches relative positions. The relative
position determines the attention sampling center of the key-value pairs given
a query. Continuous and differentiable sliding-window attention sampling is
achieved by the proposed BilinearSoftmax. The relative positions are
iteratively updated through residual connections across layers by embedding
them into the feature channels. Since the relative position is exactly the
learning target for cross-view matching, an efficient hierarchical cross-view
decoder, MatchDecoder, is designed with MatchAttention as its core component.
To handle cross-view occlusions, gated cross-MatchAttention and a
consistency-constrained loss are proposed. These two components collectively
mitigate the impact of occlusions in both forward and backward passes, allowing
the model to focus more on learning matching relationships. When applied to
stereo matching, MatchStereo-B ranked 1st in average error on the public
Middlebury benchmark and requires only 29ms for KITTI-resolution inference.
MatchStereo-T can process 4K UHD images in 0.1 seconds using only 3GB of GPU
memory. The proposed models also achieve state-of-the-art performance on KITTI
2012, KITTI 2015, ETH3D, and Spring flow datasets. The combination of high
accuracy and low computational complexity makes real-time, high-resolution, and
high-accuracy cross-view matching possible. Code is available at

Abstract: Domain shift in histopathology, often caused by differences in acquisition
processes or data sources, poses a major challenge to the generalization
ability of deep learning models. Existing methods primarily rely on modeling
statistical correlations by aligning feature distributions or introducing
statistical variation, yet they often overlook causal relationships. In this
work, we propose a novel causal-inference-based framework that leverages
semantic features while mitigating the impact of confounders. Our method
implements the front-door principle by designing transformation strategies that
explicitly incorporate mediators and observed tissue slides. We validate our
method on the CAMELYON17 dataset and a private histopathology dataset,
demonstrating consistent performance gains across unseen domains. As a result,
our approach achieved up to a 7% improvement in both the CAMELYON17 dataset and
the private histopathology dataset, outperforming existing baselines. These
results highlight the potential of causal inference as a powerful tool for
addressing domain shift in histopathology image analysis.

Conclusion: 提出的三层对比解码加水印方法能有效减少大视觉语言模型的幻觉问题，提高输出的视觉接地性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently shown promising results on
various multimodal tasks, even achieving human-comparable performance in
certain cases. Nevertheless, LVLMs remain prone to hallucinations -- they often
rely heavily on a single modality or memorize training data without properly
grounding their outputs. To address this, we propose a training-free, tri-layer
contrastive decoding with watermarking, which proceeds in three steps: (1)
select a mature layer and an amateur layer among the decoding layers, (2)
identify a pivot layer using a watermark-related question to assess whether the
layer is visually well-grounded, and (3) apply tri-layer contrastive decoding
to generate the final output. Experiments on public benchmarks such as POPE,
MME and AMBER demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
in reducing hallucinations in LVLMs and generates more visually grounded
responses.

Conclusion: MID-StyleGAN能够生成高质量合成眼部图像，有效解决了虹膜和眼部生物识别中的数据稀缺问题，为呈现攻击检测提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: An iris biometric system can be compromised by presentation attacks (PAs)
where artifacts such as artificial eyes, printed eye images, or cosmetic
contact lenses are presented to the system. To counteract this, several
presentation attack detection (PAD) methods have been developed. However, there
is a scarcity of datasets for training and evaluating iris PAD techniques due
to the implicit difficulties in constructing and imaging PAs. To address this,
we introduce the Multi-domain Image Translative Diffusion StyleGAN
(MID-StyleGAN), a new framework for generating synthetic ocular images that
captures the PA and bonafide characteristics in multiple domains such as
bonafide, printed eyes and cosmetic contact lens. MID-StyleGAN combines the
strengths of diffusion models and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to
produce realistic and diverse synthetic data. Our approach utilizes a
multi-domain architecture that enables the translation between bonafide ocular
images and different PA domains. The model employs an adaptive loss function
tailored for ocular data to maintain domain consistency. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MID-StyleGAN outperforms existing methods in generating
high-quality synthetic ocular images. The generated data was used to
significantly enhance the performance of PAD systems, providing a scalable
solution to the data scarcity problem in iris and ocular biometrics. For
example, on the LivDet2020 dataset, the true detect rate at 1% false detect
rate improved from 93.41% to 98.72%, showcasing the impact of the proposed
method.

Motivation: 主流多模态大语言模型仅通过文本标记的下一个标记预测进行监督，忽略了关键的视觉中心信息，限制了分析能力。

Method: 引入可学习的模块化任务查询和视觉对齐层，在多个视觉基础模型的监督下激活特定视觉信号，并使用令牌网关掩码协调不同模型间的表示冲突。

Result: 大量实验表明VaCo显著提升了不同多模态大语言模型在各种基准测试上的性能。

Conclusion: VaCo展示了在视觉理解方面的卓越能力，为多模态模型提供了更有效的视觉特征整合方法。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) integrate image features from visual
encoders with LLMs, demonstrating advanced comprehension capabilities. However,
mainstream MLLMs are solely supervised by the next-token prediction of textual
tokens, neglecting critical vision-centric information essential for analytical
abilities. To track this dilemma, we introduce VaCo, which optimizes MLLM
representations through Vision-Centric activation and Coordination from
multiple vision foundation models (VFMs). VaCo introduces visual discriminative
alignment to integrate task-aware perceptual features extracted from VFMs,
thereby unifying the optimization of both textual and visual outputs in MLLMs.
Specifically, we incorporate the learnable Modular Task Queries (MTQs) and
Visual Alignment Layers (VALs) into MLLMs, activating specific visual signals
under the supervision of diverse VFMs. To coordinate representation conflicts
across VFMs, the crafted Token Gateway Mask (TGM) restricts the information
flow among multiple groups of MTQs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VaCo
significantly improves the performance of different MLLMs on various
benchmarks, showcasing its superior capabilities in visual comprehension.

cycle-consistent keypoints as salient points to enforce spatial coherence
constraints during matching, improving correspondence accuracy. Additionally,
we introduce a novel pose block that combines a GRU recurrent unit with

TL;DR: SPR方法通过奖励多模态大语言模型生成详细且定位准确的对象描述，来增强其细粒度空间理解能力，而无需大量训练开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在细粒度空间感知能力上不足，如生成详细区域描述或精确定位对象，且无法满足用户对细粒度空间理解的需求。问题源于现有方法主要关注对预标注指令数据的建模，而未直接监督MLLMs的实际响应。

Method: SPR方法通过语义和定位评分全面评估MLLM生成描述的质量，选择最佳定位精度的优化描述与最低分初始描述进行直接偏好优化，从而增强与视觉输入的细粒度对齐。

Result: 在标准引用和定位基准测试上的广泛实验表明，SPR能有效提升MLLM的空间理解能力，且训练开销极小。

Conclusion: SPR通过奖励详细且定位准确的响应，成功增强了MLLMs的细粒度空间理解能力，为解决现有MLLMs在空间感知方面的不足提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models~(MLLMs) have demonstrated promising spatial
understanding capabilities, such as referencing and grounding object
descriptions. Despite their successes, MLLMs still fall short in fine-grained
spatial perception abilities, such as generating detailed region descriptions
or accurately localizing objects. Additionally, they often fail to respond to
the user's requirements for desired fine-grained spatial understanding. This
issue might arise because existing approaches primarily focus on tuning MLLMs
to model pre-annotated instruction data to inject spatial knowledge, without
direct supervision of MLLMs' actual responses. We address this issue by SPR, a
Spatial Preference Rewarding~(SPR) approach that enhances MLLMs' spatial
capabilities by rewarding MLLMs' detailed responses with precise object
localization over vague or inaccurate responses. With randomly selected image
regions and region descriptions from MLLMs, SPR introduces semantic and
localization scores to comprehensively evaluate the text quality and
localization quality in MLLM-generated descriptions. We also refine the MLLM
descriptions with better localization accuracy and pair the best-scored
refinement with the initial descriptions of the lowest score for direct
preference optimization, thereby enhancing fine-grained alignment with visual
input. Extensive experiments over standard referring and grounding benchmarks
show that SPR improves MLLM spatial understanding capabilities effectively with
minimal overhead in training. Data and code will be released at

### [29] [DOS: Directional Object Separation in Text Embeddings for Multi-Object Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14376)
*Dongnam Byun,Jungwon Park,Jumgmin Ko,Changin Choi,Wonjong Rhee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DOS是一种改进多对象图像生成的方法，通过修改CLIP文本嵌入来减少对象忽略和混合问题，在人类评估中显著优于其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成模型在处理包含多个对象的提示时，经常出现对象忽略或对象混合的问题，特别是在相似形状、相似纹理、不同背景偏差和多个对象等场景下。

Method: 提出了DOS方法，该方法在将文本嵌入传递到文本到图像模型之前修改三种类型的CLIP文本嵌入，以实现更好的对象分离。

Result: 实验结果显示，DOS持续提高了多对象图像生成的成功率并减少了对象混合。在人类评估中，DOS在四个基准测试中获得了比其他四种竞争方法多26.24%-43.04%的投票。

Conclusion: DOS是改进多对象图像生成的实用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generative models has led to
significant improvements in generating high-quality images aligned with text
prompts. However, these models still struggle with prompts involving multiple
objects, often resulting in object neglect or object mixing. Through extensive
studies, we identify four problematic scenarios, Similar Shapes, Similar
Textures, Dissimilar Background Biases, and Many Objects, where inter-object
relationships frequently lead to such failures. Motivated by two key
observations about CLIP embeddings, we propose DOS (Directional Object
Separation), a method that modifies three types of CLIP text embeddings before
passing them into text-to-image models. Experimental results show that DOS
consistently improves the success rate of multi-object image generation and
reduces object mixing. In human evaluations, DOS significantly outperforms four
competing methods, receiving 26.24%-43.04% more votes across four benchmarks.
These results highlight DOS as a practical and effective solution for improving
multi-object image generation.

*Danish Ali,Ajmal Mian,Naveed Akhtar,Ghulam Mubashar Hassan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DRBD-Mamba模型，通过双分辨率双向Mamba架构实现高效的3D脑肿瘤分割，在保持高精度的同时显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Mamba模型在脑肿瘤分割中存在计算开销大、多轴特征扫描效率低的问题，且在不同数据划分下的鲁棒性评估不足。

Method: 使用空间填充曲线进行3D到1D特征映射，提出门控融合模块自适应整合双向上下文，采用量化块离散化特征提升鲁棒性。

Result: 在BraTS2023测试集上，全肿瘤、肿瘤核心和增强肿瘤的Dice分别提升0.10%、1.75%和0.93%，计算效率提升15倍。

Conclusion: DRBD-Mamba在保持高分割精度的同时显著提升计算效率，证明了其在脑肿瘤分割中的鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation is significant for clinical diagnosis and
treatment. It is challenging due to the heterogeneity of tumor subregions.
Mamba-based State Space Models have demonstrated promising performance.
However, they incur significant computational overhead due to sequential
feature computation across multiple spatial axes. Moreover, their robustness
across diverse BraTS data partitions remains largely unexplored, leaving a
critical gap in reliable evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose
dual-resolution bi-directional Mamba (DRBD-Mamba), an efficient 3D segmentation
model that captures multi-scale long-range dependencies with minimal
computational overhead. We leverage a space-filling curve to preserve spatial
locality during 3D-to-1D feature mapping, thereby reducing reliance on
computationally expensive multi-axial feature scans. To enrich feature
representation, we propose a gated fusion module that adaptively integrates
forward and reverse contexts, along with a quantization block that discretizes
features to improve robustness. In addition, we propose five systematic folds
on BraTS2023 for rigorous evaluation of segmentation techniques under diverse
conditions and present detailed analysis of common failure scenarios. On the
20\% test set used by recent methods, our model achieves Dice improvements of
0.10\% for whole tumor, 1.75\% for tumor core, and 0.93\% for enhancing tumor.
Evaluations on the proposed systematic five folds demonstrate that our model
maintains competitive whole tumor accuracy while achieving clear average Dice
gains of 0.86\% for tumor core and 1.45\% for enhancing tumor over existing
state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our model attains 15 times improvement in
efficiency while maintaining high segmentation accuracy, highlighting its
robustness and computational advantage over existing approaches.

TL;DR: BoardVision框架用于检测主板组装级缺陷，通过集成YOLOv7和Faster R-CNN模型，提出CTV Voter轻量级集成方法平衡精度和召回率，并评估了在真实扰动下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主板组装级缺陷检测在电子制造中至关重要，但现有研究主要关注裸板或线路级缺陷，组装级检测研究不足。

Method: 使用YOLOv7和Faster R-CNN两种检测器，提出Confidence-Temporal Voting集成方法，在MiracleFactory数据集上系统评估。

Result: YOLOv7精度高但召回率低，Faster R-CNN召回率高但精度低，CTV Voter集成方法有效平衡了精度和召回率。

Conclusion: 计算机视觉技术可从基准测试过渡到实际主板制造质量保证，发布了可部署的GUI检测工具。

Abstract: Motherboard defect detection is critical for ensuring reliability in
high-volume electronics manufacturing. While prior research in PCB inspection
has largely targeted bare-board or trace-level defects, assembly-level
inspection of full motherboards inspection remains underexplored. In this work,
we present BoardVision, a reproducible framework for detecting assembly-level
defects such as missing screws, loose fan wiring, and surface scratches. We
benchmark two representative detectors - YOLOv7 and Faster R-CNN, under
controlled conditions on the MiracleFactory motherboard dataset, providing the
first systematic comparison in this domain. To mitigate the limitations of
single models, where YOLO excels in precision but underperforms in recall and
Faster R-CNN shows the reverse, we propose a lightweight ensemble,
Confidence-Temporal Voting (CTV Voter), that balances precision and recall
through interpretable rules. We further evaluate robustness under realistic
perturbations including sharpness, brightness, and orientation changes,
highlighting stability challenges often overlooked in motherboard defect
detection. Finally, we release a deployable GUI-driven inspection tool that
bridges research evaluation with operator usability. Together, these
contributions demonstrate how computer vision techniques can transition from
benchmark results to practical quality assurance for assembly-level motherboard
manufacturing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学面临千兆像素输入的计算瓶颈和密集标注稀缺的问题，现有方法常忽略多放大倍数下的细粒度信息和肿瘤微环境变化。

Method: 采用易到难的渐进表示学习，结合双课程对比多实例学习，直接处理全切片图像生成预后预测。

Result: 在12种癌症类型（5,954患者，1254万图块）上验证，DCMIL优于标准WSI预后模型，能识别细粒度预后关键区域并提供稳健的不确定性估计。

Conclusion: DCMIL能有效处理WSI进行癌症预后，无需密集标注，具有生成新生物学见解的潜力，所有代码已开源。

Abstract: The burgeoning discipline of computational pathology shows promise in
harnessing whole slide images (WSIs) to quantify morphological heterogeneity
and develop objective prognostic modes for human cancers. However, progress is
impeded by the computational bottleneck of gigapixel-size inputs and the
scarcity of dense manual annotations. Current methods often overlook
fine-grained information across multi-magnification WSIs and variations in
tumor microenvironments. Here, we propose an easy-to-hard progressive
representation learning model, termed dual-curriculum contrastive
multi-instance learning (DCMIL), to efficiently process WSIs for cancer
prognosis. The model does not rely on dense annotations and enables the direct
transformation of gigapixel-size WSIs into outcome predictions. Extensive
experiments on twelve cancer types (5,954 patients, 12.54 million tiles)
demonstrate that DCMIL outperforms standard WSI-based prognostic models.
Additionally, DCMIL identifies fine-grained prognosis-salient regions, provides
robust instance uncertainty estimation, and captures morphological differences
between normal and tumor tissues, with the potential to generate new biological
insights. All codes have been made publicly accessible at

### [33] [Real-Time Neural Video Compression with Unified Intra and Inter Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14431)
*Hui Xiang,Yifan Bian,Li Li,Jingran Wu,Xianguo Zhang,Dong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一帧内和帧间编码的神经视频压缩框架，通过自适应帧内/帧间编码和双向两帧压缩设计，显著提升了压缩效率和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经视频压缩方案在处理遮挡、新内容、帧间误差传播等方面存在不足，需要借鉴传统视频编码中的帧内编码思想来解决这些问题。

Method: 采用统一帧内和帧间编码框架，每个帧由单一模型自适应处理；提出同时两帧压缩设计，利用前向和后向的帧间冗余。

Result: 相比DCVC-RT平均减少10.7%的BD-rate，提供更稳定的比特率和每帧质量，同时保持实时编码/解码性能。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了神经视频压缩中的关键问题，在压缩效率和稳定性方面均有显著提升。

Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) technologies have advanced rapidly in recent
years, yielding state-of-the-art schemes such as DCVC-RT that offer superior
compression efficiency to H.266/VVC and real-time encoding/decoding
capabilities. Nonetheless, existing NVC schemes have several limitations,
including inefficiency in dealing with disocclusion and new content, interframe
error propagation and accumulation, among others. To eliminate these
limitations, we borrow the idea from classic video coding schemes, which allow
intra coding within inter-coded frames. With the intra coding tool enabled,
disocclusion and new content are properly handled, and interframe error
propagation is naturally intercepted without the need for manual refresh
mechanisms. We present an NVC framework with unified intra and inter coding,
where every frame is processed by a single model that is trained to perform
intra/inter coding adaptively. Moreover, we propose a simultaneous two-frame
compression design to exploit interframe redundancy not only forwardly but also
backwardly. Experimental results show that our scheme outperforms DCVC-RT by an
average of 10.7\% BD-rate reduction, delivers more stable bitrate and quality
per frame, and retains real-time encoding/decoding performances. Code and
models will be released.

Motivation: 视频目标检测在安全关键应用中至关重要，但深度学习方法容易受到通用对抗攻击的影响，需要开发更有效的攻击方法。

Method: 使用核范数正则化促进背景集中的结构化扰动，采用自适应乐观指数梯度方法进行高效优化。

Result: 该方法在攻击效果上优于低秩投影梯度下降和Frank-Wolfe方法，同时保持高隐蔽性。

Conclusion: 提出的攻击方法在视频目标检测中表现出优越的性能和隐蔽性，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Video-based object detection plays a vital role in safety-critical
applications. While deep learning-based object detectors have achieved
impressive performance, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly those involving universal perturbations. In this work, we propose
a minimally distorted universal adversarial attack tailored for video object
detection, which leverages nuclear norm regularization to promote structured
perturbations concentrated in the background. To optimize this formulation
efficiently, we employ an adaptive, optimistic exponentiated gradient method
that enhances both scalability and convergence. Our results demonstrate that
the proposed attack outperforms both low-rank projected gradient descent and
Frank-Wolfe based attacks in effectiveness while maintaining high stealthiness.

Abstract: Unsupervised deep generative models are emerging as a promising alternative
to supervised methods for detecting and segmenting anomalies in brain imaging.
Unlike fully supervised approaches, which require large voxel-level annotated
datasets and are limited to well-characterised pathologies, these models can be
trained exclusively on healthy data and identify anomalies as deviations from
learned normative brain structures. This PRISMA-guided scoping review
synthesises recent work on unsupervised deep generative models for anomaly
detection in neuroimaging, including autoencoders, variational autoencoders,
generative adversarial networks, and denoising diffusion models. A total of 49
studies published between 2018 - 2025 were identified, covering applications to
brain MRI and, less frequently, CT across diverse pathologies such as tumours,
stroke, multiple sclerosis, and small vessel disease. Reported performance
metrics are compared alongside architectural design choices. Across the
included studies, generative models achieved encouraging performance for large
focal lesions and demonstrated progress in addressing more subtle
abnormalities. A key strength of generative models is their ability to produce
interpretable pseudo-healthy (also referred to as counterfactual)
reconstructions, which is particularly valuable when annotated data are scarce,
as in rare or heterogeneous diseases. Looking ahead, these models offer a
compelling direction for anomaly detection, enabling semi-supervised learning,
supporting the discovery of novel imaging biomarkers, and facilitating within-
and cross-disease deviation mapping in unified end-to-end frameworks. To
realise clinical impact, future work should prioritise anatomy-aware modelling,
development of foundation models, task-appropriate evaluation metrics, and
rigorous clinical validation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务图像恢复模型参数过多导致计算效率低下，需要在不牺牲性能的前提下压缩模型规模。

Method: 使用迭代剪枝策略，移除低幅值权重并重置剩余权重到原始初始化，发现高性能稀疏子网络。

Result: 在去雨、去雾和去噪任务上，MIR-L模型仅保留10%可训练参数，同时维持高水平的图像恢复性能。

Conclusion: 提出的压缩策略能有效发现高性能稀疏子网络，为多任务图像恢复模型的轻量化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Image quality is a critical factor in delivering visually appealing content
on web platforms. However, images often suffer from degradation due to lossy
operations applied by online social networks (OSNs), negatively affecting user
experience. Image restoration is the process of recovering a clean high-quality
image from a given degraded input. Recently, multi-task (all-in-one) image
restoration models have gained significant attention, due to their ability to
simultaneously handle different types of image degradations. However, these
models often come with an excessively high number of trainable parameters,
making them computationally inefficient. In this paper, we propose a strategy
for compressing multi-task image restoration models. We aim to discover highly
sparse subnetworks within overparameterized deep models that can match or even
surpass the performance of their dense counterparts. The proposed model, namely
MIR-L, utilizes an iterative pruning strategy that removes low-magnitude
weights across multiple rounds, while resetting the remaining weights to their
original initialization. This iterative process is important for the multi-task
image restoration model's optimization, effectively uncovering "winning
tickets" that maintain or exceed state-of-the-art performance at high sparsity
levels. Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets for the deraining,
dehazing, and denoising tasks shows that MIR-L retains only 10% of the
trainable parameters while maintaining high image restoration performance. Our
code, datasets and pre-trained models are made publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放牧活动对农业生产和生物多样性都有重要影响，但目前缺乏可扩展的放牧监测方法。

Method: 基于Sentinel-2 L2A时间序列数据，使用CNN-LSTM集成模型对每个多边形定义的牧场边界进行二分类预测（放牧/未放牧）。

Result: 在五个验证分割上平均F1分数达到77%，对放牧牧场的召回率达到90%。在只能检查4%场地的情况下，优先检查模型预测为未放牧的场地，确认的非放牧场地数量比随机检查多17.2倍。

Conclusion: 粗分辨率、免费可用的卫星数据能够可靠地指导检查资源，用于保护性土地利用的合规监测。

Abstract: Grazing shapes both agricultural production and biodiversity, yet scalable
monitoring of where grazing occurs remains limited. We study seasonal grazing
detection from Sentinel-2 L2A time series: for each polygon-defined field
boundary, April-October imagery is used for binary prediction (grazed / not
grazed). We train an ensemble of CNN-LSTM models on multi-temporal reflectance
features, and achieve an average F1 score of 77 percent across five validation
splits, with 90 percent recall on grazed pastures. Operationally, if inspectors
can visit at most 4 percent of sites annually, prioritising fields predicted by
our model as non-grazed yields 17.2 times more confirmed non-grazing sites than
random inspection. These results indicate that coarse-resolution, freely
available satellite data can reliably steer inspection resources for
conservation-aligned land-use compliance. Code and models have been made
publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mamba相比Vision Transformers(ViTs)具有线性计算复杂度而非二次复杂度，且比传统CNN需要更少的可训练参数，这使其在计算和内存效率方面更具优势，适合用于三维多孔介质渗透率预测任务。

Method: 使用Vision Mamba作为骨干网络构建神经网络模型，用于预测三维多孔介质的渗透率。通过与ViT和CNN模型进行性能比较，并进行消融研究评估各组件对准确性的影响。

Result: 实践证明了Vision Mamba在三维多孔介质渗透率预测中相比ViTs和CNNs的上述优势，包括更好的计算效率和内存效率。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架有潜力集成到大型视觉模型中，用Vision Mamba替代ViTs，为相关研究提供了可复现的源代码。

Abstract: Vision Mamba has recently received attention as an alternative to Vision
Transformers (ViTs) for image classification. The network size of Vision Mamba
scales linearly with input image resolution, whereas ViTs scale quadratically,
a feature that improves computational and memory efficiency. Moreover, Vision
Mamba requires a significantly smaller number of trainable parameters than
traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and thus, they can be more
memory efficient. Because of these features, we introduce, for the first time,
a neural network that uses Vision Mamba as its backbone for predicting the
permeability of three-dimensional porous media. We compare the performance of
Vision Mamba with ViT and CNN models across multiple aspects of permeability
prediction and perform an ablation study to assess the effects of its
components on accuracy. We demonstrate in practice the aforementioned
advantages of Vision Mamba over ViTs and CNNs in the permeability prediction of
three-dimensional porous media. We make the source code publicly available to
facilitate reproducibility and to enable other researchers to build on and
extend this work. We believe the proposed framework has the potential to be
integrated into large vision models in which Vision Mamba is used instead of
ViTs.

Abstract: Defective surgical instruments pose serious risks to sterility, mechanical
integrity, and patient safety, increasing the likelihood of surgical
complications. However, quality control in surgical instrument manufacturing
often relies on manual inspection, which is prone to human error and
inconsistency. This study introduces SurgScan, an AI-powered defect detection
framework for surgical instruments. Using YOLOv8, SurgScan classifies defects

trained on a high-resolution dataset of 102,876 images, covering 11 instrument
types and five major defect categories. Extensive evaluation against
state-of-the-art CNN architectures confirms that SurgScan achieves the highest
accuracy (99.3%) with real-time inference speeds of 4.2-5.8 ms per image,
making it suitable for industrial deployment. Statistical analysis demonstrates
that contrast-enhanced preprocessing significantly improves defect detection,
addressing key limitations in visual inspection. SurgScan provides a scalable,
cost-effective AI solution for automated quality control, reducing reliance on
manual inspection while ensuring compliance with ISO 13485 and FDA standards,
paving the way for enhanced defect detection in medical manufacturing.

TL;DR: 提出一种噪声投影器，通过在去噪前对初始噪声进行文本条件细化，将噪声映射到与训练分布更匹配的提示感知对应物，从而改善文本-图像对齐，无需修改SD模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成中的训练-推理不匹配问题：训练时提示条件噪声位于潜在空间的提示特定子集，而推理时噪声从提示无关的高斯先验中采样，导致某些图像与提示对齐不佳。

Method: 设计噪声投影器框架：采样噪声并获取视觉语言模型的token级反馈，将这些信号蒸馏到奖励模型中，通过准直接偏好优化优化噪声投影器。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，提示感知的噪声投影改善了不同提示下的文本-图像对齐。

Conclusion: 提出的方法无需参考图像或手工先验，推理成本小，用单次前向传播替代多样本选择，有效提升了文本到图像生成的对齐质量。

Abstract: In text-to-image generation, different initial noises induce distinct
denoising paths with a pretrained Stable Diffusion (SD) model. While this
pattern could output diverse images, some of them may fail to align well with
the prompt. Existing methods alleviate this issue either by altering the
denoising dynamics or by drawing multiple noises and conducting post-selection.
In this paper, we attribute the misalignment to a training-inference mismatch:
during training, prompt-conditioned noises lie in a prompt-specific subset of
the latent space, whereas at inference the noise is drawn from a
prompt-agnostic Gaussian prior. To close this gap, we propose a noise projector
that applies text-conditioned refinement to the initial noise before denoising.
Conditioned on the prompt embedding, it maps the noise to a prompt-aware
counterpart that better matches the distribution observed during SD training,
without modifying the SD model. Our framework consists of these steps: we first
sample some noises and obtain token-level feedback for their corresponding
images from a vision-language model (VLM), then distill these signals into a
reward model, and finally optimize the noise projector via a quasi-direct
preference optimization. Our design has two benefits: (i) it requires no
reference images or handcrafted priors, and (ii) it incurs small inference
cost, replacing multi-sample selection with a single forward pass. Extensive
experiments further show that our prompt-aware noise projection improves
text-image alignment across diverse prompts.

Abstract: Oral and maxillofacial radiology plays a vital role in dental healthcare, but
radiographic image interpretation is limited by a shortage of trained
professionals. While AI approaches have shown promise, existing dental AI
systems are restricted by their single-modality focus, task-specific design,
and reliance on costly labeled data, hindering their generalization across
diverse clinical scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce DentVFM,
the first family of vision foundation models (VFMs) designed for dentistry.
DentVFM generates task-agnostic visual representations for a wide range of
dental applications and uses self-supervised learning on DentVista, a large
curated dental imaging dataset with approximately 1.6 million multi-modal
radiographic images from various medical centers. DentVFM includes 2D and 3D
variants based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. To address gaps in
dental intelligence assessment and benchmarks, we introduce DentBench, a
comprehensive benchmark covering eight dental subspecialties, more diseases,
imaging modalities, and a wide geographical distribution. DentVFM shows
impressive generalist intelligence, demonstrating robust generalization to
diverse dental tasks, such as disease diagnosis, treatment analysis, biomarker
identification, and anatomical landmark detection and segmentation.
Experimental results indicate DentVFM significantly outperforms supervised,
self-supervised, and weakly supervised baselines, offering superior
generalization, label efficiency, and scalability. Additionally, DentVFM
enables cross-modality diagnostics, providing more reliable results than
experienced dentists in situations where conventional imaging is unavailable.
DentVFM sets a new paradigm for dental AI, offering a scalable, adaptable, and
label-efficient model to improve intelligent dental healthcare and address
critical gaps in global oral healthcare.

*Keima Abe,Hayato Muraki,Shuhei Tomoshige,Kenichi Oishi,Hitoshi Iyatomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PL-SE-ADA框架，用于医学图像领域自适应和可解释表示学习，通过分离域不变和域特定特征来提升脑部MR图像的疾病分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像（如MR扫描）存在跨成像站点的域偏移问题，这会降低机器学习在疾病分类等任务中的性能。现有方法缺乏可解释性，这在医疗应用中至关重要。

Method: 使用两个编码器分别提取域不变特征和域特定特征，通过解码器重建图像，并结合对抗训练确保特征分离。模型通过求和重建来保持信息的完整性。

Result: 与现有方法相比，PL-SE-ADA在图像重建、疾病分类和域识别方面达到同等或更好的性能，同时提供了高可解释性。

Conclusion: PL-SE-ADA是一个有效的领域自适应框架，不仅提升了性能，还通过可视化域独立和域特定组件提供了高可解释性，满足了医疗应用的需求。

Abstract: Medical images like MR scans often show domain shifts across imaging sites
due to scanner and protocol differences, which degrade machine learning
performance in tasks such as disease classification. Domain harmonization is
thus a critical research focus. Recent approaches encode brain images
$\boldsymbol{x}$ into a low-dimensional latent space $\boldsymbol{z}$, then
disentangle it into $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ (domain-invariant) and
$\boldsymbol{z_d}$ (domain-specific), achieving strong results. However, these
methods often lack interpretability$-$an essential requirement in medical
applications$-$leaving practical issues unresolved. We propose
Pseudo-Linear-Style Encoder Adversarial Domain Adaptation (PL-SE-ADA), a
general framework for domain harmonization and interpretable representation
learning that preserves disease-relevant information in brain MR images.
PL-SE-ADA includes two encoders $f_E$ and $f_{SE}$ to extract
$\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and $\boldsymbol{z_d}$, a decoder to reconstruct the image
$f_D$, and a domain predictor $g_D$. Beyond adversarial training between the
encoder and domain predictor, the model learns to reconstruct the input image
$\boldsymbol{x}$ by summing reconstructions from $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and
$\boldsymbol{z_d}$, ensuring both harmonization and informativeness. Compared
to prior methods, PL-SE-ADA achieves equal or better performance in image
reconstruction, disease classification, and domain recognition. It also enables
visualization of both domain-independent brain features and domain-specific
components, offering high interpretability across the entire framework.

TL;DR: VisualSplit框架将图像分解为解耦的经典视觉描述符（如边缘、颜色、强度分布），通过重建驱动的预训练方案学习每个描述符的本质，同时保持可解释性，并在图像生成和编辑等高级视觉任务中实现有效的属性控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在图像理解任务中取得了显著进展，但其内部表示往往不透明，难以解释视觉信息的处理方式。而经典视觉描述符长期以来一直是图像分析的基础，并且对人类来说直观易懂。现代学习能否从这些经典线索中受益？

Method: 提出VisualSplit框架，明确将图像分解为解耦的经典描述符，将每个描述符视为独立但互补的视觉知识组件。通过重建驱动的预训练方案，学习捕捉每个视觉描述符的本质，同时保持其可解释性。

Result: 通过明确分解视觉属性，该方法在图像生成和编辑等各种高级视觉任务中固有地促进了有效的属性控制，超越了传统的分类和分割任务。

Conclusion: 这种新的学习方法在视觉理解方面具有有效性，表明现代学习可以从经典视觉线索中受益，为图像表示提供了更可解释和可控的框架。

Abstract: Exploring and understanding efficient image representations is a
long-standing challenge in computer vision. While deep learning has achieved
remarkable progress across image understanding tasks, its internal
representations are often opaque, making it difficult to interpret how visual
information is processed. In contrast, classical visual descriptors (e.g. edge,
colour, and intensity distribution) have long been fundamental to image
analysis and remain intuitively understandable to humans. Motivated by this
gap, we ask a central question: Can modern learning benefit from these
classical cues? In this paper, we answer it with VisualSplit, a framework that
explicitly decomposes images into decoupled classical descriptors, treating
each as an independent but complementary component of visual knowledge. Through
a reconstruction-driven pre-training scheme, VisualSplit learns to capture the
essence of each visual descriptor while preserving their interpretability. By
explicitly decomposing visual attributes, our method inherently facilitates
effective attribute control in various advanced visual tasks, including image
generation and editing, extending beyond conventional classification and
segmentation, suggesting the effectiveness of this new learning approach for
visual understanding. Project page: https://chenyuanqu.com/VisualSplit/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Flow Matching Alignment (FMA)的多步调整方法，用于解决跨模态特征对齐问题，相比现有的一步参数高效微调方法，在多步校正能力上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的参数高效微调方法都采用一步调整策略，对于特征高度纠缠的复杂数据集来说不够充分，需要更精细的多步调整来实现更精确和鲁棒的对齐。

Method: 提出模型无关的多步调整方法FMA，通过学习跨模态速度场实现特征对齐。具体包括：固定耦合策略确保类别对应、噪声增强策略缓解数据稀缺问题、早停求解器提高效率和精度。

Result: 在多个基准测试和骨干网络上，FMA都能带来显著的性能提升，特别是在具有挑战性的数据集上表现突出。

Conclusion: FMA通过多步校正能力实现了比一步PEFT方法更精确和鲁棒的特征对齐，为跨模态任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Aligning features from different modalities, is one of the most fundamental
challenges for cross-modal tasks. Although pre-trained vision-language models
can achieve a general alignment between image and text, they often require
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for further adjustment. Today's PEFT
methods (e.g., prompt tuning, LoRA-based, or adapter-based) always selectively
fine-tune a subset of parameters, which can slightly adjust either visual or
textual features, and avoid overfitting. In this paper, we are the first to
highlight that all existing PEFT methods perform one-step adjustment. It is
insufficient for complex (or difficult) datasets, where features of different
modalities are highly entangled. To this end, we propose the first
model-agnostic multi-step adjustment approach by learning a cross-modal
velocity field: Flow Matching Alignment (FMA). Specifically, to ensure the
correspondence between categories during training, we first utilize a fixed
coupling strategy. Then, we propose a noise augmentation strategy to alleviate
the data scarcity issue. Finally, we design an early-stopping solver, which
terminates the transformation process earlier, improving both efficiency and
accuracy. Compared with one-step PEFT methods, FMA has the multi-step
rectification ability to achieve more precise and robust alignment. Extensive
results have demonstrated that FMA can consistently yield significant
performance gains across various benchmarks and backbones, particularly on
challenging datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Scene De-Contextualization (SDeC)的训练免费方法，通过抑制文本到图像生成中主体与场景的自然相关性来解决身份偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像生成中存在身份偏移问题，现有方法通常需要预先知道所有目标场景，这在现实中不切实际。研究发现身份偏移的主要来源是主体与场景上下文之间的自然相关性。

Method: 提出SDeC方法，通过量化SVD方向稳定性来自适应重新加权特征值，识别并抑制ID提示嵌入中的潜在场景-身份相关性，实现场景去上下文化。

Result: 实验证明SDeC显著增强了身份保持能力，同时保持了场景多样性，且无需预先知道所有目标场景。

Conclusion: SDeC是一种高效、灵活且通用的解决方案，适用于现实世界应用，能够有效解决身份偏移问题。

Abstract: Consistent text-to-image (T2I) generation seeks to produce
identity-preserving images of the same subject across diverse scenes, yet it
often fails due to a phenomenon called identity (ID) shift. Previous methods
have tackled this issue, but typically rely on the unrealistic assumption of
knowing all target scenes in advance. This paper reveals that a key source of
ID shift is the native correlation between subject and scene context, called
scene contextualization, which arises naturally as T2I models fit the training
distribution of vast natural images. We formally prove the near-universality of
this scene-ID correlation and derive theoretical bounds on its strength. On
this basis, we propose a novel, efficient, training-free prompt embedding
editing approach, called Scene De-Contextualization (SDeC), that imposes an
inversion process of T2I's built-in scene contextualization. Specifically, it
identifies and suppresses the latent scene-ID correlation within the ID
prompt's embedding by quantifying the SVD directional stability to adaptively
re-weight the corresponding eigenvalues. Critically, SDeC allows for per-scene
use (one scene per prompt) without requiring prior access to all target scenes.
This makes it a highly flexible and general solution well-suited to real-world
applications where such prior knowledge is often unavailable or varies over
time. Experiments demonstrate that SDeC significantly enhances identity
preservation while maintaining scene diversity.

TL;DR: BalanceGS是一个针对3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)训练效率优化的算法-系统协同设计，通过密度控制、自适应工作负载分配和内存访问优化，实现了1.44倍的训练加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3DGS训练存在三个关键效率问题：高斯密度分配不均、计算工作负载不平衡以及内存访问碎片化，这些问题限制了训练效率。

Method: 1) 算法层面：启发式工作负载敏感高斯密度控制，平衡点分布；2) 系统层面：基于相似性的高斯采样和合并，实现自适应工作负载分配；3) 映射层面：基于重排序的内存访问映射策略，优化RGB存储。

Result: 在NVIDIA A100 GPU上实现了1.44倍的训练加速，同时质量损失可忽略不计。

Conclusion: BalanceGS通过算法-系统协同设计有效解决了3DGS训练中的效率瓶颈，显著提升了训练速度而不牺牲重建质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising 3D reconstruction
technique. The traditional 3DGS training pipeline follows three sequential
steps: Gaussian densification, Gaussian projection, and color splatting.
Despite its promising reconstruction quality, this conventional approach
suffers from three critical inefficiencies: (1) Skewed density allocation
during Gaussian densification, (2) Imbalanced computation workload during
Gaussian projection and (3) Fragmented memory access during color splatting.
  To tackle the above challenges, we introduce BalanceGS, the algorithm-system
co-design for efficient training in 3DGS. (1) At the algorithm level, we
propose heuristic workload-sensitive Gaussian density control to automatically
balance point distributions - removing 80% redundant Gaussians in dense regions
while filling gaps in sparse areas. (2) At the system level, we propose
Similarity-based Gaussian sampling and merging, which replaces the static
one-to-one thread-pixel mapping with adaptive workload distribution - threads
now dynamically process variable numbers of Gaussians based on local cluster
density. (3) At the mapping level, we propose reordering-based memory access
mapping strategy that restructures RGB storage and enables batch loading in
shared memory.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with 3DGS, our approach
achieves a 1.44$\times$ training speedup on a NVIDIA A100 GPU with negligible
quality degradation.

Conclusion: 将曲率信息整合到深度学习架构中具有有效性，多分支特征学习对基于LiDAR点云的车辆重识别有益。

Abstract: This paper presents CALM-Net, a curvature-aware LiDAR point cloud-based
multi-branch neural network for vehicle re-identification. The proposed model
addresses the challenge of learning discriminative and complementary features
from three-dimensional point clouds to distinguish between vehicles. CALM-Net
employs a multi-branch architecture that integrates edge convolution, point
attention, and a curvature embedding that characterizes local surface variation
in point clouds. By combining these mechanisms, the model learns richer
geometric and contextual features that are well suited for the
re-identification task. Experimental evaluation on the large-scale nuScenes
dataset demonstrates that CALM-Net achieves a mean re-identification accuracy
improvement of approximately 1.97\% points compared with the strongest baseline
in our study. The results confirms the effectiveness of incorporating curvature
information into deep learning architectures and highlight the benefit of
multi-branch feature learning for LiDAR point cloud-based vehicle
re-identification.

Result: 在LlamaPointInPart数据集上相比基线模型表现出优越性能

Conclusion: 该双向框架为关键点引导的图像理解和语言引导的精确定位开辟了新应用前景

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in cross-modal
understanding. Yet, these models remain limited to object-level or region-level
grounding, lacking the capability for pixel-precise keypoint comprehension
through natural language. We introduce a novel framework for pixel level
grounding. The framework consists of two complementary components: a Point
Descriptor that generates rich, contextual descriptions of individual
keypoints, and a Point Localizer that regresses precise pixel coordinates from
these descriptions. Unlike prior work that relies on templated prompts or
keypoint names, our approach produces free-form, coarse-to-fine descriptions
that situate keypoints within their visual context. Since there is no available
dataset to train such a system, we introduce LlamaPointInPart, a carefully
curated dataset of 20K+ image-keypoint-description triplets synthesized from
multiple vision-language models, capturing multi-scale information from
scene-level context to visual features around the keypoint. For cross-category
generalization, we optimize the Point Descriptor on AP-10K via GRPO, using the
frozen Point Localizer as a reward model to produce descriptions that maximize
localization accuracy. To evaluate our results we establish a new evaluation
protocol. Instead of comparing the text description produced by our method to
the ground truth, we use the localizer to determine how close is the predicted
point generated to the ground truth point. Experiments demonstrate superior
performance compared to baseline models on LlamaPointInPart.The bidirectional
nature of our framework should enable future applications in both
keypoint-guided image understanding and language-guided precise localization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频生成在视觉质量上取得进展，但保持连贯的对象运动和交互仍然困难，主要瓶颈包括运动提示编码后有效token过少，以及外观和运动优化冲突。

Method: 使用实例线索将稀疏用户可编辑提示转换为密集2.5D运动场，结合Dense RoPE在token空间保持运动线索显著性，并采用RGB+辅助图联合预测。

Result: 该方法减少了深度模糊，稳定了优化过程，提高了时间一致性。

Conclusion: STANCE框架有效解决了视频生成中的运动一致性问题，通过简单组件实现了更好的对象运动和交互控制。

Abstract: Video generation has recently made striking visual progress, but maintaining
coherent object motion and interactions remains difficult. We trace two
practical bottlenecks: (i) human-provided motion hints (e.g., small 2D maps)
often collapse to too few effective tokens after encoding, weakening guidance;
and (ii) optimizing for appearance and motion in a single head can favor
texture over temporal consistency. We present STANCE, an image-to-video
framework that addresses both issues with two simple components. First, we
introduce Instance Cues -- a pixel-aligned control signal that turns sparse,
user-editable hints into a dense 2.5D (camera-relative) motion field by
averaging per-instance flow and augmenting with monocular depth over the
instance mask. This reduces depth ambiguity compared to 2D arrow inputs while
remaining easy to use. Second, we preserve the salience of these cues in token
space with Dense RoPE, which tags a small set of motion tokens (anchored on the
first frame) with spatial-addressable rotary embeddings. Paired with joint RGB
\(+\) auxiliary-map prediction (segmentation or depth), our model anchors
structure while RGB handles appearance, stabilizing optimization and improving
temporal coherence without requiring per-frame trajectory scripts.

Result: 在E-VQA和InfoSeek基准数据集上分别获得36.0和42.8的显著改进，实现了最先进的性能

Conclusion: Wiki-PRF方法通过三阶段处理和强化学习训练，有效提升了KB-VQA任务中多模态知识检索和答案生成的质量

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires visual language
models (VLMs) to integrate visual understanding with external knowledge
retrieval. Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) achieves significant
advances in this task by combining knowledge-base querying, it still struggles
with the quality of multimodal queries and the relevance of retrieved results.
To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel three-stage method, termed
Wiki-PRF, including Processing, Retrieval and Filtering stages. The processing
stage dynamically invokes visual tools to extract precise multimodal
information for retrieval. The retrieval stage integrates visual and text
features to achieve multimodal knowledge retrieval. The filtering stage
performs relevance filtering and concentration on retrieval results. To this
end, we introduce a visual language model trained with answer accuracy and
format consistency as reward signals via a reinforcement learning manner. This
enhances the model's reasoning, tool invocation for accurate queries, and
filtering of irrelevant content. Experiments on benchmark datasets (E-VQA and
InfoSeek) show significant improvements~(36.0 and 42.8) in answer quality,
achieving state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at

temporal multi-scale video captioning in badminton, capable of generating
shot-level captions that describe individual actions and tactic-level captions
that capture how these actions unfold over time within a tactical execution. We
also introduce the Shot2Tactic-Caption Dataset, the first badminton captioning
dataset containing 5,494 shot captions and 544 tactic captions.
Shot2Tactic-Caption adopts a dual-branch design, with both branches including a
visual encoder, a spatio-temporal Transformer encoder, and a Transformer-based
decoder to generate shot and tactic captions. To support tactic captioning, we
additionally introduce a Tactic Unit Detector that identifies valid tactic
units, tactic types, and tactic states (e.g., Interrupt, Resume). For tactic
captioning, we further incorporate a shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism, where
the predicted tactic type and state are embedded as prompts and injected into
the decoder via cross-attention. The shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism enables
our system not only to describe successfully executed tactics but also to
capture tactical executions that are temporarily interrupted and later resumed.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
generating both shot and tactic captions. Ablation studies show that the
ResNet50-based spatio-temporal encoder outperforms other variants, and that
shot-wise prompt structuring leads to more coherent and accurate tactic
captioning.

TL;DR: EVS是一种简单即插即用的视频采样方法，通过识别和修剪时间上静态的补丁来减少视频中的令牌冗余，从而显著降低令牌数量并保持语义保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型从静态图像理解扩展到视频推理时，处理密集帧序列的二次成本限制了其可扩展性。长视频常常超过现代语言模型的令牌预算，导致严重的上下文限制和延迟问题。

Method: EVS通过识别和修剪时间上静态的补丁（在连续帧中保持不变的空间区域）来减少视频令牌冗余。该方法保持位置身份，无需架构更改或重新训练。

Result: EVS显著减少了令牌数量，同时保持语义保真度，实现了更快的推理和更长的输入序列。在推理时应用，EVS将大型语言模型的首次令牌时间减少了高达4倍，且精度损失最小。

Conclusion: EVS持续改善了效率-准确性的权衡，在不牺牲质量的情况下实现了可扩展的视频语言理解。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently expanded from static image
understanding to video reasoning, but their scalability is fundamentally
limited by the quadratic cost of processing dense frame sequences. Long videos
often exceed the token budget of modern language models, leading to severe
context limitations and latency issues. We introduce Efficient Video Sampling
(EVS), a simple, plug-and-play method for reducing token redundancy in videos
by identifying and pruning temporally static patches -- spatial regions that
remain unchanged across consecutive frames. EVS preserves positional identity,
requires no architectural changes or retraining. We show that EVS substantially
reduces token count while maintaining semantic fidelity, enabling faster
inference and longer input sequences. Applied at inference time, EVS reduces
large language model (LLM) time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 4x with minimal
accuracy loss. When combined with an uptraining phase using stochastic pruning
rates, EVS yields models that are robust to varying compression levels and
retain full performance under aggressive pruning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EVS consistently improves efficiency-accuracy trade-offs,
unlocking scalable video-language understanding without sacrificing quality.

TL;DR: RepTok是一个生成建模框架，使用自监督视觉变换器生成的单个连续潜在token来表示图像，通过微调语义token嵌入和生成解码器，实现高效图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决2D潜在空间的空间冗余问题，降低训练成本，同时保持自监督学习空间的良好几何特性，实现高效的生成建模。

Method: 基于预训练的SSL编码器，仅微调语义token嵌入，与使用流匹配目标的生成解码器联合训练，添加余弦相似度损失来正则化适应后的token。

Result: 在类别条件ImageNet生成上取得竞争性结果，自然扩展到文本到图像合成，在MS-COCO上以极有限的训练预算达到竞争性的零样本性能。

Conclusion: 微调的SSL表示可以作为紧凑有效的潜在空间，用于高效的生成建模，解决了空间冗余和训练成本问题。

Abstract: We introduce Representation Tokenizer (RepTok), a generative modeling
framework that represents an image using a single continuous latent token
obtained from self-supervised vision transformers. Building on a pre-trained
SSL encoder, we fine-tune only the semantic token embedding and pair it with a
generative decoder trained jointly using a standard flow matching objective.
This adaptation enriches the token with low-level, reconstruction-relevant
details, enabling faithful image reconstruction. To preserve the favorable
geometry of the original SSL space, we add a cosine-similarity loss that
regularizes the adapted token, ensuring the latent space remains smooth and
suitable for generation. Our single-token formulation resolves spatial
redundancies of 2D latent spaces and significantly reduces training costs.
Despite its simplicity and efficiency, RepTok achieves competitive results on
class-conditional ImageNet generation and naturally extends to text-to-image
synthesis, reaching competitive zero-shot performance on MS-COCO under
extremely limited training budgets. Our findings highlight the potential of
fine-tuned SSL representations as compact and effective latent spaces for
efficient generative modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于扩散的测试时自适应方法依赖梯度引导、限制探索和跨失真类型泛化能力的问题。

Method: 采用Feynman-Kac引导机制，通过伪标签驱动的奖励来指导扩散输入自适应，维护多个粒子轨迹，结合累积top-K概率和熵调度来平衡探索与置信度。

Result: 在ImageNet-C数据集上，SteeringTTA无需任何模型更新或源数据，持续优于基线方法。

Conclusion: SteeringTTA框架通过引导机制有效提升了测试时自适应的性能，在分布偏移下表现出更好的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to correct performance degradation of deep
models under distribution shifts by updating models or inputs using unlabeled
test data. Input-only diffusion-based TTA methods improve robustness for
classification to corruptions but rely on gradient guidance, limiting
exploration and generalization across distortion types. We propose SteeringTTA,
an inference-only framework that adapts Feynman-Kac steering to guide
diffusion-based input adaptation for classification with rewards driven by
pseudo-label. SteeringTTA maintains multiple particle trajectories, steered by
a combination of cumulative top-K probabilities and an entropy schedule, to
balance exploration and confidence. On ImageNet-C, SteeringTTA consistently
outperforms the baseline without any model updates or source data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于指令的视频编辑由于构建大规模配对视频编辑数据集的成本和复杂性而发展缓慢，需要解决这一挑战。

Method: 首先在约100万个真实视频剪辑上进行预训练学习基本编辑概念，然后在少于15万个精选编辑对上进行微调，扩展更多编辑任务并提高编辑质量。

Result: 该方法在指令对齐和视觉保真度方面均优于现有基于指令的视频编辑方法，编辑指令遵循度提高12%，编辑质量提高15%。

Conclusion: 提出的预训练策略能够有效赋予基础视频生成模型通用编辑能力，并通过少量高质量数据微调显著提升性能。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of instruction-based image editing, its extension
to video remains underexplored, primarily due to the prohibitive cost and
complexity of constructing large-scale paired video editing datasets. To
address this challenge, we introduce a low-cost pretraining strategy for
instruction-based video editing that leverages in-context learning from
unpaired video clips. We show that pretraining a foundation video generation
model with this strategy endows it with general editing capabilities, such as
adding, replacing, or deleting operations, according to input editing
instructions. The pretrained model can then be efficiently refined with a small
amount of high-quality paired editing data. Built upon HunyuanVideoT2V, our
framework first pretrains on approximately 1M real video clips to learn basic
editing concepts, and subsequently fine-tunes on fewer than 150k curated
editing pairs to extend more editing tasks and improve the editing quality.
Comparative experiments show that our method surpasses existing
instruction-based video editing approaches in both instruction alignment and
visual fidelity, achieving a 12\% improvement in editing instruction following
and a 15\% improvement in editing quality.

TL;DR: 将去相关反向传播(DBP)集成到MAE预训练中，通过减少输入相关性来加速收敛，在保持性能的同时显著降低训练时间和碳排放


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAE预训练虽然性能优异但计算成本高昂，在时间和资源受限的工业环境中不实用

Method: 在MAE预训练的编码器中选择性应用DBP优化方法，迭代减少每层的输入相关性

Result: DBP-MAE将达到基线性能的预训练时间减少21.1%，碳排放降低21.4%，分割mIoU提高1.1个百分点

Conclusion: DBP能够在大规模ViT预训练中同时减少训练时间、能源使用并提升下游性能

Abstract: Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pre-training of vision transformers (ViTs) yields
strong performance in low-label regimes but comes with substantial
computational costs, making it impractical in time- and resource-constrained
industrial settings. We address this by integrating Decorrelated
Backpropagation (DBP) into MAE pre-training, an optimization method that
iteratively reduces input correlations at each layer to accelerate convergence.
Applied selectively to the encoder, DBP achieves faster pre-training without
loss of stability. On ImageNet-1K pre-training with ADE20K fine-tuning, DBP-MAE
reduces wall-clock time to baseline performance by 21.1%, lowers carbon
emissions by 21.4% and improves segmentation mIoU by 1.1 points. We observe
similar gains when pre-training and fine-tuning on proprietary industrial data,
confirming the method's applicability in real-world scenarios. These results
demonstrate that DBP can reduce training time and energy use while improving
downstream performance for large-scale ViT pre-training.

Motivation: 采矿活动是环境退化的主要来源，但现有数据集在时间深度或地理范围上有限，需要长期一致的采矿诱发地表变化监测来支持可持续资源管理和环境治理。

Method: 构建EuroMineNet数据集，包含欧盟133个采矿点的年度Sentinel-2多光谱影像和专家验证标注，支持两个任务：(1)多时相采矿足迹测绘，使用新的变化感知时序IoU指标评估；(2)跨时序变化检测以捕捉渐进和突变的地表变化。

Conclusion: EuroMineNet通过推进时间一致且可解释的采矿监测，有助于可持续土地利用管理、环境韧性，以及应用GeoAI促进社会和环境福祉的更广泛目标。

Abstract: Mining activities are essential for industrial and economic development, but
remain a leading source of environmental degradation, contributing to
deforestation, soil erosion, and water contamination. Sustainable resource
management and environmental governance require consistent, long-term
monitoring of mining-induced land surface changes, yet existing datasets are
often limited in temporal depth or geographic scope. To address this gap, we
present EuroMineNet, the first comprehensive multitemporal benchmark for mining
footprint mapping and monitoring based on Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery.
Spanning 133 mining sites across the European Union, EuroMineNet provides
annual observations and expert-verified annotations from 2015 to 2024, enabling
GeoAI-based models to analyze environmental dynamics at a continental scale. It
supports two sustainability-driven tasks: (1) multitemporal mining footprint
mapping for consistent annual land-use delineation, evaluated with a novel
Change-Aware Temporal IoU (CA-TIoU) metric, and (2) cross-temporal change
detection to capture both gradual and abrupt surface transformations.
Benchmarking 20 state-of-the-art deep learning models reveals that while GeoAI
methods effectively identify long-term environmental changes, challenges remain
in detecting short-term dynamics critical for timely mitigation. By advancing
temporally consistent and explainable mining monitoring, EuroMineNet
contributes to sustainable land-use management, environmental resilience, and
the broader goal of applying GeoAI for social and environmental good. We
release the codes and datasets by aligning with FAIR and the open science
paradigm at https://github.com/EricYu97/EuroMineNet.

TL;DR: 提出了首个弱监督链式知识蒸馏网络WeCKD，通过构建渐进式蒸馏链，让每个模型不仅从前驱学习知识，还对其进行精炼后再传递，从而在有限数据场景下实现高效知识迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏依赖静态师生框架，存在知识退化、监督效率低、需要强教师模型或大数据集等问题，限制了在真实世界有限数据场景下的有效性。

Method: 构建弱监督链式知识蒸馏网络，形成渐进式蒸馏链，每个模型仅使用部分数据集进行训练，从前驱模型学习并精炼知识后传递给后续模型。

Result: 在四个耳镜成像数据集上的评估显示，该方法不仅匹配甚至超越现有监督方法性能，在两个其他数据集上的实验进一步验证了其在不同医学成像模态（包括显微和磁共振成像）上的泛化能力，相比单骨干网络在相同有限数据下实现了高达+23%的累积准确率提升。

Conclusion: WeCKD通过结构化知识转移链有效增强了特征学习，降低了数据依赖性，缓解了一步式知识蒸馏的局限性，展示了在真实世界应用中利用最小监督实现有效学习的潜力。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has traditionally relied on a static
teacher-student framework, where a large, well-trained teacher transfers
knowledge to a single student model. However, these approaches often suffer
from knowledge degradation, inefficient supervision, and reliance on either a
very strong teacher model or large labeled datasets, which limits their
effectiveness in real-world, limited-data scenarios. To address these, we
present the first-ever Weakly-supervised Chain-based KD network (WeCKD) that
redefines knowledge transfer through a structured sequence of interconnected
models. Unlike conventional KD, it forms a progressive distillation chain,
where each model not only learns from its predecessor but also refines the
knowledge before passing it forward. This structured knowledge transfer further
enhances feature learning, reduces data dependency, and mitigates the
limitations of one-step KD. Each model in the distillation chain is trained on
only a fraction of the dataset and demonstrates that effective learning can be
achieved with minimal supervision. Extensive evaluations across four otoscopic
imaging datasets demonstrate that it not only matches but in many cases
surpasses the performance of existing supervised methods. Experimental results
on two other datasets further underscore its generalization across diverse
medical imaging modalities, including microscopic and magnetic resonance
imaging. Furthermore, our evaluations resulted in cumulative accuracy gains of
up to +23% over a single backbone trained on the same limited data, which
highlights its potential for real-world adoption.

Abstract: In recent years, video question answering based on multimodal large language
models (MLLM) has garnered considerable attention, due to the benefits from the
substantial advancements in LLMs. However, these models have a notable
deficiency in the domains of video temporal grounding and reasoning, posing
challenges to the development of effective real-world video understanding
systems. Inspired by how humans use video players to interact with the progress
bar for video comprehension, we introduce VTimeCoT, a simple yet effective
training-free framework, designed for high-performance video grounding and
reasoning. The proposed framework incorporates two novel visual tools of the
progress bar: a plug-and-play progress bar integration tool and a
high-efficiency highlighting tool. In addition, to address the limitations of
conventional text-based chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, we introduce a
visuotemporal CoT process that integrates cross-modality reasoning across both
video and text. Our approach demonstrates significant performance improvements
on both Qwen2VL-7B and GPT4o baselines in tasks of video temporal grounding and
reasoning-based question answering. Finally, we showcase that the proposed
framework achieves a compositional and interpretable reasoning process. Project

Motivation: 现有3DGS压缩方法缺乏学习先验，限制了率失真性能的进一步提升，需要利用学习图像先验来恢复压缩引起的质量退化。

Method: 在初始压缩高斯基础上，构建恢复网络建模图像空间中的压缩伪影，引入粗渲染残差作为边信息，通过恢复图像的监督来优化压缩高斯。

Result: 框架与现有高斯压缩方法兼容，在广泛实验中验证了有效性，实现了优越的率失真性能，渲染质量优于最先进的3DGS压缩方法，同时存储需求大幅降低。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合学习图像先验和边信息，成功提升了3D高斯泼溅压缩的率失真性能，为3DGS压缩提供了高效且兼容性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Compression techniques for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have recently
achieved considerable success in minimizing storage overhead for 3D Gaussians
while preserving high rendering quality. Despite the impressive storage
reduction, the lack of learned priors restricts further advances in the
rate-distortion trade-off for 3DGS compression tasks. To address this, we
introduce a novel 3DGS compression framework that leverages the powerful
representational capacity of learned image priors to recover
compression-induced quality degradation. Built upon initially compressed
Gaussians, our restoration network effectively models the compression artifacts
in the image space between degraded and original Gaussians. To enhance the
rate-distortion performance, we provide coarse rendering residuals into the
restoration network as side information. By leveraging the supervision of
restored images, the compressed Gaussians are refined, resulting in a highly
compact representation with enhanced rendering performance. Our framework is
designed to be compatible with existing Gaussian compression methods, making it
broadly applicable across different baselines. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating superior rate-distortion
performance and outperforming the rendering quality of state-of-the-art 3DGS
compression methods while requiring substantially less storage.

Abstract: Effective monitoring of whale populations is critical for conservation, but
traditional survey methods are expensive and difficult to scale. While prior
work has shown that whales can be identified in very high-resolution (VHR)
satellite imagery, large-scale automated detection remains challenging due to a
lack of annotated imagery, variability in image quality and environmental
conditions, and the cost of building robust machine learning pipelines over
massive remote sensing archives. We present a semi-automated approach for
surfacing possible whale detections in VHR imagery using a statistical anomaly
detection method that flags spatial outliers, i.e. "interesting points". We
pair this detector with a web-based labeling interface designed to enable
experts to quickly annotate the interesting points. We evaluate our system on
three benchmark scenes with known whale annotations and achieve recalls of
90.3% to 96.4%, while reducing the area requiring expert inspection by up to
99.8% -- from over 1,000 sq km to less than 2 sq km in some cases. Our method
does not rely on labeled training data and offers a scalable first step toward
future machine-assisted marine mammal monitoring from space. We have open

Method: CFSAM包含三个组件：卷积局部特征提取器、基于Transformer的全局建模单元（捕获跨层交互）、特征融合机制（恢复和增强原始表示）

Result: 在SSD300框架中集成CFSAM，PASCAL VOC上mAP达78.6%（vs 75.5%基线），COCO上达52.1%（vs 43.1%基线），优于现有注意力模块，且加速训练收敛

Conclusion: 显式跨层注意力建模对推进多尺度目标检测至关重要

Abstract: Recent object detection methods have made remarkable progress by leveraging
attention mechanisms to improve feature discriminability. However, most
existing approaches are confined to refining single-layer or fusing dual-layer
features, overlooking the rich inter-layer dependencies across multi-scale
representations. This limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual
information essential for detecting objects with large scale variations. In
this paper, we propose a novel Cross-Layer Feature Self-Attention Module
(CFSAM), which holistically models both local and global dependencies within
multi-scale feature maps. CFSAM consists of three key components: a
convolutional local feature extractor, a Transformer-based global modeling unit
that efficiently captures cross-layer interactions, and a feature fusion
mechanism to restore and enhance the original representations. When integrated
into the SSD300 framework, CFSAM significantly boosts detection performance,
achieving 78.6% mAP on PASCAL VOC (vs. 75.5% baseline) and 52.1% mAP on COCO
(vs. 43.1% baseline), outperforming existing attention modules. Moreover, the
module accelerates convergence during training without introducing substantial
computational overhead. Our work highlights the importance of explicit
cross-layer attention modeling in advancing multi-scale object detection.

Motivation: 现实世界中的图像标注通常具有不同的粒度，受图像质量、标注者专业知识和任务需求的影响，而现有方法通常假设完整的细粒度标注，这与实际情况不符。

Result: 提出的方法和强基线在混合监督下显著提高了分层分类的性能。

Conclusion: ImageNet-F基准和提出的方法在现实世界约束下推进了分层分类的发展。

Abstract: Hierarchical image classification predicts labels across a semantic taxonomy,
but existing methods typically assume complete, fine-grained annotations, an
assumption rarely met in practice. Real-world supervision varies in
granularity, influenced by image quality, annotator expertise, and task
demands; a distant bird may be labeled Bird, while a close-up reveals Bald
eagle. We introduce ImageNet-F, a large-scale benchmark curated from ImageNet
and structured into cognitively inspired basic, subordinate, and fine-grained
levels. Using CLIP as a proxy for semantic ambiguity, we simulate realistic,
mixed-granularity labels reflecting human annotation behavior. We propose
free-grain learning, with heterogeneous supervision across instances. We
develop methods that enhance semantic guidance via pseudo-attributes from
vision-language models and visual guidance via semi-supervised learning. These,
along with strong baselines, substantially improve performance under mixed
supervision. Together, our benchmark and methods advance hierarchical
classification under real-world constraints.

Abstract: Understanding and explaining the behavior of machine learning models is
essential for building transparent and trustworthy AI systems. We introduce
DEXTER, a data-free framework that employs diffusion models and large language
models to generate global, textual explanations of visual classifiers. DEXTER
operates by optimizing text prompts to synthesize class-conditional images that
strongly activate a target classifier. These synthetic samples are then used to
elicit detailed natural language reports that describe class-specific decision
patterns and biases. Unlike prior work, DEXTER enables natural language
explanation about a classifier's decision process without access to training
data or ground-truth labels. We demonstrate DEXTER's flexibility across three
tasks-activation maximization, slice discovery and debiasing, and bias
explanation-each illustrating its ability to uncover the internal mechanisms of
visual classifiers. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including a user
study, show that DEXTER produces accurate, interpretable outputs. Experiments
on ImageNet, Waterbirds, CelebA, and FairFaces confirm that DEXTER outperforms
existing approaches in global model explanation and class-level bias reporting.

*Xu Wu,Zhihui Lai,Xianxu Hou,Jie Zhou,Ya-nan Zhang,Linlin Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了LightQANet框架，通过量化自适应特征学习解决低光图像增强问题，包含光照量化模块和光照感知提示模块，在多个数据集上取得SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在低光条件下难以提取可靠特征表示，导致纹理恢复差、颜色不一致和伪影问题

Method: 设计了光照量化模块(LQM)显式提取和量化光照相关因素，以及光照感知提示模块(LAPM)将光照先验编码为可学习提示来动态引导特征学习

Result: 在多个低光数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的性能，在各种挑战性光照场景下提供优越的定性和定量结果

Conclusion: LightQANet通过量化自适应特征学习能够实现跨不同光照条件的一致且鲁棒的图像质量

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve illumination while
preserving high-quality color and texture. However, existing methods often fail
to extract reliable feature representations due to severely degraded
pixel-level information under low-light conditions, resulting in poor texture
restoration, color inconsistency, and artifact. To address these challenges, we
propose LightQANet, a novel framework that introduces quantized and adaptive
feature learning for low-light enhancement, aiming to achieve consistent and
robust image quality across diverse lighting conditions. From the static
modeling perspective, we design a Light Quantization Module (LQM) to explicitly
extract and quantify illumination-related factors from image features. By
enforcing structured light factor learning, LQM enhances the extraction of
light-invariant representations and mitigates feature inconsistency across
varying illumination levels. From the dynamic adaptation perspective, we
introduce a Light-Aware Prompt Module (LAPM), which encodes illumination priors
into learnable prompts to dynamically guide the feature learning process. LAPM
enables the model to flexibly adapt to complex and continuously changing
lighting conditions, further improving image enhancement. Extensive experiments
on multiple low-light datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior qualitative and quantitative
results across various challenging lighting scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无线电通信在MAV群中面临频谱拥塞、干扰和高功耗问题，需要寻找更可靠的替代方案。

Result: 实验验证了框架的有效性，实现了准确解码和低功耗，在受限环境中表现出良好性能。

Conclusion: 该视觉通信框架为MAV群提供了一种节能高效的通信替代方案，特别适用于受限环境。

Abstract: Reliable communication in Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) swarms is challenging in
environments, where conventional radio-based methods suffer from spectrum
congestion, jamming, and high power consumption. Inspired by the waggle dance
of honeybees, which efficiently communicate the location of food sources
without sound or contact, we propose a novel visual communication framework for
MAV swarms using motion-based signaling. In this framework, MAVs convey
information, such as heading and distance, through deliberate flight patterns,
which are passively captured by event cameras and interpreted using a
predefined visual codebook of four motion primitives: vertical (up/down),
horizontal (left/right), left-to-up-to-right, and left-to-down-to-right,
representing control symbols (``start'', ``end'', ``1'', ``0''). To decode
these signals, we design an event frame-based segmentation model and a
lightweight Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for action recognition. An integrated
decoding algorithm then combines segmentation and classification to robustly
interpret MAV motion sequences. Experimental results validate the framework's
effectiveness, which demonstrates accurate decoding and low power consumption,
and highlights its potential as an energy-efficient alternative for MAV
communication in constrained environments.

*Hojun Choi,Youngsun Lim,Jaeyo Shin,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoT-PL框架通过视觉链式思维推理改进开放词汇目标检测，在拥挤和遮挡场景中显著提升伪标签质量，在COCO和LVIS数据集上达到新的SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放词汇目标检测方法依赖直接的图像-文本匹配，忽略了语义复杂场景中的中间推理步骤，导致在拥挤或遮挡场景中鲁棒性不足。

Method: 提出CoT-PL框架，将目标理解分解为三个可解释步骤：区域感知、零样本分类和背景定位，并引入对比背景学习来促进目标与背景的特征解耦。

Result: 在拥挤和遮挡场景中，新类伪标签质量分别比最佳先前方法提升103.4%和168.4%；在COCO数据集上AP50提升7.7，在LVIS数据集上mask AP提升2.9。

Conclusion: CoT-PL通过结构化视觉链式思维推理和对比背景学习，显著提升了开放词汇目标检测在复杂场景中的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) seeks to recognize and localize object
categories beyond those seen during training. Recent approaches typically
leverage vision-language models (VLMs) to generate pseudo-labels using
image-text alignment, allowing detectors to generalize to unseen classes
without explicit supervision. However, these methods depend heavily on direct
image-text matching, neglecting the intermediate reasoning steps essential for
interpreting semantically complex scenes. This results in limited robustness
when confronted with crowded or occluded visual contexts. In this paper, we
introduce CoT-PL, a new framework that employs structured visual
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning into the pseudo-labeling process. CoT-PL
decomposes object understanding into three interpretable steps: (1) region
perception even for unseen objects, (2) category recognition via zero-shot
reasoning, and (3) background grounding to separate semantically complex
objects. Crucially, the third step naturally motivates our contrastive
background learning (CBL) that uses the pre-computed background cues as
negatives to promote feature disentanglement between objects and background. In
this way, CoT reasoning and CBL form an integrated pipeline tailored to robust
pseudo-labeling in crowded or occluded scenes. Notably, in these two settings,
our novel-class pseudo-label quality achieves relative improvements of 103.4%
and 168.4% over the best prior, respectively. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that CoT-PL achieves +7.7 AP50 on open-vocabulary COCO and +2.9
mask AP on LVIS for novel classes, setting a new state of the art.

TL;DR: 开发了一个名为PRISM的可解释AI模型，用于结直肠癌预后预测，通过整合连续变异谱来表征表型多样性，在5年总生存期预测上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结直肠癌是全球第三大常见恶性肿瘤，现有基础模型往往忽视器官特异性关键形态模式，这些模式代表不同的生物过程，能从根本上影响肿瘤行为、治疗反应和患者预后。

Method: PRISM模型整合了每个独特形态内的连续变异谱来表征表型多样性，反映恶性转化通过渐进进化过程而非突然表型转变的原理。模型在424名III期结直肠癌患者的874万张组织学图像上进行训练。

Result: PRISM在5年总生存期预测上表现出优越性能（AUC = 0.70±0.04；准确率=68.37%±4.75%；HR = 3.34），比现有结直肠癌特异性方法高15%，比AI基础模型高约23%准确率。模型具有性别无关的鲁棒性和跨临床病理亚组的稳定性能。

Conclusion: PRISM是一个新颖、可解释的AI模型，能够有效捕捉结直肠癌的形态多样性，在预后预测方面优于现有方法，为精准医疗提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third most prevalent malignancy globally,
with approximately 154,000 new cases and 54,000 projected deaths anticipated
for 2025. The recent advancement of foundation models in computational
pathology has been largely propelled by task agnostic methodologies that can
overlook organ-specific crucial morphological patterns that represent distinct
biological processes that can fundamentally influence tumor behavior,
therapeutic response, and patient outcomes. The aim of this study is to develop
a novel, interpretable AI model, PRISM (Prognostic Representation of Integrated
Spatial Morphology), that incorporates a continuous variability spectrum within
each distinct morphology to characterize phenotypic diversity and reflecting
the principle that malignant transformation occurs through incremental
evolutionary processes rather than abrupt phenotypic shifts. PRISM is trained
on 8.74 million histological images extracted from surgical resection specimens
of 424 patients with stage III CRC. PRISM achieved superior prognostic
performance for five-year OS (AUC = 0.70 +- 0.04; accuracy = 68.37% +- 4.75%;
HR = 3.34, 95% CI = 2.28-4.90; p < 0.0001), outperforming existing CRC-specific
methods by 15% and AI foundation models by ~23% accuracy. It showed
sex-agnostic robustness (AUC delta = 0.02; accuracy delta = 0.15%) and stable
performance across clinicopathological subgroups, with minimal accuracy
fluctuation (delta = 1.44%) between 5FU/LV and CPT-11/5FU/LV regimens,
replicating the Alliance cohort finding of no survival difference between
treatments.

TL;DR: R-Super是一种利用医学报告训练AI进行肿瘤分割的方法，无需大量手动标注的肿瘤掩膜，显著降低了AI训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期肿瘤检测至关重要，但CT扫描中的小肿瘤检测困难，且训练AI模型需要大量手动绘制的肿瘤掩膜，成本高昂。医学报告中丰富的肿瘤描述信息未被充分利用。

Method: R-Super通过训练AI模型使其能够根据医学报告中的肿瘤描述来分割肿瘤，利用大量现成的医学报告进行训练。

Result: 使用101,654份报告训练的AI模型性能与使用723个掩膜训练的模型相当。结合报告和掩膜训练，灵敏度提高13%，特异性提高8%，在7种肿瘤类型中有5种检测效果超过放射科医生。

Conclusion: R-Super挑战了大规模手动肿瘤掩膜创建的必要性，为多种肿瘤类型的早期检测提供了可扩展且易于获取的途径。

Abstract: Early tumor detection save lives. Each year, more than 300 million computed
tomography (CT) scans are performed worldwide, offering a vast opportunity for
effective cancer screening. However, detecting small or early-stage tumors on
these CT scans remains challenging, even for experts. Artificial intelligence
(AI) models can assist by highlighting suspicious regions, but training such
models typically requires extensive tumor masks--detailed, voxel-wise outlines
of tumors manually drawn by radiologists. Drawing these masks is costly,
requiring years of effort and millions of dollars. In contrast, nearly every CT
scan in clinical practice is already accompanied by medical reports describing
the tumor's size, number, appearance, and sometimes, pathology
results--information that is rich, abundant, and often underutilized for AI
training. We introduce R-Super, which trains AI to segment tumors that match
their descriptions in medical reports. This approach scales AI training with
large collections of readily available medical reports, substantially reducing
the need for manually drawn tumor masks. When trained on 101,654 reports, AI
models achieved performance comparable to those trained on 723 masks. Combining
reports and masks further improved sensitivity by +13% and specificity by +8%,
surpassing radiologists in detecting five of the seven tumor types. Notably,
R-Super enabled segmentation of tumors in the spleen, gallbladder, prostate,
bladder, uterus, and esophagus, for which no public masks or AI models
previously existed. This study challenges the long-held belief that
large-scale, labor-intensive tumor mask creation is indispensable, establishing
a scalable and accessible path toward early detection across diverse tumor
types.

TL;DR: PRTraj是一个新的轨迹表示学习框架，通过整合环境感知和路径选择建模来改进轨迹嵌入表示，在多个下游任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹表示学习方法将轨迹视为孤立的时空序列，忽略了影响轨迹形成的外部环境和内部路径选择行为。

Method: PRTraj包含环境感知模块（从POI分布捕捉多粒度环境语义）和路径选择编码器（将道路段转换建模为决策序列），最终聚合形成全局轨迹嵌入。

Result: 在3个真实数据集和5个下游任务上的实验验证了PRTraj的有效性和泛化能力，且在少样本场景下仍保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: PRTraj通过统一环境感知和路径选择建模，显著提升了轨迹表示学习的性能，具有强大的数据效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: Trajectory Representation Learning (TRL) aims to encode raw trajectories into
low-dimensional vectors, which can then be leveraged in various downstream
tasks, including travel time estimation, location prediction, and trajectory
similarity analysis. However, existing TRL methods suffer from a key oversight:
treating trajectories as isolated spatio-temporal sequences, without
considering the external environment and internal route choice behavior that
govern their formation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that
unifies comprehensive environment \textbf{P}erception and explicit
\textbf{R}oute choice modeling for effective \textbf{Traj}ectory representation
learning, dubbed \textbf{PRTraj}. Specifically, PRTraj first introduces an
Environment Perception Module to enhance the road network by capturing
multi-granularity environmental semantics from surrounding POI distributions.
Building on this environment-aware backbone, a Route Choice Encoder then
captures the route choice behavior inherent in each trajectory by modeling its
constituent road segment transitions as a sequence of decisions. These
route-choice-aware representations are finally aggregated to form the global
trajectory embedding. Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets across 5
downstream tasks validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PRTraj.
Moreover, PRTraj demonstrates strong data efficiency, maintaining robust
performance under few-shot scenarios. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大容量生成模型无法在智能手机上部署的问题，因为手机内存和计算资源有限。虽然量化方法可以降低模型参数精度实现高效计算，但激进量化会损害模型质量。

Method: 提出分数位量化方法SHORT，渐进式降低模型精度（从32位到4位），在优化过程中利用分数位来维持高质量生成。

Result: 在多种扩散模型上（包括SD3.5-Medium、Sana、Pixart和FLUX.1-schnell）实现了改进的质量，比标准QAT的FiD低4-7%。成功在三星S25U手机上部署运行Sana模型。

Conclusion: SHORT方法有效解决了生成模型在资源受限设备上的部署问题，在保持高质量的同时实现了高效计算。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in image synthesis or text generation, often with a large capacity
model. However, these large models cannot be deployed on smartphones due to the
limited availability of on-board memory and computations. Quantization methods
lower the precision of the model parameters, allowing for efficient
computations, \eg, in \INT{8}. Although aggressive quantization addresses
efficiency and memory constraints, preserving the quality of the model remains
a challenge. To retain quality in previous aggressive quantization, we propose
a new fractional bits quantization (\short) approach. The novelty is a simple
yet effective idea: we progressively reduce the model's precision from 32 to 4
bits per parameter, and exploit the fractional bits during optimization to
maintain high generation quality. We show that the \short{} yields improved
quality on a variety of diffusion models, including SD3.5-Medium, Sana,
\pixart, and FLUX.1-schnell, while achieving $4-7\%$ lower FiD than standard
QAT. Finally, we deploy and run Sana on a Samsung S25U, which runs on the
Qualcomm SM8750-AB Snapdragon 8 Elite Hexagon Tensor Processor (HTP).

TL;DR: AI肿瘤分割受限于缺乏大规模体素级标注数据集。研究发现合成数据可以显著提升数据缩放效率，仅用500个真实扫描就能达到1500个扫描的性能。基于此创建了AbdomenAtlas 2.0数据集，包含10,135个CT扫描和15,130个肿瘤实例，在六个器官上实现了比公开数据集更好的分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI肿瘤分割面临的大规模体素级标注数据稀缺问题，这些数据难以创建且需要医学专家参与。

Method: 基于JHH数据集的经验教训，创建了AbdomenAtlas 2.0数据集，包含10,135个CT扫描，由23名放射科专家在六个器官（胰腺、肝脏、肾脏、结肠、食管、子宫）上进行体素级手动标注，共15,130个肿瘤实例和5,893个对照扫描。

Result: AbdomenAtlas 2.0在分布内测试中DSC指标提升7%，在分布外测试中提升16%，显著优于现有公开数据集。

Conclusion: 合成数据可以显著提升数据缩放效率，AbdomenAtlas 2.0为训练六器官肿瘤分割AI提供了强大基础，展示了大规模标注数据集在提升AI性能方面的重要价值。

Abstract: AI for tumor segmentation is limited by the lack of large, voxel-wise
annotated datasets, which are hard to create and require medical experts. In
our proprietary JHH dataset of 3,000 annotated pancreatic tumor scans, we found
that AI performance stopped improving after 1,500 scans. With synthetic data,
we reached the same performance using only 500 real scans. This finding
suggests that synthetic data can steepen data scaling laws, enabling more
efficient model training than real data alone. Motivated by these lessons, we
created AbdomenAtlas 2.0--a dataset of 10,135 CT scans with a total of 15,130
tumor instances per-voxel manually annotated in six organs (pancreas, liver,
kidney, colon, esophagus, and uterus) and 5,893 control scans. Annotated by 23
expert radiologists, it is several orders of magnitude larger than existing
public tumor datasets. While we continue expanding the dataset, the current
version of AbdomenAtlas 2.0 already provides a strong foundation--based on
lessons from the JHH dataset--for training AI to segment tumors in six organs.
It achieves notable improvements over public datasets, with a +7% DSC gain on
in-distribution tests and +16% on out-of-distribution tests.

Abstract: Spatial perception and reasoning are crucial for Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models to accomplish fine-grained manipulation tasks. However, existing
approaches often lack the ability to understand and reason over the essential
3D structures necessary for precise control. To address this limitation, we
propose QDepth-VLA, a general framework that augments VLA models with an
auxiliary depth prediction task. A dedicated depth expert is designed to
predict quantized latent tokens of depth maps obtained from a VQ-VAE encoder,
enabling the model to learn depth-aware representations that capture critical
geometric cues. Experimental results on the simulation benchmarks and
real-world tasks demonstrate that QDepth-VLA yields strong spatial reasoning
and competitive performance on manipulation tasks.

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型在现实场景中表现良好，但在想象力场景中性能显著下降，因为这些场景涉及罕见共现概念和长距离语义关系，超出了训练分布范围。

Method: ImagerySearch是一种提示引导的自适应测试时搜索策略，根据提示中的语义关系动态调整推理搜索空间和奖励函数。

Abstract: Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress, particularly
excelling in realistic scenarios; however, their performance degrades notably
in imaginative scenarios. These prompts often involve rarely co-occurring
concepts with long-distance semantic relationships, falling outside training
distributions. Existing methods typically apply test-time scaling for improving
video quality, but their fixed search spaces and static reward designs limit
adaptability to imaginative scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose
ImagerySearch, a prompt-guided adaptive test-time search strategy that
dynamically adjusts both the inference search space and reward function
according to semantic relationships in the prompt. This enables more coherent
and visually plausible videos in challenging imaginative settings. To evaluate
progress in this direction, we introduce LDT-Bench, the first dedicated
benchmark for long-distance semantic prompts, consisting of 2,839 diverse
concept pairs and an automated protocol for assessing creative generation
capabilities. Extensive experiments show that ImagerySearch consistently
outperforms strong video generation baselines and existing test-time scaling
approaches on LDT-Bench, and achieves competitive improvements on VBench,
demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse prompt types. We will release
LDT-Bench and code to facilitate future research on imaginative video
generation.

Abstract: Early detection of melanoma has grown to be essential because it
significantly improves survival rates, but automated analysis of skin lesions
still remains challenging. ABCDE, which stands for Asymmetry, Border
irregularity, Color variation, Diameter, and Evolving, is a well-known
classification method for skin lesions, but most deep learning mechanisms treat
it as a black box, as most of the human interpretable features are not
explained. In this work, we propose a deep learning framework that both
classifies skin lesions into categories and also quantifies scores for each
ABCD feature. It simulates the evolution of these features over time in order
to represent the E aspect, opening more windows for future exploration. The A,
B, C, and D values are quantified particularly within this work. Moreover, this
framework also visualizes ABCD feature trajectories in latent space as skin
lesions evolve from benign nevuses to malignant melanoma. The experiments are
conducted using the HAM10000 dataset that contains around ten thousand images
of skin lesions of varying stages. In summary, the classification worked with
an accuracy of around 89 percent, with melanoma AUC being 0.96, while the
feature evaluation performed well in predicting asymmetry, color variation, and
diameter, though border irregularity remains more difficult to model. Overall,
this work provides a deep learning framework that will allow doctors to link ML
diagnoses to clinically relevant criteria, thus improving our understanding of
skin cancer progression.

Abstract: The real-world is inherently multi-modal at its core. Our tools observe and
take snapshots of it, in digital form, such as videos or sounds, however much
of it is lost. Similarly for actions and information passing between humans,
languages are used as a written form of communication. Traditionally, Machine
Learning models have been unimodal (i.e. rgb -> semantic or text ->
sentiment_class). Recent trends go towards bi-modality, where images and text
are learned together, however, in order to truly understand the world, we need
to integrate all these independent modalities. In this work we try to combine
as many visual modalities as we can using little to no human supervision. In
order to do this, we use pre-trained experts and procedural combinations
between them on top of raw videos using a fully autonomous data-pipeline, which
we also open-source. We then make use of PHG-MAE, a model specifically designed
to leverage multi-modal data. We show that this model which was efficiently
distilled into a low-parameter (<1M) can have competitive results compared to
models of ~300M parameters. We deploy this model and analyze the use-case of
real-time semantic segmentation from handheld devices or webcams on commodity
hardware. Finally, we deploy other off-the-shelf models using the same
framework, such as DPT for near real-time depth estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在各种视觉语言任务中表现出色，但其在面部识别方面的潜力尚未得到充分探索，特别是开源MLLMs需要在标准基准上与现有面部识别模型进行比较评估。

Method: 在多个面部识别数据集（LFW、CALFW、CPLFW、CFP、AgeDB和RFW）上对最先进的MLLMs进行系统基准测试。

Result: 实验结果表明，MLLMs能够捕捉丰富的语义线索，但在零样本应用的高精度识别场景中表现不如专用面部识别模型。

Conclusion: 该基准为推进基于MLLM的面部识别提供了基础，为设计具有更高准确性和泛化能力的下一代模型提供了见解。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance
across diverse vision-and-language tasks. However, their potential in face
recognition remains underexplored. In particular, the performance of
open-source MLLMs needs to be evaluated and compared with existing face
recognition models on standard benchmarks with similar protocol. In this work,
we present a systematic benchmark of state-of-the-art MLLMs for face
recognition on several face recognition datasets, including LFW, CALFW, CPLFW,
CFP, AgeDB and RFW. Experimental results reveal that while MLLMs capture rich
semantic cues useful for face-related tasks, they lag behind specialized models
in high-precision recognition scenarios in zero-shot applications. This
benchmark provides a foundation for advancing MLLM-based face recognition,
offering insights for the design of next-generation models with higher accuracy
and generalization. The source code of our benchmark is publicly available in

*Guangyi Han,Wei Zhai,Yuhang Yang,Yang Cao,Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Free-Form HOI Generation方法，通过细粒度意图控制生成多样化的手-物体交互，超越了传统固定抓握模式，支持推、戳、旋转等自由交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HOI生成研究局限于固定抓握模式，基于物理先验或通用意图指令，无法捕捉日常交互的多样性。

Method: 构建WildO2数据集，提出TOUCH三阶段框架，基于多级扩散模型，利用显式接触建模进行条件控制，并通过接触一致性和物理约束进行细化。

Result: 能够生成可控、多样且物理合理的手部交互，代表日常活动中的各种交互模式。

Conclusion: 该方法成功扩展了HOI从抓握到自由形式交互的范围，为细粒度语义控制的手部姿势生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Hand-object interaction (HOI) is fundamental for humans to express intent.
Existing HOI generation research is predominantly confined to fixed grasping
patterns, where control is tied to physical priors such as force closure or
generic intent instructions, even when expressed through elaborate language.
Such an overly general conditioning imposes a strong inductive bias for stable
grasps, thus failing to capture the diversity of daily HOI. To address these
limitations, we introduce Free-Form HOI Generation, which aims to generate
controllable, diverse, and physically plausible HOI conditioned on fine-grained
intent, extending HOI from grasping to free-form interactions, like pushing,
poking, and rotating. To support this task, we construct WildO2, an in-the-wild
diverse 3D HOI dataset, which includes diverse HOI derived from internet
videos. Specifically, it contains 4.4k unique interactions across 92 intents
and 610 object categories, each with detailed semantic annotations. Building on
this dataset, we propose TOUCH, a three-stage framework centered on a
multi-level diffusion model that facilitates fine-grained semantic control to
generate versatile hand poses beyond grasping priors. This process leverages
explicit contact modeling for conditioning and is subsequently refined with
contact consistency and physical constraints to ensure realism. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate our method's ability to generate controllable, diverse,
and physically plausible hand interactions representative of daily activities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有碰撞预测方法无法区分自车威胁和与自车无关的随机事故，导致实际部署中产生过多误报

Method: 使用V-JEPA2骨干网络端到端训练，提供BADAS-Open（1.5k公开视频）和BADAS1.0（40k专有视频）两个变体，重新标注基准数据集以识别自车参与情况

Result: 在DAD、DADA-2000、DoTA和Nexar数据集上，BADAS实现了最先进的AP/AUC性能，优于前向碰撞ADAS基线，并提供更真实的事故时间估计

Conclusion: BADAS通过专注于自车威胁的碰撞预测，显著减少了误报，并发布了模型权重、代码和重新标注的数据集以促进相关研究

Abstract: Existing collision prediction methods often fail to distinguish between
ego-vehicle threats and random accidents not involving the ego vehicle, leading
to excessive false alerts in real-world deployment. We present BADAS, a family
of collision prediction models trained on Nexar's real-world dashcam collision
dataset -- the first benchmark designed explicitly for ego-centric evaluation.
We re-annotate major benchmarks to identify ego involvement, add consensus
alert-time labels, and synthesize negatives where needed, enabling fair AP/AUC
and temporal evaluation. BADAS uses a V-JEPA2 backbone trained end-to-end and
comes in two variants: BADAS-Open (trained on our 1.5k public videos) and
BADAS1.0 (trained on 40k proprietary videos). Across DAD, DADA-2000, DoTA, and
Nexar, BADAS achieves state-of-the-art AP/AUC and outperforms a
forward-collision ADAS baseline while producing more realistic time-to-accident
estimates. We release our BADAS-Open model weights and code, along with
re-annotations of all evaluation datasets to promote ego-centric collision
prediction research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然扩散模型已经探索了控制机制，但在视觉自回归范式下实现精确灵活的控制仍然研究不足。

Method: 提出ScaleWeaver框架，核心是改进的MMDiT块和参考注意力模块，该模块丢弃了图像→条件的非必要注意力，降低计算成本同时稳定控制注入，并强调参数重用和零初始化线性投影。

Result: 大量实验表明ScaleWeaver能够提供高质量生成和精确控制，在效率上优于基于扩散的方法。

Conclusion: ScaleWeaver是视觉自回归范式下可控文本到图像生成的实用有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation with visual autoregressive~(VAR) models has recently
achieved impressive advances in generation fidelity and inference efficiency.
While control mechanisms have been explored for diffusion models, enabling
precise and flexible control within VAR paradigm remains underexplored. To
bridge this critical gap, in this paper, we introduce ScaleWeaver, a novel
framework designed to achieve high-fidelity, controllable generation upon
advanced VAR models through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The core module in
ScaleWeaver is the improved MMDiT block with the proposed Reference Attention
module, which efficiently and effectively incorporates conditional information.
Different from MM Attention, the proposed Reference Attention module discards
the unnecessary attention from image$\rightarrow$condition, reducing
computational cost while stabilizing control injection. Besides, it
strategically emphasizes parameter reuse, leveraging the capability of the VAR
backbone itself with a few introduced parameters to process control
information, and equipping a zero-initialized linear projection to ensure that
control signals are incorporated effectively without disrupting the generative
capability of the base model. Extensive experiments show that ScaleWeaver
delivers high-quality generation and precise control while attaining superior
efficiency over diffusion-based methods, making ScaleWeaver a practical and
effective solution for controllable text-to-image generation within the visual
autoregressive paradigm. Code and models will be released.

TL;DR: 提出nlg2choice方法解决多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉分类中处理自由形式响应和大量选项的评估难题，通过两阶段方法提升分类和检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注纯语言任务或不超过5个选项的多选题，无法有效处理细粒度视觉分类中数百到数千个高度相关选项的情况，且难以扩展到基于检索的问题。

Method: nlg2choice两阶段方法：首先向MLLM提出开放式问题，然后使用纯文本约束解码预测最可能的选项；在检索设置中采用早停方法计算约束响应的概率以提高吞吐量。

Result: 在七个细粒度视觉数据集上的实验表明，该方法在分类和检索方面均优于现有方法，且在不同自然语言任务实现方式下性能稳定。

Conclusion: nlg2choice方法有效解决了MLLM在细粒度视觉分类中处理大量选项和自由形式响应的评估挑战，显著提升了性能并保持了良好的通用性。

Abstract: Despite the renewed interest in zero-shot visual classification due to the
rise of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the problem of evaluating
free-form responses of auto-regressive models remains a persistent challenge.
Most existing works focus on language-only tasks or don't consider Multiple
Choice Questions (MCQs) beyond 5-way options, both of which are critical
capabilities to solve tasks in Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) where
choice counts are in the hundreds to thousands and the choices are highly
related. Furthermore, in this highly multi-way MCQ setting it is not clear how
to extend LLM choice extraction to retrieval-based problems, where computing
probabilities over the choice set is computationally costly. In this work we
investigate nlg2choice, a simple two-stage method which first asks the MLLM an
open-ended question for the task with minimal constraints, then uses text-only
constrained decoding to predict the most likely choice. In retrieval settings,
we compute the probability of the constrained response taking that choice with
an early stopping method to significantly improve throughput. Our results show
improvement over a suite of seven fine-grained visual datasets when evaluating
in terms of classification and retrieval, and show that this performance holds
over the various ways that users of LLMs can implement tasks in natural
language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督视频异常检测方法难以检测复杂的对象交互异常且缺乏可解释性

Method: 使用MLLM分析不同时刻的对象对视觉输入，生成活动与交互的文本描述，通过比较训练和测试视频的文本描述来检测异常

Result: 在基准数据集上有效检测复杂交互异常，并在无交互异常的数据集上达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能有效检测复杂异常，还提供可解释性，可与传统方法结合进一步提升性能

Abstract: Existing semi-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) methods often struggle
with detecting complex anomalies involving object interactions and generally
lack explainability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel VAD
framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Unlike previous
MLLM-based approaches that make direct anomaly judgments at the frame level,
our method focuses on extracting and interpreting object activity and
interactions over time. By querying an MLLM with visual inputs of object pairs
at different moments, we generate textual descriptions of the activity and
interactions from nominal videos. These textual descriptions serve as a
high-level representation of the activity and interactions of objects in a
video. They are used to detect anomalies during test time by comparing them to
textual descriptions found in nominal training videos. Our approach inherently
provides explainability and can be combined with many traditional VAD methods
to further enhance their interpretability. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method not only detects complex interaction-based
anomalies effectively but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on
datasets without interaction anomalies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于密集视频对象字幕任务的复杂性和手动标注的高成本，现有方法采用分离训练策略导致性能不佳，需要开发端到端的解决方案。

Method: 利用先进视觉语言模型生成时空定位实体的合成字幕，扩展LVIS和LV-VIS数据集为LVISCap和LV-VISCap，训练MaskCaptioner端到端模型。

Result: 在LVISCap和LV-VISCap上预训练后，MaskCaptioner在VidSTG、VLN和BenSMOT三个基准测试中取得了最先进的DVOC结果。

Conclusion: 通过合成字幕扩展数据集和端到端训练策略，MaskCaptioner有效解决了密集视频对象字幕任务，提供了高质量的联合检测、跟踪和字幕生成能力。

Abstract: Dense Video Object Captioning (DVOC) is the task of jointly detecting,
tracking, and captioning object trajectories in a video, requiring the ability
to understand spatio-temporal details and describe them in natural language.
Due to the complexity of the task and the high cost associated with manual
annotation, previous approaches resort to disjoint training strategies,
potentially leading to suboptimal performance. To circumvent this issue, we
propose to generate captions about spatio-temporally localized entities
leveraging a state-of-the-art VLM. By extending the LVIS and LV-VIS datasets
with our synthetic captions (LVISCap and LV-VISCap), we train MaskCaptioner, an
end-to-end model capable of jointly detecting, segmenting, tracking and
captioning object trajectories. Moreover, with pretraining on LVISCap and
LV-VISCap, MaskCaptioner achieves state-of-the-art DVOC results on three
existing benchmarks, VidSTG, VLN and BenSMOT. The datasets and code are

TL;DR: 3DScenePrompt是一个视频生成框架，通过双时空条件机制和3D场景记忆实现长视频生成，支持精确相机控制和场景一致性保持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常基于单张图像或短视频进行条件生成，难以在生成长视频时保持场景一致性和精确相机控制。需要解决超越时间边界时动态元素错误保留的问题。

Method: 采用双时空条件机制：时间相邻帧用于运动连续性，空间相邻内容用于场景一致性。引入3D场景记忆表示静态几何，通过动态SLAM和动态掩码策略分离静态场景几何和动态元素。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在场景一致性、相机可控性和生成质量方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 3DScenePrompt框架能够有效保持长距离空间连贯性和精确相机控制，同时不牺牲计算效率或运动真实性。

Abstract: We present 3DScenePrompt, a framework that generates the next video chunk
from arbitrary-length input while enabling precise camera control and
preserving scene consistency. Unlike methods conditioned on a single image or a
short clip, we employ dual spatio-temporal conditioning that reformulates
context-view referencing across the input video. Our approach conditions on
both temporally adjacent frames for motion continuity and spatially adjacent
content for scene consistency. However, when generating beyond temporal
boundaries, directly using spatially adjacent frames would incorrectly preserve
dynamic elements from the past. We address this by introducing a 3D scene
memory that represents exclusively the static geometry extracted from the
entire input video. To construct this memory, we leverage dynamic SLAM with our
newly introduced dynamic masking strategy that explicitly separates static
scene geometry from moving elements. The static scene representation can then
be projected to any target viewpoint, providing geometrically consistent warped
views that serve as strong 3D spatial prompts while allowing dynamic regions to
evolve naturally from temporal context. This enables our model to maintain
long-range spatial coherence and precise camera control without sacrificing
computational efficiency or motion realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in scene
consistency, camera controllability, and generation quality. Project page :

Abstract: Whole-body multi-modal human motion generation poses two primary challenges:
creating an effective motion generation mechanism and integrating various
modalities, such as text, speech, and music, into a cohesive framework. Unlike
previous methods that usually employ discrete masked modeling or autoregressive
modeling, we develop a continuous masked autoregressive motion transformer,
where a causal attention is performed considering the sequential nature within
the human motion. Within this transformer, we introduce a gated linear
attention and an RMSNorm module, which drive the transformer to pay attention
to the key actions and suppress the instability caused by either the abnormal
movements or the heterogeneous distributions within multi-modalities. To
further enhance both the motion generation and the multimodal generalization,
we employ the DiT structure to diffuse the conditions from the transformer
towards the targets. To fuse different modalities, AdaLN and cross-attention
are leveraged to inject the text, speech, and music signals. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework outperforms previous methods across all
modalities, including text-to-motion, speech-to-gesture, and music-to-dance.
The code of our method will be made public.

Conclusion: RealDPO通过利用真实世界数据进行偏好学习，有效解决了视频生成中复杂运动合成的挑战，为提升运动真实感提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Video generative models have recently achieved notable advancements in
synthesis quality. However, generating complex motions remains a critical
challenge, as existing models often struggle to produce natural, smooth, and
contextually consistent movements. This gap between generated and real-world
motions limits their practical applicability. To address this issue, we
introduce RealDPO, a novel alignment paradigm that leverages real-world data as
positive samples for preference learning, enabling more accurate motion
synthesis. Unlike traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which offers
limited corrective feedback, RealDPO employs Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) with a tailored loss function to enhance motion realism. By contrasting
real-world videos with erroneous model outputs, RealDPO enables iterative
self-correction, progressively refining motion quality. To support
post-training in complex motion synthesis, we propose RealAction-5K, a curated
dataset of high-quality videos capturing human daily activities with rich and
precise motion details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RealDPO
significantly improves video quality, text alignment, and motion realism
compared to state-of-the-art models and existing preference optimization
techniques.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in textual reasoning, they
struggle with mathematical domains like geometry that intrinsically rely on
visual aids. Existing approaches to Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) are often
limited by rigid external tools or fail to generate the high-fidelity,
strategically-timed diagrams necessary for complex problem-solving. To bridge
this gap, we introduce MathCanvas, a comprehensive framework designed to endow
unified Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with intrinsic VCoT capabilities for
mathematics. Our approach consists of two phases. First, a Visual Manipulation
stage pre-trains the model on a novel 15.2M-pair corpus, comprising 10M
caption-to-diagram pairs (MathCanvas-Imagen) and 5.2M step-by-step editing
trajectories (MathCanvas-Edit), to master diagram generation and editing.
Second, a Strategic Visual-Aided Reasoning stage fine-tunes the model on
MathCanvas-Instruct, a new 219K-example dataset of interleaved visual-textual
reasoning paths, teaching it when and how to leverage visual aids. To
facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce MathCanvas-Bench, a challenging
benchmark with 3K problems that require models to produce interleaved
visual-textual solutions. Our model, BAGEL-Canvas, trained under this
framework, achieves an 86% relative improvement over strong LMM baselines on
MathCanvas-Bench, demonstrating excellent generalization to other public math
benchmarks. Our work provides a complete toolkit-framework, datasets, and
benchmark-to unlock complex, human-like visual-aided reasoning in LMMs. Project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于点图的3D重建方法在静态场景中表现良好，但直接应用于动态场景时，由于运动物体违反多视角几何约束，导致重建结果不准确。

Method: 除了预测点图外，C4D捕获短时光流和长时点跟踪两种对应关系，训练动态感知点跟踪器提供移动性信息，估计运动掩码分离运动元素和静态背景，并引入动态场景优化目标。

Result: 实验表明C4D实现了完整的4D恢复，在深度估计、相机姿态估计和点跟踪等多个下游任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: C4D通过引入时间对应关系，成功将3D重建扩展到4D动态场景，解决了动态物体对多视角几何约束的破坏问题。

Abstract: Recovering 4D from monocular video, which jointly estimates dynamic geometry
and camera poses, is an inevitably challenging problem. While recent
pointmap-based 3D reconstruction methods (e.g., DUSt3R) have made great
progress in reconstructing static scenes, directly applying them to dynamic
scenes leads to inaccurate results. This discrepancy arises because moving
objects violate multi-view geometric constraints, disrupting the
reconstruction. To address this, we introduce C4D, a framework that leverages
temporal Correspondences to extend existing 3D reconstruction formulation to
4D. Specifically, apart from predicting pointmaps, C4D captures two types of
correspondences: short-term optical flow and long-term point tracking. We train
a dynamic-aware point tracker that provides additional mobility information,
facilitating the estimation of motion masks to separate moving elements from
the static background, thus offering more reliable guidance for dynamic scenes.
Furthermore, we introduce a set of dynamic scene optimization objectives to
recover per-frame 3D geometry and camera parameters. Simultaneously, the
correspondences lift 2D trajectories into smooth 3D trajectories, enabling
fully integrated 4D reconstruction. Experiments show that our framework
achieves complete 4D recovery and demonstrates strong performance across
multiple downstream tasks, including depth estimation, camera pose estimation,
and point tracking. Project Page: https://littlepure2333.github.io/C4D

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功解决了现有扩散模型在降水临近预报中的可扩展性问题，通过集成注意力机制实现了更好的性能，无需复杂的潜在模块。

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, predicting future radar echo sequences from current
observations, is a critical yet challenging task due to the inherently chaotic
and tightly coupled spatio-temporal dynamics of the atmosphere. While recent
advances in diffusion-based models attempt to capture both large-scale motion
and fine-grained stochastic variability, they often suffer from scalability
issues: latent-space approaches require a separately trained autoencoder,
adding complexity and limiting generalization, while pixel-space approaches are
computationally intensive and often omit attention mechanisms, reducing their
ability to model long-range spatio-temporal dependencies. To address these
limitations, we propose a Token-wise Attention integrated into not only the
U-Net diffusion model but also the spatio-temporal encoder that dynamically
captures multi-scale spatial interactions and temporal evolution. Unlike prior
approaches, our method natively integrates attention into the architecture
without incurring the high resource cost typical of pixel-space diffusion,
thereby eliminating the need for separate latent modules. Our extensive
experiments and visual evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, yielding
superior local fidelity, generalization, and robustness in complex
precipitation forecasting scenarios.

Result: 在ChangingGrounding基准上评估，Mem-ChangingGrounder实现了最高的定位精度，同时大幅降低了探索成本。

Conclusion: 该基准和方法推动了面向实际应用的、以记忆为中心的3D视觉定位研究发展。

Abstract: Real-world robots localize objects from natural-language instructions while
scenes around them keep changing. Yet most of the existing 3D visual grounding
(3DVG) method still assumes a reconstructed and up-to-date point cloud, an
assumption that forces costly re-scans and hinders deployment. We argue that
3DVG should be formulated as an active, memory-driven problem, and we introduce
ChangingGrounding, the first benchmark that explicitly measures how well an
agent can exploit past observations, explore only where needed, and still
deliver precise 3D boxes in changing scenes. To set a strong reference point,
we also propose Mem-ChangingGrounder, a zero-shot method for this task that
marries cross-modal retrieval with lightweight multi-view fusion: it identifies
the object type implied by the query, retrieves relevant memories to guide
actions, then explores the target efficiently in the scene, falls back when
previous operations are invalid, performs multi-view scanning of the target,
and projects the fused evidence from multi-view scans to get accurate object
bounding boxes. We evaluate different baselines on ChangingGrounding, and our
Mem-ChangingGrounder achieves the highest localization accuracy while greatly
reducing exploration cost. We hope this benchmark and method catalyze a shift
toward practical, memory-centric 3DVG research for real-world applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了WithAnyone模型，通过构建MultiID-2M数据集和对比性身份损失函数，解决了文本到图像生成中的copy-paste问题，在保持身份一致性的同时实现多样化的可控生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于重建训练的身份一致性生成模型存在copy-paste问题，即直接复制参考面部而非在姿态、表情、光照等自然变化中保持身份，这限制了生成的可控性和表达能力。

Method: 构建大规模配对数据集MultiID-2M，设计量化copy-paste伪影的基准，提出使用对比性身份损失的新训练范式来平衡身份保真度和多样性。

Result: WithAnyone模型显著减少了copy-paste伪影，提高了姿态和表情的可控性，保持了强感知质量，用户研究验证了高身份保真度和表达能力。

Conclusion: 通过数据集构建、基准设计和对比性损失，WithAnyone有效缓解了copy-paste问题，在身份一致性和生成多样性之间实现了更好的平衡。

Abstract: Identity-consistent generation has become an important focus in text-to-image
research, with recent models achieving notable success in producing images
aligned with a reference identity. Yet, the scarcity of large-scale paired
datasets containing multiple images of the same individual forces most
approaches to adopt reconstruction-based training. This reliance often leads to
a failure mode we term copy-paste, where the model directly replicates the
reference face rather than preserving identity across natural variations in
pose, expression, or lighting. Such over-similarity undermines controllability
and limits the expressive power of generation. To address these limitations, we
(1) construct a large-scale paired dataset MultiID-2M, tailored for
multi-person scenarios, providing diverse references for each identity; (2)
introduce a benchmark that quantifies both copy-paste artifacts and the
trade-off between identity fidelity and variation; and (3) propose a novel
training paradigm with a contrastive identity loss that leverages paired data
to balance fidelity with diversity. These contributions culminate in
WithAnyone, a diffusion-based model that effectively mitigates copy-paste while
preserving high identity similarity. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that WithAnyone significantly reduces copy-paste
artifacts, improves controllability over pose and expression, and maintains
strong perceptual quality. User studies further validate that our method
achieves high identity fidelity while enabling expressive controllable
generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Terra是一个原生3D世界模型，使用内在3D潜在空间表示和生成可探索环境，通过点到高斯变分自编码器和稀疏点流匹配网络实现高3D一致性的世界建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有世界模型大多依赖像素对齐表示，忽略了物理世界固有的3D特性，这会损害3D一致性并降低建模效率。

Method: 提出点到高斯变分自编码器(P2G-VAE)将3D输入编码为潜在点表示，然后解码为3D高斯基元来联合建模几何和外观；引入稀疏点流匹配网络(SPFlow)生成潜在点表示，同时去噪点潜在的位置和特征。

Result: 在ScanNet v2室内场景上的实验表明，Terra在重建和生成方面都达到了最先进的性能，具有高3D一致性。

Conclusion: Terra通过原生3D表示和架构实现了精确的多视角一致性，支持单次生成过程的灵活渲染，并通过点潜在空间中的渐进生成实现了可探索的世界建模。

Abstract: World models have garnered increasing attention for comprehensive modeling of
the real world. However, most existing methods still rely on pixel-aligned
representations as the basis for world evolution, neglecting the inherent 3D
nature of the physical world. This could undermine the 3D consistency and
diminish the modeling efficiency of world models. In this paper, we present
Terra, a native 3D world model that represents and generates explorable
environments in an intrinsic 3D latent space. Specifically, we propose a novel
point-to-Gaussian variational autoencoder (P2G-VAE) that encodes 3D inputs into
a latent point representation, which is subsequently decoded as 3D Gaussian
primitives to jointly model geometry and appearance. We then introduce a sparse
point flow matching network (SPFlow) for generating the latent point
representation, which simultaneously denoises the positions and features of the
point latents. Our Terra enables exact multi-view consistency with native 3D
representation and architecture, and supports flexible rendering from any
viewpoint with only a single generation process. Furthermore, Terra achieves
explorable world modeling through progressive generation in the point latent
space. We conduct extensive experiments on the challenging indoor scenes from
ScanNet v2. Terra achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction
and generation with high 3D consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑模型依赖大规模输入-目标配对数据进行监督微调，但这类自然配对数据难以大规模获取，而使用合成训练对会传播预训练模型的伪影

Method: 直接优化多步扩散模型，训练时展开模型并利用视觉语言模型评估编辑是否遵循指令并保留未改变内容，提供直接梯度进行端到端优化，同时加入分布匹配损失确保视觉保真度

Result: 在标准基准测试中，无需任何配对数据的情况下，在少步设置下与使用大量监督配对数据训练的各种图像编辑扩散模型性能相当，使用相同VLM作为奖励模型时也优于基于强化学习的技术

Conclusion: 提出的无配对数据训练范式能够有效解决图像编辑模型对监督数据的依赖问题，在保持性能的同时避免了合成训练对带来的伪影传播

Abstract: Recent image editing models have achieved impressive results while following
natural language editing instructions, but they rely on supervised fine-tuning
with large datasets of input-target pairs. This is a critical bottleneck, as
such naturally occurring pairs are hard to curate at scale. Current workarounds
use synthetic training pairs that leverage the zero-shot capabilities of
existing models. However, this can propagate and magnify the artifacts of the
pretrained model into the final trained model. In this work, we present a new
training paradigm that eliminates the need for paired data entirely. Our
approach directly optimizes a few-step diffusion model by unrolling it during
training and leveraging feedback from vision-language models (VLMs). For each
input and editing instruction, the VLM evaluates if an edit follows the
instruction and preserves unchanged content, providing direct gradients for
end-to-end optimization. To ensure visual fidelity, we incorporate distribution
matching loss (DMD), which constrains generated images to remain within the
image manifold learned by pretrained models. We evaluate our method on standard
benchmarks and include an extensive ablation study. Without any paired data,
our method performs on par with various image editing diffusion models trained
on extensive supervised paired data, under the few-step setting. Given the same
VLM as the reward model, we also outperform RL-based techniques like Flow-GRPO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决原生视觉语言模型面临的两个核心挑战：与模块化VLMs的根本区别限制，以及如何使原生VLMs研究更加普及和民主化。

Method: 基于三个基本原则构建NEO原生VLMs：(i)在共享语义空间中有效对齐像素和词表示；(ii)无缝整合视觉和语言模块的优势；(iii)内在地体现支持统一视觉语言编码、对齐和推理的跨模态特性。

Result: NEO在仅使用390M图像-文本示例的情况下，能够从零开始高效发展视觉感知，并在各种真实场景中与顶级模块化模型竞争。

Conclusion: NEO为可扩展和强大的原生VLMs奠定了基础，提供了丰富的可重用组件，促进了成本效益高且可扩展的生态系统。

Abstract: The edifice of native Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has emerged as a rising
contender to typical modular VLMs, shaped by evolving model architectures and
training paradigms. Yet, two lingering clouds cast shadows over its widespread
exploration and promotion: (-) What fundamental constraints set native VLMs
apart from modular ones, and to what extent can these barriers be overcome? (-)
How to make research in native VLMs more accessible and democratized, thereby
accelerating progress in the field. In this paper, we clarify these challenges
and outline guiding principles for constructing native VLMs. Specifically, one
native VLM primitive should: (i) effectively align pixel and word
representations within a shared semantic space; (ii) seamlessly integrate the
strengths of formerly separate vision and language modules; (iii) inherently
embody various cross-modal properties that support unified vision-language
encoding, aligning, and reasoning. Hence, we launch NEO, a novel family of
native VLMs built from first principles, capable of rivaling top-tier modular
counterparts across diverse real-world scenarios. With only 390M image-text
examples, NEO efficiently develops visual perception from scratch while
mitigating vision-language conflicts inside a dense and monolithic model
crafted from our elaborate primitives. We position NEO as a cornerstone for
scalable and powerful native VLMs, paired with a rich set of reusable
components that foster a cost-effective and extensible ecosystem. Our code and
models are publicly available at: https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/NEO.

TL;DR: 提出了一种推理时扩散采样方法，通过隐式3D正则化实现多视角一致的图像编辑，避免了显式3D表示的优化过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有2D图像编辑模型在多视角图像编辑时缺乏一致性，而基于显式3D表示的方法存在优化过程长、稀疏视角下不稳定的问题。

Method: 采用耦合扩散采样技术，同时从多视角图像分布和2D编辑图像分布中采样两个轨迹，通过耦合项强制执行多视角一致性。

Result: 在三个不同的多视角图像编辑任务上验证了该框架的有效性和通用性，展示了其跨多种模型架构的适用性。

Conclusion: 该方法作为多视角一致编辑的通用解决方案具有潜力，能够有效保持多视角图像编辑的一致性。

Abstract: We present an inference-time diffusion sampling method to perform multi-view
consistent image editing using pre-trained 2D image editing models. These
models can independently produce high-quality edits for each image in a set of
multi-view images of a 3D scene or object, but they do not maintain consistency
across views. Existing approaches typically address this by optimizing over
explicit 3D representations, but they suffer from a lengthy optimization
process and instability under sparse view settings. We propose an implicit 3D
regularization approach by constraining the generated 2D image sequences to
adhere to a pre-trained multi-view image distribution. This is achieved through
coupled diffusion sampling, a simple diffusion sampling technique that
concurrently samples two trajectories from both a multi-view image distribution
and a 2D edited image distribution, using a coupling term to enforce the
multi-view consistency among the generated images. We validate the
effectiveness and generality of this framework on three distinct multi-view
image editing tasks, demonstrating its applicability across various model
architectures and highlighting its potential as a general solution for
multi-view consistent editing.

*Ashish Kattamuri,Ishita Prasad,Meetu Malhotra,Arpita Vats,Rahul Raja,Albert Lie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合组相对策略优化(GRPO)和多语言对比奖励信号的新框架，用于提升跨语言Text-to-SQL系统的任务效率和语义准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Text-to-SQL方法只关注可执行查询，忽视了语义对齐挑战，包括查询语义含义和执行结果正确性。从英语到其他语言时执行准确率平均下降6个百分点。

Method: 使用GRPO框架结合多语言对比奖励信号，通过基于语义相似度的奖励信号来改善SQL生成与用户意图的对应关系。

Result: 在七语言MultiSpider数据集上，使用GRPO微调LLaMA-3-3B模型，执行准确率提升至87.4%(比零样本+26pp)，语义准确率提升至52.29%(+32.86pp)。添加对比奖励信号后平均语义准确率进一步提升至59.14%(+6.85pp)。

Conclusion: 通过对比奖励信号进行定向语义对齐，可以在不需要大规模训练数据集的情况下显著提升Text-to-SQL系统性能，较小的3B模型微调后甚至能超越更大的8B零样本模型。

Abstract: Current Text-to-SQL methods are evaluated and only focused on executable
queries, overlooking the semantic alignment challenge -- both in terms of the
semantic meaning of the query and the correctness of the execution results.
Even execution accuracy itself shows significant drops when moving from English
to other languages, with an average decline of 6 percentage points across
non-English languages. We address these challenges by presenting a new
framework that combines Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) within a
multilingual contrastive reward signal to enhance both task efficiency and
semantic accuracy in Text-to-SQL systems in cross-lingual scenarios. Our method
teaches models to obtain better correspondence between SQL generation and user
intent by combining a reward signal based on semantic similarity. On the
seven-language MultiSpider dataset, fine-tuning the LLaMA-3-3B model with GRPO
improved the execution accuracy up to 87.4 percent (+26 pp over zero-shot) and
semantic accuracy up to 52.29 percent (+32.86 pp). Adding our contrastive
reward signal in the GRPO framework further improved the average semantic
accuracy to 59.14 percent (+6.85 pp, up to +10 pp for Vietnamese). Our
experiments showcase that a smaller, parameter-efficient 3B LLaMA model
fine-tuned with our contrastive reward signal outperforms a much larger
zero-shot 8B LLaMA model, with an uplift of 7.43 pp in execution accuracy (from
81.43 percent on the 8B model to 88.86 percent on the 3B model), and nearly
matches its semantic accuracy (59.14 percent vs. 68.57 percent) -- all using
just 3,000 reinforcement learning training examples. These results demonstrate
how we can improve the performance of Text-to-SQL systems with contrastive
rewards for directed semantic alignment, without requiring large-scale training
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前XAI技术（如SHAP和LIME）在心理健康筛查中虽然能产生技术准确的输出，但无法提供临床相关、可操作的见解，导致实验室到临床应用的差距。

Method: 提出生成式操作框架，以大语言模型为核心翻译引擎，整合多种XAI工具的技术输出和临床指南（通过RAG），自动生成人类可读、有证据支持的临床叙述。

Result: 该框架直接解决了工作流集成、偏见缓解和利益相关者特定沟通等关键操作障碍。

Conclusion: 为领域提供了战略路线图，推动从孤立数据点生成向提供集成、可操作且可信赖的临床AI发展。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has been presented as the critical
component for unlocking the potential of machine learning in mental health
screening (MHS). However, a persistent lab-to-clinic gap remains. Current XAI
techniques, such as SHAP and LIME, excel at producing technically faithful
outputs such as feature importance scores, but fail to deliver clinically
relevant, actionable insights that can be used by clinicians or understood by
patients. This disconnect between technical transparency and human utility is
the primary barrier to real-world adoption. This paper argues that this gap is
a translation problem and proposes the Generative Operational Framework, a
novel system architecture that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as a
central translation engine. This framework is designed to ingest the raw,
technical outputs from diverse XAI tools and synthesize them with clinical
guidelines (via RAG) to automatically generate human-readable, evidence-backed
clinical narratives. To justify our solution, we provide a systematic analysis
of the components it integrates, tracing the evolution from intrinsic models to
generative XAI. We demonstrate how this framework directly addresses key
operational barriers, including workflow integration, bias mitigation, and
stakeholder-specific communication. This paper also provides a strategic
roadmap for moving the field beyond the generation of isolated data points
toward the delivery of integrated, actionable, and trustworthy AI in clinical
practice.

TL;DR: STELA是一个公开可验证的水印框架，通过基于词性n-元语法的语言不确定性动态调整水印强度，在保持文本质量的同时提高检测鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水印方法依赖模型特定信号（如token级熵），需要访问模型logits，阻碍了公开验证。需要平衡文本质量与检测鲁棒性。

Method: 利用词性n-元语法建模语言不确定性，在语法约束强的上下文减弱水印信号以保持质量，在语言灵活性强的上下文增强水印信号以提高可检测性。检测器无需访问模型logits。

Result: 在分析性英语、孤立性汉语和黏着性韩语等多种语言类型上的实验表明，STELA在检测鲁棒性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: STELA通过语言自由度对齐水印强度，实现了公开可验证的水印检测，在保持文本质量的同时显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance rapidly, reliable
governance tools have become critical. Publicly verifiable watermarking is
particularly essential for fostering a trustworthy AI ecosystem. A central
challenge persists: balancing text quality against detection robustness. Recent
studies have sought to navigate this trade-off by leveraging signals from model
output distributions (e.g., token-level entropy); however, their reliance on
these model-specific signals presents a significant barrier to public
verification, as the detection process requires access to the logits of the
underlying model. We introduce STELA, a novel framework that aligns watermark
strength with the linguistic degrees of freedom inherent in language. STELA
dynamically modulates the signal using part-of-speech (POS) n-gram-modeled
linguistic indeterminacy, weakening it in grammatically constrained contexts to
preserve quality and strengthen it in contexts with greater linguistic
flexibility to enhance detectability. Our detector operates without access to
any model logits, thus facilitating publicly verifiable detection. Through
extensive experiments on typologically diverse languages-analytic English,
isolating Chinese, and agglutinative Korean-we show that STELA surpasses prior
methods in detection robustness. Our code is available at

Motivation: 传统成对偏好数据依赖专业人工标注，成本高且难以规模化。用户在日常使用中产生的偏好标注虽然用户最了解自己的查询，但缺乏质量控制。

Method: 通过两个不同模型生成响应，利用不对称性推断用户数据质量。提出用户行为模型，开发期望最大化算法估计用户潜在质量因子，并据此过滤用户标注数据。

Result: 下游任务验证了该方法在捕捉用户行为和LLM对齐数据过滤方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 用户比较模式可以成为收集成对偏好数据的可行替代方案，通过质量评估机制能够有效利用用户生成的标注数据。

Abstract: Pairwise preference data have played an important role in the alignment of
large language models (LLMs). Each sample of such data consists of a prompt,
two different responses to the prompt, and a binary label indicating which of
the two responses is better. The labels are usually annotated by professional
human annotators. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach to collect
pairwise preference data -- user annotation from comparison mode. With the
increasingly wider adoption of LLMs among the population, users are
contributing more and more of their preference labels through their daily
interactions with the LLMs. The upside of such labels is that users are the
best experts in judging the responses to their own queries/prompts, but the
downside is the lack of quality control in these labels. In this paper, we
consider a new idea of generating two responses from two different models or
two different versions of the same model. The asymmetry allows us to make an
inference of the user's data quality through our proposed user behavior model.
We develop an expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate a latent quality
factor of the user, and filter users' annotation data accordingly. The
downstream task shows the effectiveness of our approach in both capturing the
user behavior and data filtering for LLM alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态token级计算分配方法依赖贪婪路由机制，导致不可逆的信息丢失和次优token选择，限制了LLM在实际应用中的部署效率。

Method: 引入informed routing范式，使用轻量级特征预测器(LFF)在路由决策前预测单元输出，实现灵活的execute-or-approximate策略。

Result: 在语言建模和推理任务上的实验表明，该方法在多个稀疏度水平下实现了最优的效率-性能权衡，无需最终LoRA微调即可匹配或超越需要完全微调的基线方法，同时减少50%以上的训练时间。

Conclusion: informed routing通过前瞻性地评估token重要性和可恢复性，有效解决了现有贪婪路由方法的信息丢失问题，为LLM高效推理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications is
increasingly limited by their high inference cost. While recent advances in
dynamic token-level computation allocation attempt to improve efficiency by
selectively activating model components per token, existing methods rely on
greedy routing--a myopic execute-or-skip mechanism that often leads to
irreversible information loss and suboptimal token selection. This paper
introduces informed routing, a new paradigm that proactively addresses these
issues. The key insight is to assess not only a token's immediate importance
but also its recoverability, i.e., how well its transformation can be
approximated. To this end, we propose the Lightweight Feature Forecaster (LFF),
a small predictive module that estimates a unit's output before routing
decisions are made. This enables a flexible execute-or-approximate policy that
preserves model fidelity while drastically reducing computation. Extensive
experiments on both language modeling and reasoning tasks show that informed
routing achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-performance trade-offs across
multiple sparsity levels. Notably, even without final LoRA fine-tuning, our
method matches or surpasses strong baselines that require full fine-tuning, all
while reducing training time by over 50%. The code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的剪枝标准HIES，结合头部重要性分数和注意力熵，相比仅使用HIS的方法在模型质量和稳定性上有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型虽然性能优异，但多层多头结构导致推理和部署效率问题。现有的基于HIS的剪枝方法仅考虑梯度驱动的贡献，忽略了注意力模式的多样性。

Method: 提出HIES剪枝标准，将头部重要性分数与注意力熵相结合，提供关于每个头部贡献的互补证据。

Result: 基于HIES的剪枝相比仅使用HIS的方法，模型质量提升高达15.2%，稳定性提升2.04倍，实现了显著的模型压缩而不损失准确性或稳定性。

Conclusion: HIES方法有效克服了HIS的局限性，通过整合注意力熵信息，在保持模型性能的同时实现了更好的剪枝效果。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have achieved remarkable performance in NLP tasks.
However, their structural characteristics-multiple layers and attention
heads-introduce efficiency challenges in inference and deployment. To address
these challenges, various pruning methods have recently been proposed. Notably,
gradient-based methods using Head Importance Scores (HIS) have gained traction
for interpretability, efficiency, and ability to identify redundant heads.
However, HIS alone has limitations as it captures only the gradient-driven
contribution, overlooking the diversity of attention patterns. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce a novel pruning criterion, HIES (Head
Importance-Entropy Score), which integrates head importance scores with
attention entropy, providing complementary evidence on per-head contribution.
Empirically, HIES-based pruning yields up to 15.2% improvement in model quality
and 2.04x improvement in stability over HIS-only methods, enabling substantial
model compression without sacrificing either accuracy or stability. Code will
be released upon publication.

Motivation: 现实世界的数据分析任务通常目标不明确且数据不干净，需要用户交互来理解意图，但现有基准测试无法捕捉这些复杂性或支持交互性。

Method: 使用多智能体工作流从公开数据集的见解文章中生成真实基准测试，创建了1,420个对话式数据分析问题，并开发了评估工具。

Result: 评估显示新一代LLM虽然能解决更多问题实例，但在需要持续长时间交互的任务上表现并不更好。

Conclusion: ConDABench为模型构建者提供了衡量真正协作模型在复杂交互任务上进展的途径。

Abstract: Real-world data analysis tasks often come with under-specified goals and
unclean data. User interaction is necessary to understand and disambiguate a
user's intent, and hence, essential to solving these complex tasks. Existing
benchmarks for evaluating LLMs on data analysis tasks do not capture these
complexities or provide first-class support for interactivity. We introduce
ConDABench, a framework for generating conversational data analysis (ConDA)
benchmarks and evaluating external tools on the generated benchmarks. \bench
consists of (a) a multi-agent workflow for generating realistic benchmarks from
articles describing insights gained from public datasets, (b) 1,420 ConDA
problems generated using this workflow, and (c) an evaluation harness that, for
the first time, makes it possible to systematically evaluate conversational
data analysis tools on the generated ConDA problems. Evaluation of
state-of-the-art LLMs on the benchmarks reveals that while the new generation
of models are better at solving more instances, they are not necessarily better
at solving tasks that require sustained, long-form engagement. ConDABench is an
avenue for model builders to measure progress towards truly collaborative
models that can complete complex interactive tasks.

Abstract: When does a large language model (LLM) know what it does not know?
Uncertainty quantification (UQ) provides measures of uncertainty, such as an
estimate of the confidence in an LLM's generated output, and is therefore
increasingly recognized as a crucial component of trusted AI systems. Black-box
UQ methods do not require access to internal model information from the
generating LLM and therefore have numerous real-world advantages, such as
robustness to system changes, adaptability to choice of LLM, reduced costs, and
computational tractability. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of
UQ techniques that are primarily but not necessarily entirely black-box, where
the consistency between a generated output and other sampled generations is
used as a proxy for confidence in its correctness. We propose a high-level
non-verbalized similarity-based aggregation framework that subsumes a broad
swath of UQ approaches suitable for complex generative tasks, as well as
introduce specific novel techniques from the framework that train confidence
estimation models using small training sets. Through an empirical study with
datasets spanning the diverse tasks of question answering, summarization, and
text-to-SQL, we demonstrate that our proposed similarity-based methods can
yield better calibrated confidences than baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一个文化感知的仇恨言论检测框架，通过构建个体仇恨子空间来解决训练标签偏见和文化差异问题，在各项指标上平均优于现有方法1.05%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有仇恨言论检测方法忽视了现实世界的复杂性：训练标签存在偏见，不同文化背景的个体对仇恨言论的理解存在差异。

Method: 构建文化感知框架，通过建模文化属性组合来缓解数据稀疏性，使用标签传播捕捉每个组合的独特特征，最终构建个体仇恨子空间。

Result: 实验表明该方法在所有指标上平均优于最先进方法1.05%。

Conclusion: 文化感知的个体仇恨子空间方法能有效解决仇恨言论检测中的文化差异和标签偏见问题，提升分类性能。

Abstract: Hate speech detection has been extensively studied, yet existing methods
often overlook a real-world complexity: training labels are biased, and
interpretations of what is considered hate vary across individuals with
different cultural backgrounds. We first analyze these challenges, including
data sparsity, cultural entanglement, and ambiguous labeling. To address them,
we propose a culture-aware framework that constructs individuals' hate
subspaces. To alleviate data sparsity, we model combinations of cultural
attributes. For cultural entanglement and ambiguous labels, we use label
propagation to capture distinctive features of each combination. Finally,
individual hate subspaces, which in turn can further enhance classification
performance. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art by 1.05\%
on average across all metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动构建本体耗时耗力且成本高昂，而数字时代需要组织大量非结构化文本，特别是在电子商务领域需要有效组织产品信息。

Method: 利用大语言模型的最新进展，开发了从原始评论文本中自动提取产品本体（以部分关系形式）的全自动方法。

Result: 通过LLM作为评判者的评估显示，该方法生成的本体优于现有的BERT基线模型。

Conclusion: 本研究为更广泛地使用LLM进行本体提取（无论是产品本体还是其他类型）奠定了基础。

Abstract: Ontologies have become essential in today's digital age as a way of
organising the vast amount of readily available unstructured text. In providing
formal structure to this information, ontologies have immense value and
application across various domains, e.g., e-commerce, where countless product
listings necessitate proper product organisation. However, the manual
construction of these ontologies is a time-consuming, expensive and laborious
process. In this paper, we harness the recent advancements in large language
models (LLMs) to develop a fully-automated method of extracting product
ontologies, in the form of meronymies, from raw review texts. We demonstrate
that the ontologies produced by our method surpass an existing, BERT-based
baseline when evaluating using an LLM-as-a-judge. Our investigation provides
the groundwork for LLMs to be used more generally in (product or otherwise)
ontology extraction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ADMIT是一种针对事实核查RAG系统的知识投毒攻击方法，通过少量语义对齐的恶意内容注入，能够翻转事实核查决策并诱导欺骗性解释，无需访问目标LLM或检索器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究真实世界事实核查场景中的知识投毒威胁，因为可信证据通常主导检索结果，传统攻击方法在此环境下效果有限。

Method: 提出ADMIT攻击技术，使用少量样本进行语义对齐的投毒，通过多注入点策略影响检索结果，无需模型访问权限或token级控制。

Result: 在4个检索器、11个LLM和4个跨领域基准测试中，ADMIT平均攻击成功率达86%，投毒率极低（0.93×10^-6），且在强反证存在时仍保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ADMIT比现有最优攻击方法提升11.2%的攻击成功率，揭示了现实世界基于RAG的事实核查系统的严重脆弱性。

Abstract: Knowledge poisoning poses a critical threat to Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems by injecting adversarial content into knowledge bases, tricking
Large Language Models (LLMs) into producing attacker-controlled outputs
grounded in manipulated context. Prior work highlights LLMs' susceptibility to
misleading or malicious retrieved content. However, real-world fact-checking
scenarios are more challenging, as credible evidence typically dominates the
retrieval pool. To investigate this problem, we extend knowledge poisoning to
the fact-checking setting, where retrieved context includes authentic
supporting or refuting evidence. We propose \textbf{ADMIT}
(\textbf{AD}versarial \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{I}njection \textbf{T}echnique), a
few-shot, semantically aligned poisoning attack that flips fact-checking
decisions and induces deceptive justifications, all without access to the
target LLMs, retrievers, or token-level control. Extensive experiments show
that ADMIT transfers effectively across 4 retrievers, 11 LLMs, and 4
cross-domain benchmarks, achieving an average attack success rate (ASR) of 86\%
at an extremely low poisoning rate of $0.93 \times 10^{-6}$, and remaining
robust even in the presence of strong counter-evidence. Compared with prior
state-of-the-art attacks, ADMIT improves ASR by 11.2\% across all settings,
exposing significant vulnerabilities in real-world RAG-based fact-checking
systems.

TL;DR: SerialBEHRT是一个针对医疗领域的预训练基础模型，通过将电子健康记录序列化来更好地捕捉临床事件间的时序依赖关系，在抗生素敏感性预测任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基础模型在处理电子健康记录时难以协调表格化、事件化的数据结构与自然语言模型的序列先验之间的不匹配，限制了它们捕捉患者就诊间纵向依赖关系的能力。

Method: 通过基于SciBERT在结构化EHR序列上进行额外预训练，开发了SerialBEHRT模型，专门设计用于编码临床事件间的时序和上下文关系。

Result: 在抗生素敏感性预测任务上，SerialBEHRT相比现有最先进的EHR表示策略实现了更优越且更一致的性能表现。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在医疗领域基础模型预训练中时序序列化的重要性，SerialBEHRT能够产生更丰富的患者表示。

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models in healthcare has opened new avenues for
learning generalizable representations from large scale clinical data. Yet,
existing approaches often struggle to reconcile the tabular and event based
nature of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with the sequential priors of
natural language models. This structural mismatch limits their ability to
capture longitudinal dependencies across patient encounters. We introduce
SerialBEHRT, a domain aligned foundation model that extends SciBERT through
additional pretraining on structured EHR sequences. SerialBEHRT is designed to
encode temporal and contextual relationships among clinical events, thereby
producing richer patient representations. We evaluate its effectiveness on the
task of antibiotic susceptibility prediction, a clinically meaningful problem
in antibiotic stewardship. Through extensive benchmarking against state of the
art EHR representation strategies, we demonstrate that SerialBEHRT achieves
superior and more consistent performance, highlighting the importance of
temporal serialization in foundation model pretraining for healthcare.

*Jinbin Zhang,Nasib Ullah,Erik Schultheis,Rohit Babbar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DynaSpec通过上下文相关的动态词汇表短列表机制，解决了传统推测解码中固定词汇表子集方法的局限性，提高了解码效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码方法使用固定词汇表子集来加速小模型起草，但这种方法存在两个问题：频率列表依赖语料库且需要重新调整，静态短列表抑制了罕见或领域特定词汇，降低了每次验证步骤的预期接受token数量。

Method: 提出轻量级、粗粒度的元分类器，将上下文路由到少量token聚类中；选定的前k个聚类的并集形成起草器的短列表，同时验证保留完整词汇表和精确性。元分类器通过并行执行起草编码和元短列表计算，在起草器隐藏状态生成之前完成计算。

Result: 在标准推测解码基准测试中，相比固定短列表基线，观察到平均接受长度的一致增益，同时上下文相关选择使得能够使用更小的短列表而不降低接受率。

Conclusion: DynaSpec提供了一种稳健、加速起草并能跨不同任务泛化的动态短列表机制，解决了固定词汇表子集方法的局限性。

Abstract: Speculative decoding (a.k.a. speculative sampling) has become a standard way
to accelerate LLM inference: a small drafter proposes multiple tokens and a
large target model verifies them once per speculation length. Recently, scaling
of the LLM vocabulary has pushed the number of tokens to grow substantially.
While verification over the full vocabulary leaves the target model largely
unaffected, the O(|V|d) parameters in the drafter's output head become a
latency bottleneck, slowing the entire pipeline. Contemporary methods (e.g.,
FR-Spec, VocabTrim) restrict the drafter's vocabulary to a fixed subset of the
target model's vocabulary, ranked in descending order of token frequency.
Although this reduces draft-time compute, it is brittle, since: (i) frequency
lists are corpus-dependent and require retuning to generalize, and (ii) static
shortlists suppress rare or domain-specific tokens, lowering the expected
number of tokens per verification step. We propose DynaSpec, a
context-dependent dynamic shortlisting mechanism that is robust, speeds up
drafting, and generalizes across diverse tasks. Concretely, we introduce
lightweight, coarse-grained meta-classifiers that route contexts to a small
number of token clusters; the union of the top-k selected clusters forms the
drafter's shortlist, while verification retains the full vocabulary and
exactness. The meta-classifier finishes its computation earlier than the
drafter's hidden state generation by exploiting parallel execution of draft
encoding and meta shortlisting on separate streams. On standard
speculative-decoding benchmarks, we observe consistent gains in mean accepted
length over fixed-shortlist baselines, while context-dependent selection
enables smaller shortlists without degrading acceptance.

Motivation: 传统参数高效微调方法在处理同时执行复杂组合任务（如从长对话生成翻译摘要）时存在困难，需要更有效的集成方案。

Method: 在组合的摘要和翻译适配器之上添加可学习投影层，实现任务有效集成，减少计算开销，避免大量重训练或顺序处理。

Result: 实验表明该方法在云端和移动设备上均表现良好且快速，开发了能够无缝执行组合任务的Android应用。

Conclusion: 该方法在现实应用中具有潜力，能够在资源受限环境下实现高速操作，为组合多任务处理提供了有效框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly adapted for diverse downstream
tasks via parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adapters
(LoRA). While adapters can be combined to handle multiple tasks separately,
standard approaches struggle when targeting the simultaneous execution of
complex tasks, such as generating a translated summary from a long
conversation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach tailored
specifically for compositional multi-tasking scenarios involving summarization
and translation. Our technique involves adding a learnable projection layer on
top of the combined summarization and translation adapters. This design enables
effective integration while maintaining efficiency through reduced
computational overhead compared to alternative strategies requiring extensive
retraining or sequential processing. We demonstrate the practical viability of
our method within an on-device environment by developing an Android app capable
of executing compositional tasks seamlessly. Experimental results indicate our
solution performs well and is fast in both cloud-based and on-device
implementations, highlighting the potential benefits of adopting our framework
in real-world applications demanding high-speed operation alongside resource
constraints.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级的推理时方法——潜在空间语言引导，通过PCA识别语言方向并引导token嵌入来控制语言身份，有效减少多语言大语言模型中的意外代码切换问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大语言模型经常出现意外的代码切换现象，这会降低下游任务的可靠性。

Method: 使用PCA在平行翻译数据上识别语言方向，然后沿着这些轴引导token嵌入来控制语言身份，该方法只需要最少的平行数据进行校准。

Result: 使用单个主成分实现了95-99%的语言分类准确率，在Qwen2.5和Llama-3.2模型上，多个语言对的下一个token分布差异减少了高达42%。

Conclusion: 语言身份表征集中在最后几层，具有近乎完美的线性可分性，该方法在保持语义的同时有效缓解代码切换问题，计算开销可忽略不计。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit unintended
code-switching, reducing reliability in downstream tasks. We propose
latent-space language steering, a lightweight inference-time method that
identifies language directions via PCA on parallel translations and steers
token embeddings along these axes to control language identity. Our approach
mitigates code-switching while preserving semantics with negligible
computational overhead and requires only minimal parallel data for calibration.
Empirically, we achieve 95-99\% language classification accuracy using a single
principal component and reduce next-token distributional divergence by up to
42% across multiple language pairs on Qwen2.5 and Llama-3.2 models. We further
analyze the layer-wise evolution of language representations, revealing that
language identity concentrates in final layers with near-perfect linear
separability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受心理语言学中均匀信息密度假说的启发，研究LLMs推理过程中的信息流模式，以解决中间步骤不忠实或难以解释的问题。

Method: 引入基于信息熵的度量方法，分析三个数学基准测试中LLMs推理轨迹的信息密度变化。

Result: 发现成功的LLMs推理具有全局非均匀的信息密度波动特征，与人类沟通模式形成鲜明对比。

Conclusion: 这一发现挑战了机器推理的现有假设，为设计可解释和自适应推理模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often solve problems using step-by-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, yet these intermediate steps are frequently
unfaithful or hard to interpret. Inspired by the Uniform Information Density
(UID) hypothesis in psycholinguistics -- which posits that humans communicate
by maintaining a stable flow of information -- we introduce entropy-based
metrics to analyze the information flow within reasoning traces. Surprisingly,
across three challenging mathematical benchmarks, we find that successful
reasoning in LLMs is globally non-uniform: correct solutions are characterized
by uneven swings in information density, in stark contrast to human
communication patterns. This result challenges assumptions about machine
reasoning and suggests new directions for designing interpretable and adaptive
reasoning models.

TL;DR: EvoEdit是一种新颖的模型编辑策略，通过顺序零空间对齐来缓解灾难性干扰，实现稳定高效的LLM编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于定位-编辑框架的方法在连续编辑场景中存在灾难性干扰问题，新编辑会损害之前的知识更新。

Method: 采用顺序零空间对齐方法，为每个新编辑执行零空间对齐，保留原始和已修改知识表示。

Result: 在真实世界顺序知识编辑基准测试中，EvoEdit达到或优于现有最先进方法，速度提升高达3.53倍。

Conclusion: EvoEdit为动态演化信息环境中的LLM设计提供了简单有效的解决方案，具有强理论保证。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require continual updates to rectify outdated or
erroneous knowledge. Model editing has emerged as a compelling paradigm for
introducing targeted modifications without the computational burden of full
retraining. Existing approaches are mainly based on a locate-then-edit
framework. However, in sequential editing contexts, where multiple updates are
applied over time, they exhibit significant limitations and suffer from
catastrophic interference, i.e., new edits compromise previously integrated
updates and degrade preserved knowledge. To address these challenges, we
introduce EvoEdit, a novel editing strategy that mitigates catastrophic
interference through sequential null-space alignment, enabling stable and
efficient model editing. By performing sequential null-space alignment for each
incoming edit, EvoEdit preserves both original and previously modified
knowledge representations and maintains output invariance on preserved
knowledge even across long edit sequences, effectively mitigating interference.
Evaluations on real-world sequential knowledge-editing benchmarks show that
EvoEdit achieves better or comparable performance than prior state-of-the-art
locate-then-edit techniques, with up to 3.53 times speedup. Overall, these
results underscore the necessity of developing more principled approaches for
designing LLMs in dynamically evolving information settings, while providing a
simple yet effective solution with strong theoretical guarantees.

TL;DR: ConsistencyAI是一个独立基准测试，用于评估不同用户角色下大语言模型的事实一致性，发现模型对相同问题会因用户角色不同而给出不一致的事实回答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试大语言模型在面对不同人口统计特征的用户时，是否会对相同问题给出事实不一致的回答，提供公正的评估和问责机制。

Method: 使用19个LLM，针对15个主题各请求5个事实，每个模型重复查询100次，每次添加不同用户角色的提示上下文，通过句子嵌入计算跨角色余弦相似度来评估事实一致性。

Result: 在100个角色的实验中，一致性得分范围为0.9065-0.7896，平均为0.8656。xAI的Grok-3最一致，轻量级模型最差。不同主题一致性不同：就业市场最不一致，G7领导人最一致。

Conclusion: 模型提供商和主题都会影响事实一致性，需要开发角色不变的提示策略来提高模型的一致性表现。

Abstract: Is an LLM telling you different facts than it's telling me? This paper
introduces ConsistencyAI, an independent benchmark for measuring the factual
consistency of large language models (LLMs) for different personas.
ConsistencyAI tests whether, when users of different demographics ask identical
questions, the model responds with factually inconsistent answers. Designed
without involvement from LLM providers, this benchmark offers impartial
evaluation and accountability. In our experiment, we queried 19 LLMs with
prompts that requested 5 facts for each of 15 topics. We repeated this query
100 times for each LLM, each time adding prompt context from a different
persona selected from a subset of personas modeling the general population. We
processed the responses into sentence embeddings, computed cross-persona cosine
similarity, and computed the weighted average of cross-persona cosine
similarity to calculate factual consistency scores. In 100-persona experiments,
scores ranged from 0.9065 to 0.7896, and the mean was 0.8656, which we adopt as
a benchmark threshold. xAI's Grok-3 is most consistent, while several
lightweight models rank lowest. Consistency varies by topic: the job market is
least consistent, G7 world leaders most consistent, and issues like vaccines or
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict diverge by provider. These results show that
both the provider and the topic shape the factual consistency. We release our
code and interactive demo to support reproducible evaluation and encourage
persona-invariant prompting strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到SQL基准主要关注公开数据集，但在私有企业数据仓库中效果不佳。手动标注SQL日志以创建基准既耗时又昂贵。

Method: 给定SQL查询，使用检索增强生成(RAG)和LLM生成多个自然语言描述草案，然后由人类专家选择、排序或编辑以确保准确性和领域对齐。

Result: 在标注的企业SQL日志上评估显示，LLM辅助标注大幅减少了创建高质量基准所需的时间和精力，提高了标注准确性、基准可靠性和模型评估鲁棒性。

Conclusion: BenchPress通过结合人类验证和LLM生成建议，为研究人员和从业者提供了评估领域特定工作负载上文本到SQL模型的机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied to many tasks,
including text-to-SQL generation. However, much of this work has focused on
publicly available datasets, such as Fiben, Spider, and Bird. Our earlier work
showed that LLMs are much less effective in querying large private enterprise
data warehouses and released Beaver, the first private enterprise text-to-SQL
benchmark. To create Beaver, we leveraged SQL logs, which are often readily
available. However, manually annotating these logs to identify which natural
language questions they answer is a daunting task. Asking database
administrators, who are highly trained experts, to take on additional work to
construct and validate corresponding natural language utterances is not only
challenging but also quite costly. To address this challenge, we introduce
BenchPress, a human-in-the-loop system designed to accelerate the creation of
domain-specific text-to-SQL benchmarks. Given a SQL query, BenchPress uses
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and LLMs to propose multiple natural
language descriptions. Human experts then select, rank, or edit these drafts to
ensure accuracy and domain alignment. We evaluated BenchPress on annotated
enterprise SQL logs, demonstrating that LLM-assisted annotation drastically
reduces the time and effort required to create high-quality benchmarks. Our
results show that combining human verification with LLM-generated suggestions
enhances annotation accuracy, benchmark reliability, and model evaluation
robustness. By streamlining the creation of custom benchmarks, BenchPress
offers researchers and practitioners a mechanism for assessing text-to-SQL
models on a given domain-specific workload. BenchPress is freely available via
our public GitHub repository at

TL;DR: R2T框架将语言规则融入神经网络训练目标，通过自适应损失函数处理OOV词汇，在无标注文本上训练就能在Zarma词性标注任务上达到98.2%准确率，超越有监督基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索原则性学习范式，让模型通过显式任务约束而非仅依赖标注数据进行训练，特别针对低资源语言场景。

Method: 提出Rule-to-Tag框架，在神经网络训练目标中集成多层级语言规则，使用包含正则化项的自适应损失函数来处理OOV词汇的不确定性。

Result: R2T-BiLSTM在仅使用无标注文本训练的情况下，Zarma词性标注准确率达98.2%，优于在300个标注句子上微调的AfriBERTa；在NER任务中，R2T预训练后仅用50个标注句子微调即可超越300个标注句子的基线。

Conclusion: R2T框架在低资源场景下表现出色，证明了原则性学习的有效性，能够显著减少对标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: We introduce the Rule-to-Tag (R2T) framework, a hybrid approach that
integrates a multi-tiered system of linguistic rules directly into a neural
network's training objective. R2T's novelty lies in its adaptive loss function,
which includes a regularization term that teaches the model to handle
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words with principled uncertainty. We frame this work
as a case study in a paradigm we call principled learning (PrL), where models
are trained with explicit task constraints rather than on labeled examples
alone. Our experiments on Zarma part-of-speech (POS) tagging show that the
R2T-BiLSTM model, trained only on unlabeled text, achieves 98.2% accuracy,
outperforming baselines like AfriBERTa fine-tuned on 300 labeled sentences. We
further show that for more complex tasks like named entity recognition (NER),
R2T serves as a powerful pre-training step; a model pre-trained with R2T and
fine-tuned on just 50 labeled sentences outperformes a baseline trained on 300.

Motivation: 不同大语言模型具有互补优势，但集成方法对错误信号的鲁棒性关注不足，这些错误通常源于异构分词方案和模型能力差异。

Method: 提出CoRE技术：token级一致性通过低通滤波器降权高不一致的不确定token；模型级一致性通过促进高自信且与其他模型差异小的输出来建模全局一致性。

Result: 在多样化基准测试、模型组合和集成策略上的广泛实验表明，CoRE能持续提升集成性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CoRE通过双层级一致性机制有效提升LLM集成的鲁棒性，可无缝集成到各种集成方法中。

Abstract: Different large language models (LLMs) exhibit diverse strengths and
weaknesses, and LLM ensemble serves as a promising approach to integrate their
complementary capabilities. Despite substantial progress in improving ensemble
quality, limited attention has been paid to the robustness of ensembles against
potential erroneous signals, which often arise from heterogeneous tokenization
schemes and varying model expertise. Our analysis shows that ensemble failures
typically arise from both the token level and the model level: the former
reflects severe disagreement in token predictions, while the latter involves
low confidence and pronounced disparities among models. In light of this, we
propose CoRE, a plug-and-play technique that harnesses model consistency for
robust LLM ensemble, which can be seamlessly integrated with diverse ensemble
methods. Token-level consistency captures fine-grained disagreements by
applying a low-pass filter to downweight uncertain tokens with high
inconsistency, often due to token misalignment, thereby improving robustness at
a granular level. Model-level consistency models global agreement by promoting
model outputs with high self-confidence and minimal divergence from others,
enhancing robustness at a coarser level. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks, model combinations, and ensemble strategies demonstrate that CoRE
consistently improves ensemble performance and robustness.

TL;DR: MasonNLP系统在MEDIQA-WV 2025伤口护理VQA任务中排名第3，使用基于检索增强生成(RAG)的通用LLM，通过添加相关示例提升临床推理和响应质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗视觉问答(MedVQA)中伤口护理的挑战，支持临床决策和患者护理，需要生成自由文本响应和结构化伤口属性。

Method: 采用通用领域指令调优的大语言模型，结合检索增强生成(RAG)框架，整合领域内文本和视觉示例，无需额外训练或复杂重排。

Result: 在19个团队51个提交中排名第3，平均得分41.37%，在dBLEU、ROUGE、BERTScore和LLM指标上表现优异。

Conclusion: 轻量级RAG与通用LLM结合为多模态临床NLP任务提供了简单有效的基线方法，仅需推理时添加相关示例即可显著提升性能。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) enables natural language queries
over medical images to support clinical decision-making and patient care. The
MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addressed wound-care VQA, requiring systems to
generate free-text responses and structured wound attributes from images and
patient queries. We present the MasonNLP system, which employs a
general-domain, instruction-tuned large language model with a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that incorporates textual and
visual examples from in-domain data. This approach grounds outputs in
clinically relevant exemplars, improving reasoning, schema adherence, and
response quality across dBLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and LLM-based metrics. Our
best-performing system ranked 3rd among 19 teams and 51 submissions with an
average score of 41.37%, demonstrating that lightweight RAG with
general-purpose LLMs -- a minimal inference-time layer that adds a few relevant
exemplars via simple indexing and fusion, with no extra training or complex
re-ranking -- provides a simple and effective baseline for multimodal clinical
NLP tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出ShishuLM高效语言模型架构，通过MLP近似整个transformer块，减少参数和KV缓存需求，在中等上下文场景下实现25%内存降低和40%延迟改善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: transformer模型存在显著内存和计算开销，研究发现架构冗余，有机会在不损失性能下优化，特别是在智能体AI系统中小型语言模型日益重要。

Method: 从AI可解释性和推理时层剪枝研究获得启发，引入ShishuLM架构，在中等上下文场景下利用归一化和注意力计算的近似线性特性，用MLP近似整个transformer块。

Result: 在两个不同规模的小型语言模型上评估，ShishuLM相比父模型在训练和推理时实现25%内存需求降低和40%延迟改善。

Conclusion: 实验和分析结果为从预训练角度构建更高效的小型语言模型架构提供了见解。

Abstract: While the transformer architecture has achieved state-of-the-art performance
on natural language processing tasks, these models impose substantial memory
and computational overhead. Recent research has identified significant
architectural redundancies within these models, presenting opportunities for
optimization without compromising performance. Taking insights from research in
AI interpretability and inference-time layer pruning, we introduce an efficient
language model architecture, referred to as ShishuLM, which reduces both the
parameter count and Key-Value (KV) cache requirements. Given the increasing
importance of Small Language Models (SLMs) in agentic AI systems, we evaluate
our approach on two SLMs of different scales. Our analysis reveals that for
moderate-context scenarios, normalization coupled with attention computation is
roughly linear with the input, enabling entire transformer blocks to be
approximated through Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Our results show that
ShishuLM provides up to 25% reduction in memory requirements and up to 40%
improvement in latency during both training and inference, compared to parent
models. Our experimental and analytical findings provide insights towards
building more efficient SLM architectures from a pre-training standpoint.

*Chenyu Zhang,Sharifa Alghowinem,Cynthia Breazeal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究开发了首个集成LLM框架用于大规模检测辅导对话中的情感状态，分析了16,986个对话轮次，发现学生在AI辅导中通常呈现轻度积极情感和中度兴奋，但学习过程伴随困惑、好奇和偶尔的挫折感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已有研究探讨了LLM在教育中的学习影响，但LLM介导辅导中的情感动态仍未充分理解，需要关注学习者在与AI互动中的情感状态变化。

Method: 分析两个学期16,986个对话轮次，使用三个前沿LLM（Gemini、GPT-4o、Claude）进行零样本情感标注，包括效价、兴奋度和学习帮助性评分，通过排名加权池化和多数共识融合模型输出。

Result: 学生通常报告轻度积极情感和中度兴奋；困惑和好奇是解决问题的常见伴随情感；挫折感虽较少但会阻碍进展；积极状态持续时间稍长但易受干扰；负面情绪常快速消退并转为积极状态；中性时刻常作为转折点。

Conclusion: 情感状态短暂易变，中性时刻可作为辅导干预的关键时机，为负责任地将生成式AI整合到教育中提供了情感层面的见解。

Abstract: While recent studies have examined the leaning impact of large language model
(LLM) in educational contexts, the affective dynamics of LLM-mediated tutoring
remain insufficiently understood. This work introduces the first ensemble-LLM
framework for large-scale affect sensing in tutoring dialogues, advancing the
conversation on responsible pathways for integrating generative AI into
education by attending to learners' evolving affective states. To achieve this,
we analyzed two semesters' worth of 16,986 conversational turns exchanged
between PyTutor, an LLM-powered AI tutor, and 261 undergraduate learners across
three U.S. institutions. To investigate learners' emotional experiences, we
generate zero-shot affect annotations from three frontier LLMs (Gemini, GPT-4o,
Claude), including scalar ratings of valence, arousal, and
learning-helpfulness, along with free-text emotion labels. These estimates are
fused through rank-weighted intra-model pooling and plurality consensus across
models to produce robust emotion profiles. Our analysis shows that during
interaction with the AI tutor, students typically report mildly positive affect
and moderate arousal. Yet learning is not uniformly smooth: confusion and
curiosity are frequent companions to problem solving, and frustration, while
less common, still surfaces in ways that can derail progress. Emotional states
are short-lived--positive moments last slightly longer than neutral or negative
ones, but they are fragile and easily disrupted. Encouragingly, negative
emotions often resolve quickly, sometimes rebounding directly into positive
states. Neutral moments frequently act as turning points, more often steering
students upward than downward, suggesting opportunities for tutors to intervene
at precisely these junctures.

Motivation: 扩散语言模型虽然是有前景的自回归语言模型替代品，但其推理策略仍局限于自回归范式的基于前缀的提示方法

Method: Template Infilling (TI)方法首先生成目标响应的结构模板，然后填充掩码段；引入Dynamic Segment Allocation (DSA)根据生成置信度自适应调整段长度

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，比基线方法提升17.01%；在多令牌生成设置中，能在保持生成质量的同时实现有效加速

Conclusion: TI方法为扩散语言模型提供了更灵活的推理策略，在多个任务上显著提升了性能，并支持多令牌生成加速

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to
Autoregressive Language Models, yet their inference strategies remain limited
to prefix-based prompting inherited from the autoregressive paradigm. In this
paper, we propose Template Infilling (TI), a tailored conditioning methodology
for DLMs' generation process. Unlike conventional prefix prompting, TI first
generates a structural template for the target response, then fills in the
masked segments. To enhance the flexibility of this structural control, we
introduce Dynamic Segment Allocation (DSA), which adaptively adjusts segment
lengths based on generation confidence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks, achieving
consistent improvements of 17.01$\%$p over baseline. Furthermore, we show that
TI provides additional advantages in multi-token generation settings, enabling
effective speedup while maintaining generation quality.

Conclusion: FRACCO为法语肿瘤学文本的命名实体识别和概念标准化提供了参考标准，填补了法语临床肿瘤学资源的空白。

Abstract: Developing natural language processing tools for clinical text requires
annotated datasets, yet French oncology resources remain scarce. We present
FRACCO (FRench Annotated Corpus for Clinical Oncology) an expert-annotated
corpus of 1301 synthetic French clinical cases, initially translated from the
Spanish CANTEMIST corpus as part of the FRASIMED initiative. Each document is
annotated with terms related to morphology, topography, and histologic
differentiation, using the International Classification of Diseases for
Oncology (ICD-O) as reference. An additional annotation layer captures
composite expression-level normalisations that combine multiple ICD-O elements
into unified clinical concepts. Annotation quality was ensured through expert
review: 1301 texts were manually annotated for entity spans by two domain
experts. A total of 71127 ICD-O normalisations were produced through a
combination of automated matching and manual validation by a team of five
annotators. The final dataset representing 399 unique morphology codes (from
2549 different expressions), 272 topography codes (from 3143 different

*Filipe Laitenberger,Dawid Kopiczko,Cees G. M. Snoek,Yuki M. Asano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GateSkip是一种简单的残差流门控机制，通过在解码器语言模型的Attention/MLP分支添加sigmoid-linear门，实现基于令牌重要性的层跳过，从而在推理时节省计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的早退或基于路由器的混合深度模型存在不稳定且需要大量重新训练的问题，需要一种能够在预训练模型上稳定微调的层跳过方法。

Method: 在每个Attention/MLP分支的输出处添加可微分的sigmoid-linear门，根据门值对令牌进行排序，并按每层预算跳过低重要性令牌。

Result: 在长文本推理任务中节省15%计算量同时保持90%以上基线准确率；在指令调优模型上，全计算量时获得准确率提升，50%节省时匹配基线质量。

Conclusion: GateSkip提供了一种稳定高效的层跳过方法，能够与量化、剪枝和自推测解码等技术轻松结合，并为理解Transformer信息流提供洞见。

Abstract: We introduce GateSkip, a simple residual-stream gating mechanism that enables
token-wise layer skipping in decoder-only LMs. Each Attention/MLP branch is
equipped with a sigmoid-linear gate that condenses the branch's output before
it re-enters the residual stream. During inference we rank tokens by the gate
values and skip low-importance ones using a per-layer budget. While early-exit
or router-based Mixture-of-Depths models are known to be unstable and need
extensive retraining, our smooth, differentiable gates fine-tune stably on top
of pretrained models. On long-form reasoning, we save up to 15\% compute while
retaining over 90\% of baseline accuracy. On instruction-tuned models we see
accuracy gains at full compute and match baseline quality near 50\% savings.
The learned gates give insight into transformer information flow (e.g., BOS
tokens act as anchors), and the method combines easily with quantization,
pruning, and self-speculative decoding.

TL;DR: 研究者提出了一个纯文本反馈的多臂老虎机基准测试，评估LLMs在不确定性下的顺序决策能力。Qwen3-4B模型表现最佳，达到89.2%的最佳臂选择率，超越了传统算法和其他LLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs仅使用自然语言在不确定性下进行顺序决策的能力，这一能力目前尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 创建多臂老虎机环境，LLMs仅通过文本反馈（"你获得了一个代币"）与环境交互，没有数值线索或显式概率信息，需要从语言线索推断潜在奖励结构。

Result: 大多数LLMs表现不如基线算法，但Qwen3-4B达到了89.2%的最佳臂选择率，显著优于更大的LLMs和传统方法（如Thompson Sampling、Epsilon Greedy、UCB）。

Conclusion: 概率推理能力可以从纯语言中涌现，该基准测试为评估自然主义、非数值环境中的决策能力迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown to be increasingly capable of
performing reasoning tasks, but their ability to make sequential decisions
under uncertainty only using natural language remains underexplored. We
introduce a novel benchmark in which LLMs interact with multi-armed bandit
environments using purely textual feedback, "you earned a token", without
access to numerical cues or explicit probabilities, resulting in the model to
infer latent reward structures purely off linguistic cues and to adapt
accordingly. We evaluated the performance of four open-source LLMs and compare
their performance to standard decision-making algorithms such as Thompson
Sampling, Epsilon Greedy, Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), and random choice.
While most of the LLMs underperformed compared to the baselines, Qwen3-4B,
achieved the best-arm selection rate of 89.2% , which significantly
outperformed both the larger LLMs and traditional methods. Our findings suggest
that probabilistic reasoning is able to emerge from language alone, and we
present this benchmark as a step towards evaluating decision-making
capabilities in naturalistic, non-numeric contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种让语言模型动态调整每个输入token计算步数的监督训练方法，模型可以通过输出<don't know>请求额外计算时间，使用<pause>token获得更多计算资源来生成输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 让语言模型能够根据输入token的复杂性自主决定所需的计算量，在不确定时请求更多计算时间以提高准确性。

Method: 提出了Catch Your Breath损失函数系列，包括CYB-AP（随时预测）、CYB-VA（变分方法）和CYB-DP（计算预算惩罚），通过微调实验确定最佳变体。

Result: CYB模型仅需基线模型1/3的训练数据即可达到相同性能，比使用暂停和交叉熵损失的模型少用一半数据。模型会根据token复杂性自适应调整处理时间。

Conclusion: 该方法使语言模型能够智能地分配计算资源，在复杂或模糊的token上请求更多计算时间，提高整体效率。

Abstract: We explore a class of supervised training objectives that allow a language
model to dynamically and autonomously scale the number of compute steps used
for each input token. For any token, the model can request additional compute
steps by emitting a <don't know> output. If the model is granted a delay, a
specialized <pause> token is inserted at the next input step, providing the
model with additional compute resources to generate an output. The model can
request multiple pauses. To train the model to use <don't know> outputs
judiciously and to calibrate its uncertainty, we frame the selection of each
output token as a sequential-decision problem with a time cost. We refer to the
class of methods as $\textit{Catch Your Breath}$ losses and we study three
methods in this class: CYB-AP frames the model's task as anytime prediction,
where an output may be required at any step and accuracy is discounted over
time; CYB-VA is a variational approach that aims to maximize prediction
accuracy subject to a specified distribution over stopping times; and CYB-DP
imposes a penalty based on a computational budget. Through fine-tuning
experiments, we identify the best performing loss variant. The CYB model needs
only one third as much training data as the baseline (no pause) model needs to
achieve the same performance, and half as much data as a model with pauses and
a cross-entropy loss. We find that the CYB model requests additional steps when
doing so improves accuracy, and the model adapts its processing time to
token-level complexity and context. For example, it often pauses after plural
nouns like $\textit{patients}$ and $\textit{challenges}$ but never pauses after
the first token of contracted words like $\textit{wasn}$ and $\textit{didn}$,
and it shows high variability for ambiguous tokens like $\textit{won}$, which
could function as either a verb or part of a contraction.

Conclusion: PAGE提供了一种简单、模块化的架构，易于适应不同任务，无需复杂的辅助生成模型

Abstract: In recent years, natural language generative models have shown outstanding
performance in text generation tasks. However, when facing specific tasks or
particular requirements, they may exhibit poor performance or require
adjustments that demand large amounts of additional data. This work introduces
PAGE (Prompt Augmentation for text Generation Enhancement), a framework
designed to assist these models through the use of simple auxiliary modules.
These modules, lightweight models such as classifiers or extractors, provide
inferences from the input text. The output of these auxiliaries is then used to
construct an enriched input that improves the quality and controllability of
the generation. Unlike other generation-assistance approaches, PAGE does not
require auxiliary generative models; instead, it proposes a simpler, modular
architecture that is easy to adapt to different tasks. This paper presents the
proposal, its components and architecture, and reports a proof of concept in
the domain of requirements engineering, where an auxiliary module with a
classifier is used to improve the quality of software requirements generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数LLM社会模拟研究局限于多项选择或简答格式，忽视了LLM的生成性本质，无法充分捕捉真实社会现象中的观点多样性和推理过程。

Method: 基于调查方法学研究和NLP最新进展，提出开放式文本生成方法，允许LLM自由表达观点、主题和推理过程。

Result: 开放式方法能改善测量和设计、探索未预期观点、减少研究者偏见、捕捉表达性和个体性、辅助预测试，并增强方法效用。

Conclusion: 呼吁开发新的实践和评估框架，充分利用LLM的开放式生成多样性，促进NLP与社会科学的协同发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate public opinion
and other social phenomena. Most current studies constrain these simulations to
multiple-choice or short-answer formats for ease of scoring and comparison, but
such closed designs overlook the inherently generative nature of LLMs. In this
position paper, we argue that open-endedness, using free-form text that
captures topics, viewpoints, and reasoning processes "in" LLMs, is essential
for realistic social simulation. Drawing on decades of survey-methodology
research and recent advances in NLP, we argue why this open-endedness is
valuable in LLM social simulations, showing how it can improve measurement and
design, support exploration of unanticipated views, and reduce
researcher-imposed directive bias. It also captures expressiveness and
individuality, aids in pretesting, and ultimately enhances methodological
utility. We call for novel practices and evaluation frameworks that leverage
rather than constrain the open-ended generative diversity of LLMs, creating
synergies between NLP and social science.

Motivation: 评估当代大语言模型在非结构化文本分类任务中的实际表现，探索模型规模与架构改进是否足以保证更好的分类准确性。

Method: 使用统一的8,660个人工标注样本和相同的零样本提示，对10个LLMs进行评估，采用经典指标和LLM特定指标，并开发了集成方法进行对比。

Result: 当代LLMs平均准确率34%，精确率42%，召回率45%，F1分数41%；幻觉和膨胀比率较高；集成方法显著提高准确率，减少膨胀，完全消除幻觉。

Conclusion: 模型协调编排比单纯扩大规模更有效，集成方法为实现或超越人类专家水平的大规模文本分类提供了最有希望的路径。

Abstract: This study presents a comparative evaluation of ten state-of-the-art large
language models (LLMs) applied to unstructured text categorization using the
Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) 2.2 hierarchical taxonomy. The analysis
employed a uniform dataset of 8,660 human-annotated samples and identical
zero-shot prompts to ensure methodological consistency across all models.
Evaluation metrics included four classic measures - accuracy, precision,
recall, and F1-score - and three LLM-specific indicators: hallucination ratio,
inflation ratio, and categorization cost.
  Results show that, despite their rapid advancement, contemporary LLMs achieve
only moderate classic performance, with average scores of 34% accuracy, 42%
precision, 45% recall, and 41% F1-score. Hallucination and inflation ratios
reveal that models frequently overproduce categories relative to human
annotators. Among the evaluated systems, Gemini 1.5/2.0 Flash and GPT 20B/120B
offered the most favorable cost-to-performance balance, while GPT 120B
demonstrated the lowest hallucination ratio. The findings suggest that scaling
and architectural improvements alone do not ensure better categorization
accuracy, as the task requires compressing rich unstructured text into a
limited taxonomy - a process that challenges current model architectures.
  To address these limitations, a separate ensemble-based approach was
developed and tested. The ensemble method, in which multiple LLMs act as
independent experts, substantially improved accuracy, reduced inflation, and
completely eliminated hallucinations. These results indicate that coordinated
orchestration of models - rather than sheer scale - may represent the most
effective path toward achieving or surpassing human-expert performance in
large-scale text categorization.

Conclusion: ProofGrader证明了细粒度证明评估器的可行性，有潜力推动下游证明生成任务的进展。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) for mathematical reasoning
have largely focused on tasks with easily verifiable final answers; however,
generating and verifying natural language math proofs remains an open
challenge. We identify the absence of a reliable, fine-grained evaluator for
LLM-generated math proofs as a critical gap. To address this, we propose a
systematic methodology for developing and validating evaluators that assign
fine-grained scores on a 0-7 scale to model-generated math proofs. To enable
this study, we introduce ProofBench, the first expert-annotated dataset of
fine-grained proof ratings, spanning 145 problems from six major math
competitions (USAMO, IMO, Putnam, etc) and 435 LLM-generated solutions from
Gemini-2.5-pro, o3, and DeepSeek-R1. %with expert gradings. Using ProofBench as
a testbed, we systematically explore the evaluator design space across key
axes: the backbone model, input context, instructions and evaluation workflow.
Our analysis delivers ProofGrader, an evaluator that combines a strong
reasoning backbone LM, rich context from reference solutions and marking
schemes, and a simple ensembling method; it achieves a low Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) of 0.926 against expert scores, significantly outperforming naive
baselines. Finally, we demonstrate its practical utility in a best-of-$n$
selection task: at $n=16$, ProofGrader achieves an average score of 4.14 (out
of 7), closing 78% of the gap between a naive binary evaluator (2.48) and the
human oracle (4.62), highlighting its potential to advance downstream proof
generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced many domains and applications but
face high fine-tuning costs, inference latency, limited edge deployability, and
reliability concerns. Small language models (SLMs), compact, efficient, and
adaptable, offer complementary remedies. Recent work explores collaborative
frameworks that fuse SLMs' specialization and efficiency with LLMs'
generalization and reasoning to meet diverse objectives across tasks and
deployment scenarios. Motivated by these developments, this paper presents a
systematic survey of SLM-LLM collaboration organized by collaboration
objectives. We propose a taxonomy with four goals: performance enhancement,
cost-effectiveness, cloud-edge privacy, and trustworthiness. Within this
framework, we review representative methods, summarize design paradigms, and
outline open challenges and future directions toward efficient, secure, and
scalable SLM-LLM collaboration.

TL;DR: THTB框架通过认知科学启发的方法进行指令数据选择和标注指导，结合质量过滤与内在/外在难度评分，使模型仅用5%数据就能超越全数据集训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在高质量SFT数据选择上过度依赖LLM内部知识、可解释性差且泛化能力有限，需要更有效的选择标准。

Method: 提出THTB框架，结合质量过滤与内在/外在难度评分，优先选择更高认知层次的指令数据，提供可解释的量化标准。

Result: 仅使用5%数据训练的模型就能超越全数据集训练，在垂直领域仅用2%数据就能超越更大数据集训练的模型。

Conclusion: THTB在数据选择和标注指导方面都表现出色，具有强大的领域适应潜力，为高效SFT提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general tasks, but adapting them to
specialized domains relies on high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data.
Although existing methods can identify subsets of high-quality data and reduce
training cost to some extent, their selection process still suffers from
over-reliance on LLMs' internal knowledge, weak interpretability, and limited
generalization. To address these limitations, we propose THTB (The Harder The
Better), a cognitive science-inspired framework for instruction data selection
and annotation guidance. THTB prioritizes higher-level cognitive instructions
by combining quality filtering with intrinsic and extrinsic hardness scoring,
offering interpretable and quantifiable criteria for efficient SFT, both in
data selection and annotation guidance. Experiments show that THTB enables
models trained on only 5% of the data to outperform full-dataset training,
while achieving superior generalization compared with LLM-only selection. In
addition, THTB provides effective annotation guidance in vertical domains,
enabling a model trained on just 2% of the data to surpass models trained on
much larger datasets, demonstrating strong potential for domain adaptation. Our
code, datasets, and models are available on

*Olga E. Sorokoletova,Francesco Giarrusso,Vincenzo Suriani,Daniele Nardi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过结构化红队挑战开发了包含50种越狱策略的全面分层分类法，分析了不同攻击类型的流行度和成功率，评估了基于分类法的自动检测方法，并创建了包含1364个多轮对抗对话的意大利语数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法主要关注单轮攻击，缺乏跨语言覆盖，且依赖有限的分类法，无法充分捕捉攻击策略的多样性或过于强调风险类别而非越狱技术本身。

Method: 采用结构化红队挑战方法，开发了包含7大类（冒充、说服、权限提升、认知过载、混淆、目标冲突、数据投毒）的50种越狱策略分层分类法，并收集多轮对抗对话数据。

Result: 构建了全面的越狱策略分类体系，分析了不同攻击策略的成功率和模型漏洞利用方式，评估了基于分类法提示的自动检测效果，创建了标注的多语言对抗对话数据集。

Conclusion: 该研究推进了对越狱技术有效性的理解，提供了系统化的分类框架和数据集，有助于改进大语言模型的安全防御机制。

Abstract: Jailbreaking techniques pose a significant threat to the safety of Large
Language Models (LLMs). Existing defenses typically focus on single-turn
attacks, lack coverage across languages, and rely on limited taxonomies that
either fail to capture the full diversity of attack strategies or emphasize
risk categories rather than the jailbreaking techniques. To advance the
understanding of the effectiveness of jailbreaking techniques, we conducted a
structured red-teaming challenge. The outcome of our experiments are manifold.
First, we developed a comprehensive hierarchical taxonomy of 50 jailbreak
strategies, consolidating and extending prior classifications into seven broad
families, including impersonation, persuasion, privilege escalation, cognitive
overload, obfuscation, goal conflict, and data poisoning. Second, we analyzed
the data collected from the challenge to examine the prevalence and success
rates of different attack types, providing insights into how specific jailbreak
strategies exploit model vulnerabilities and induce misalignment. Third, we
benchmark a popular LLM for jailbreak detection, evaluating the benefits of
taxonomy-guided prompting for improving automatic detection. Finally, we
compiled a new Italian dataset of 1364 multi-turn adversarial dialogues,
annotated with our taxonomy, enabling the study of interactions where
adversarial intent emerges gradually and succeeds in bypassing traditional
safeguards.

TL;DR: 本文比较了两种作者归属方法：固定风格嵌入和指令调优的LLM法官(GPT-4o)，在包含6个领域600个实例的Human AI Parallel Corpus上进行测试，发现两种方法在不同领域各有优势，表明作者归属需要混合策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型生成的文本质量接近人类写作，作者归属变得越来越具有挑战性，需要开发有效的归属机制来区分人类和AI生成的内容。

Method: 使用固定风格嵌入和指令调优的LLM法官(GPT-4o)两种方法，在Human AI Parallel Corpus数据集上进行测试，该数据集包含6个领域600个平衡实例，每个实例包含人类提示、黄金延续和LLM生成的延续。

Result: 风格嵌入在GPT延续上表现更好(82% vs 68%)，LLM法官在LLaMA延续上略优(85% vs 81%)但统计不显著。LLM法官在小说和学术散文上显著优于风格嵌入，而风格嵌入在口语和剧本对话中表现更好。

Conclusion: 作者归属是一个多维问题，需要混合策略。两种方法在不同领域各有优势：LLM法官具有语义敏感性，风格嵌入在结构特征上更强。提供了开源框架支持可复现性。

Abstract: Attributing authorship in the era of large language models (LLMs) is
increasingly challenging as machine-generated prose rivals human writing. We
benchmark two complementary attribution mechanisms , fixed Style Embeddings and
an instruction-tuned LLM judge (GPT-4o) on the Human AI Parallel Corpus, an
open dataset of 600 balanced instances spanning six domains (academic, news,
fiction, blogs, spoken transcripts, and TV/movie scripts). Each instance
contains a human prompt with both a gold continuation and an LLM-generated
continuation from either GPT-4o or LLaMA-70B-Instruct. The Style Embedding
baseline achieves stronger aggregate accuracy on GPT continuations (82 pct vs.
68 pct). The LLM Judge is slightly better than the Style embeddings on LLaMA
continuations (85 pct vs. 81 pct) but the results are not statistically
significant. Crucially, the LLM judge significantly outperforms in fiction and
academic prose, indicating semantic sensitivity, whereas embeddings dominate in
spoken and scripted dialogue, reflecting structural strengths. These
complementary patterns highlight attribution as a multidimensional problem
requiring hybrid strategies. To support reproducibility we provide code on
GitHub and derived data on Hugging Face under the MIT license. This open
framework provides a reproducible benchmark for attribution quality assessment
in AI-generated content, along with a review of related literature influencing
this work.

TL;DR: 窄域微调会在LLM激活中产生强烈偏差，这些偏差可以通过模型差异分析来解释微调领域，并用于生成类似微调数据格式和内容的文本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究窄域微调对LLM激活的影响，揭示微调过程中产生的偏差，并探讨这些偏差对AI安全和可解释性研究的意义。

Method: 使用模型差异分析工具，分析随机文本前几个token的激活差异，并通过将这些差异添加到模型激活中来引导文本生成。创建基于LLM的可解释性代理来理解微调领域。

Result: 发现窄域微调模型在其激活中包含训练目标的显著痕迹；使用偏差信息的代理性能显著优于简单提示的基线代理；混合预训练数据可以很大程度上消除这些偏差。

Conclusion: 窄域微调模型在激活中存在明显偏差，这对AI安全和可解释性研究具有重要影响，需要开发更真实的案例研究来改进模型差异分析、安全和可解释性研究。

Abstract: Finetuning on narrow domains has become an essential tool to adapt Large
Language Models (LLMs) to specific tasks and to create models with known
unusual properties that are useful for research. We show that narrow finetuning
creates strong biases in LLM activations that can be interpreted to understand
the finetuning domain. These biases can be discovered using simple tools from
model diffing - the study of differences between models before and after
finetuning. In particular, analyzing activation differences on the first few
tokens of random text and steering by adding this difference to the model
activations produces text similar to the format and general content of the
finetuning data. We demonstrate that these analyses contain crucial information
by creating an LLM-based interpretability agent to understand the finetuning
domain. With access to the bias, the agent performs significantly better
compared to baseline agents using simple prompting. Our analysis spans
synthetic document finetuning for false facts, emergent misalignment,
subliminal learning, and taboo word guessing game models across different
architectures (Gemma, LLaMA, Qwen) and scales (1B to 32B parameters). We
suspect these biases reflect overfitting and find that mixing pretraining data
into the finetuning corpus largely removes them, though residual risks may
remain. Our work (1) demonstrates that narrowly finetuned models have salient
traces of their training objective in their activations and suggests ways to
improve how they are trained, (2) warns AI safety and interpretability
researchers that the common practice of using such models as a proxy for
studying broader finetuning (e.g., chat-tuning) might not be realistic, and (3)
highlights the need for deeper investigation into the effects of narrow
finetuning and development of truly realistic case studies for model-diffing,
safety and interpretability research.

TL;DR: RAID是一个针对大语言模型的越狱攻击框架，通过优化对抗性后缀来绕过安全机制，在嵌入空间中使用拒绝感知正则化提高攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然在各种任务上表现出色，但仍容易受到越狱攻击的威胁，现有方法在攻击效果和效率上存在不足。

Method: RAID将离散token松弛为连续嵌入，通过联合优化目标（鼓励受限响应、拒绝感知正则化、连贯性约束）来生成对抗性后缀，并使用批评指导的解码过程将嵌入映射回token。

Result: 在多个开源LLM上的实验表明，RAID相比现有白盒和黑盒基线方法，能以更少的查询和更低的计算成本获得更高的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 研究强调了嵌入空间正则化对于理解和缓解LLM越狱漏洞的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance across diverse
tasks yet remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass safety mechanisms.
We present RAID (Refusal-Aware and Integrated Decoding), a framework that
systematically probes these weaknesses by crafting adversarial suffixes that
induce restricted content while preserving fluency. RAID relaxes discrete
tokens into continuous embeddings and optimizes them with a joint objective
that (i) encourages restricted responses, (ii) incorporates a refusal-aware
regularizer to steer activations away from refusal directions in embedding
space, and (iii) applies a coherence term to maintain semantic plausibility and
non-redundancy. After optimization, a critic-guided decoding procedure maps
embeddings back to tokens by balancing embedding affinity with language-model
likelihood. This integration yields suffixes that are both effective in
bypassing defenses and natural in form. Experiments on multiple open-source
LLMs show that RAID achieves higher attack success rates with fewer queries and
lower computational cost than recent white-box and black-box baselines. These
findings highlight the importance of embedding-space regularization for
understanding and mitigating LLM jailbreak vulnerabilities.

TL;DR: 本文分析了大型语言模型在道德和政治领域的偏见，使用道德基础理论框架比较LLM响应与人类数据，评估LLM是否表现出意识形态倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在日常生活中的广泛应用，特别是在医疗、人际关系和法律等关键领域，需要了解LLM在政治和道德领域的响应是否存在偏见。

Method: 使用道德基础理论框架，分析LLM在不同条件下的响应：固有响应、直接政治意识形态表达、以及基于构建人物角色的响应。

Result: 研究发现LLM响应确实存在意识形态倾向，并且能够通过明确提示和基于人口统计的角色扮演来准确表示意识形态观点。

Conclusion: LLM生成的响应具有政治和人口统计依赖性，这为理解AI生成内容中的偏见提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly incorporated into
everyday life for many internet users, taking on significant roles as advice
givers in the domains of medicine, personal relationships, and even legal
matters. The importance of these roles raise questions about how and what
responses LLMs make in difficult political and moral domains, especially
questions about possible biases. To quantify the nature of potential biases in
LLMs, various works have applied Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), a framework
that categorizes human moral reasoning into five dimensions: Harm, Fairness,
Ingroup Loyalty, Authority, and Purity. Previous research has used the MFT to
measure differences in human participants along political, national, and
cultural lines. While there has been some analysis of the responses of LLM with
respect to political stance in role-playing scenarios, no work so far has
directly assessed the moral leanings in the LLM responses, nor have they
connected LLM outputs with robust human data. In this paper we analyze the
distinctions between LLM MFT responses and existing human research directly,
investigating whether commonly available LLM responses demonstrate ideological
leanings: either through their inherent responses, straightforward
representations of political ideologies, or when responding from the
perspectives of constructed human personas. We assess whether LLMs inherently
generate responses that align more closely with one political ideology over
another, and additionally examine how accurately LLMs can represent ideological
perspectives through both explicit prompting and demographic-based
role-playing. By systematically analyzing LLM behavior across these conditions
and experiments, our study provides insight into the extent of political and
demographic dependency in AI-generated responses.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于认知科学中图式理论的新框架SA-ICL，通过从示例中提取抽象推理模式来增强语言模型在上下文学习中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于示例的上下文学习缺乏在抽象层面进行知识检索和迁移的显式模块，而人类认知依赖于预存的心理框架（图式）来理解新信息。

Method: SA-ICL框架从先前的示例中提取推理过程的认知构建块表示，创建轻量级、结构化的抽象图式模板，用于增强模型面对新问题时的推理过程。

Result: 在GPQA数据集的化学和物理问题上，SA-ICL持续提升性能，最高达36.19%，同时减少对演示示例数量的依赖并增强可解释性。

Conclusion: SA-ICL不仅连接了从模式启动到思维链提示的各种ICL策略，还为增强LLMs中类人推理开辟了新路径。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) enables transformer-based language models to adapt
to new tasks by conditioning on demonstration examples. However, traditional
example-driven in-context learning lacks explicit modules for knowledge
retrieval and transfer at the abstraction level. Inspired by cognitive science,
specifically schema theory, which holds that humans interpret new information
by activating pre-existing mental frameworks (schemas) to structure
understanding, we introduce SCHEMA ACTIVATED IN CONTEXT LEARNING (SA-ICL). This
framework extracts the representation of the building blocks of cognition for
the reasoning process instilled from prior examples, creating an abstracted
schema, a lightweight, structured template of key inferential steps and their
relationships, which is then used to augment a model's reasoning process when
presented with a novel question. We demonstrate that a broad range of large
language models (LLMs) lack the capacity to form and utilize internal
schema-based learning representations implicitly, but instead benefit
significantly from explicit schema-based scaffolding. Across chemistry and
physics questions from the GPQA dataset, our experiments show that SA-ICL
consistently boosts performance, up to 36.19 percent, when the single
demonstration example is of high quality, which simultaneously reduces reliance
on the number of demonstrations and enhances interpretability. SCHEMA ACTIVATED
IN CONTEXT LEARNING not only bridges disparate ICL strategies ranging from
pattern priming to Chain-of-Thought prompting, but also paves a new path for
enhancing human-like reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了Prompt Duel Optimizer (PDO)，一个无需标签的高效提示优化框架，使用双人赌博机设置和LLM法官的成对偏好反馈来优化提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动提示优化方法需要真实标签数据，但在实践中收集高质量标签成本高且耗时，因此需要无需标签的优化方法。

Method: PDO将问题建模为双人赌博机设置，结合Double Thompson Sampling（D-TS）和Top-Performer Guided Mutation，通过LLM法官的成对偏好反馈进行优化。

Result: 在BIG-bench Hard (BBH)和MS MARCO上的实验表明，PDO持续优于基线方法，消融研究验证了D-TS和提示变异策略的有效性。

Conclusion: PDO提供了一种无需标签的高效提示优化解决方案，能够有效利用LLM法官的偏好反馈，在缺乏真实标签的情况下实现优秀的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to their input prompts,
making prompt design a central challenge. While automatic prompt optimization
(APO) reduces manual engineering, most approaches assume access to ground-truth
references such as labeled validation data. In practice, however, collecting
high-quality labels is costly and slow. We propose the Prompt Duel Optimizer
(PDO), a sample-efficient framework for label-free prompt optimization. PDO
formulates the problem as a dueling-bandit setting, where supervision signal
comes from pairwise preference feedback provided by an LLM judge. The framework
combines Double Thompson Sampling (D-TS), which prioritizes informative prompt
comparisons, with Top-Performer Guided Mutation, which expands the candidate
pool by mutating high-performing prompts. PDO naturally operates in label-free
settings and can also incorporate partial labels to mitigate judge noise.
Experiments on BIG-bench Hard (BBH) and MS MARCO show that PDO consistently
outperforms baseline methods. Ablation studies further demonstrate the
effectiveness of both D-TS and prompt mutation.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在算术任务上表现不佳，现有研究主要关注输出或提示策略，但缺乏对模型内部算术计算结构的研究。

Method: 构建包含三个操作数和两个运算符的算术表达式数据集，使用logit lens、线性分类探针和UMAP几何可视化等可解释性技术分析模型内部表示。

Result: 发现中间计算出现在残差流中，模型在注意力层后线性编码了每个运算符的优先级，并引入了部分嵌入交换技术来修改运算符优先级。

Conclusion: LLMs确实在内部表示中编码了算术运算符优先级，这为理解模型算术计算机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities but continue to struggle with arithmetic tasks. Prior works
largely focus on outputs or prompting strategies, leaving the open question of
the internal structure through which models do arithmetic computation. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs encode operator precedence in their internal
representations via the open-source instruction-tuned LLaMA 3.2-3B model. We
constructed a dataset of arithmetic expressions with three operands and two
operators, varying the order and placement of parentheses. Using this dataset,
we trace whether intermediate results appear in the residual stream of the
instruction-tuned LLaMA 3.2-3B model. We apply interpretability techniques such
as logit lens, linear classification probes, and UMAP geometric visualization.
Our results show that intermediate computations are present in the residual
stream, particularly after MLP blocks. We also find that the model linearly
encodes precedence in each operator's embeddings post attention layer. We
introduce partial embedding swap, a technique that modifies operator precedence
by exchanging high-impact embedding dimensions between operators.

<details>

Motivation: 现有LLM-based KGFMs在整合LLM知识和KG上下文时，LLM的内在知识可能被稀疏的KG上下文所淹没，导致知识扭曲和生成幻觉，限制了推理结果的可信度。

Method: 设计了知识推理语言(KRL)指令格式和分词器来对齐LLM知识和KG表示；提出了KRL注意力层通过动态知识记忆机制协调内在LLM知识和额外KG上下文；设计了结构感知的下一个实体预测器来严格约束推理结果在可信知识域内。

Result: 在25个真实世界归纳KGR数据集上的实验结果表明，KRLM在零样本推理和微调场景中都表现出显著优势。

Conclusion: KRLM通过统一协调LLM知识和KG上下文，有效解决了知识扭曲和生成幻觉问题，提升了归纳知识图谱推理的性能和可信度。

Abstract: Inductive Knowledge Graph Reasoning (KGR) aims to discover facts in
open-domain KGs containing unknown entities and relations, which poses a
challenge for KGR models in comprehending uncertain KG components. Existing
studies have proposed Knowledge Graph Foundation Models (KGFMs) that learn
structural invariances across KGs to handle this uncertainty. Recently, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities for open-domain
knowledge reasoning. As a result, the latest research has focused on LLM-based
KGFMs that integrate LLM knowledge with KG context for inductive KGR. However,
the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs may be overshadowed by sparse KG context,
leading to LLM knowledge distortion, which can cause irreversible damage to
model reasoning. Moreover, existing LLM-based KGR methods still struggle to
fully constrain generative hallucinations in LLMs, severely limiting the
credibility of reasoning results. To address these limitations, we propose a
Knowledge Reasoning Language Model (KRLM) that achieves unified coordination
between LLM knowledge and KG context throughout the KGR process. Specifically,
we design a Knowledge Reasoning Language (KRL) instruction format and a KRL
tokenizer to align LLM knowledge with KG representations. Then, we propose a
KRL attention layer that coordinates intrinsic LLM knowledge with additional KG
context through a dynamic knowledge memory mechanism. Finally, a
structure-aware next-entity predictor is proposed, which strictly constrains
the reasoning results within a trustworthy knowledge domain. Extensive
experimental results on 25 real-world inductive KGR datasets demonstrate the
significant superiority of the proposed KRLM\footnote{Our source codes are
available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/KRLM-EA36 in both zero-shot
reasoning and fine-tuning scenarios.

Conclusion: RAGCap-Bench基准有效评估了代理式RAG的中间能力，增强这些中间能力对于提升整体性能至关重要。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates key limitations of Large
Language Models (LLMs)-such as factual errors, outdated knowledge, and
hallucinations-by dynamically retrieving external information. Recent work
extends this paradigm through agentic RAG systems, where LLMs act as agents to
iteratively plan, retrieve, and reason over complex queries. However, these
systems still struggle with challenging multi-hop questions, and their
intermediate reasoning capabilities remain underexplored. To address this, we
propose RAGCap-Bench, a capability-oriented benchmark for fine-grained
evaluation of intermediate tasks in agentic RAG workflows. We analyze outputs
from state-of-the-art systems to identify common tasks and the core
capabilities required for their execution, then construct a taxonomy of typical
LLM errors to design targeted evaluation questions. Experiments show that
"slow-thinking" models with stronger RAGCap performance achieve better
end-to-end results, underscoring the benchmark's validity and the importance of
enhancing these intermediate capabilities.

TL;DR: 本文研究AI辩论中的模型行为，发现在主观问题上，模型倾向于迎合法官立场而非坚持自身先验信念，顺序辩论存在显著偏见，且与先验信念不一致的论点反而被评价为质量更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI辩论研究依赖有标准答案的数据集，忽略了主观维度。本文旨在探究在主观问题上，语言模型是否会为了说服力而迎合法官立场，还是坚持自身先验信念。

Method: 测量语言模型的先验信念，设置与模型先验冲突的法官角色，比较顺序和同步两种辩论协议，评估模型在不同立场下的说服力和论点质量。

Result: 模型倾向于迎合法官立场而非坚持先验信念；顺序辩论对第二位辩手有利；模型在先验信念一致的立场上更具说服力；但与先验不一致的论点在成对比较中质量评分更高。

Conclusion: 这些发现有助于人类法官提供更高质量的训练信号，促进更对齐的AI系统，同时揭示了语言模型中说服动态的重要方面。

Abstract: The core premise of AI debate as a scalable oversight technique is that it is
harder to lie convincingly than to refute a lie, enabling the judge to identify
the correct position. Yet, existing debate experiments have relied on datasets
with ground truth, where lying is reduced to defending an incorrect
proposition. This overlooks a subjective dimension: lying also requires the
belief that the claim defended is false. In this work, we apply debate to
subjective questions and explicitly measure large language models' prior
beliefs before experiments. Debaters were asked to select their preferred
position, then presented with a judge persona deliberately designed to conflict
with their identified priors. This setup tested whether models would adopt
sycophantic strategies, aligning with the judge's presumed perspective to
maximize persuasiveness, or remain faithful to their prior beliefs. We
implemented and compared two debate protocols, sequential and simultaneous, to
evaluate potential systematic biases. Finally, we assessed whether models were
more persuasive and produced higher-quality arguments when defending positions
consistent with their prior beliefs versus when arguing against them. Our main
findings show that models tend to prefer defending stances aligned with the
judge persona rather than their prior beliefs, sequential debate introduces
significant bias favoring the second debater, models are more persuasive when
defending positions aligned with their prior beliefs, and paradoxically,
arguments misaligned with prior beliefs are rated as higher quality in pairwise
comparison. These results can inform human judges to provide higher-quality
training signals and contribute to more aligned AI systems, while revealing
important aspects of human-AI interaction regarding persuasion dynamics in
language models.

Motivation: 现有的深度研究代理在处理复杂问答任务时面临挑战，因为语言模型通常未针对长程推理和探索进行优化。现有方法生成的数据缺乏对难度和质量的细粒度控制，且难以评估数据本身的有效性。

Method: 采用两阶段数据合成管道，逐步增加任务复杂度直到基线网络代理失败。基线代理负责尝试问题、验证事实性、检查替代答案和执行过滤。使用基于强网络代理蒸馏的受控训练设置来评估合成方法的有效性。

Result: 实验表明，尽管数据集较小，但训练出的网络代理在多个网络基准测试中表现优于现有数据集。数据在工具使用动作上展现出两倍的多样性，使模型能够获得更强的性能，同时避免重复的工具调用行为。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成高质量的训练数据，有效提升网络代理在复杂问答任务中的表现，特别是在长程推理和工具使用多样性方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Web-based 'deep research' agents aim to solve complex question - answering
tasks through long-horizon interactions with online tools. These tasks remain
challenging, as the underlying language models are often not optimized for
long-horizon reasoning and exploration. Prior work has proposed workflows for
constructing instruction-tuning datasets, often leveraging knowledge graphs.
However, such methods typically lack fine-grained control over difficulty and
quality, yielding synthetic data that falls short of capturing the complexity
required for long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore, many studies conflate data
and training effects by comparing models trained under different optimization
recipes, making it difficult to isolate and evaluate the effectiveness of the
data itself. We introduce a two-pronged data synthesis pipeline that generates
question - answer pairs by progressively increasing task complexity until a
frontier baseline web agent fails. The baseline agent plays multiple roles in
this process: attempting the questions, validating factuality, checking for
alternative answers, and enforcing filtering. To evaluate the effectiveness of
our synthesis methods, we adopt a controlled training setup based on
distillation from strong web agents. Experiments across multiple web-based
benchmarks show that our dataset - despite being smaller - enables the training
of more effective web agents than existing datasets. In particular, our data
exhibits twice the diversity in tool-use actions, allowing models trained on it
to achieve stronger performance while avoiding repetitive tool-calling
behaviors.

### [149] [Readability $\ne$ Learnability: Rethinking the Role of Simplicity in Training Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13915)
*Ivan Lee,Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文挑战了可读性在小语言模型能力涌现中起关键作用的观点，发现统计简单性（n-gram多样性）才是更强的可学习性预测指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反驳当前将小语言模型训练与人类认知发展进行类比的趋势，质疑可读性在模型能力涌现中的核心作用，强调需要更精确地理解支持小模型能力出现的实际属性。

Method: 构建具有匹配结构但可读性不同的合成数据集，比较小语言模型在不同可读性文本上的训练表现，分析统计简单性（n-gram多样性）与学习效率的关系。

Result: 在复杂成人级文本上训练的模型与简化语言训练的模型表现相当，甚至在训练过程中更快发展出连贯性，可读性本身并不能预测模型的连贯性或学习效率。

Conclusion: 统计简单性比可读性更能预测小语言模型的可学习性，警告不要在没有实证基础的情况下将语言模型训练与人类认知发展进行类比。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that very small language models (SLMs) can generate
surprisingly coherent text when trained on simplified, child-directed corpora
such as TinyStories. These findings have been interpreted as evidence that
readability -- characterized by accessible vocabulary, familiar narrative
structure, and simple syntax -- plays a key role in enabling such capabilities
to emerge. In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. We construct
synthetic datasets with matched structure but varied readability, and find that
readability alone does not predict coherence or learning efficiency in SLMs.
Models trained on complex, adult-level text perform comparably to those trained
on simplified language, and even exhibit faster development of coherence during
training. Instead, we show that statistical simplicity, as measured by n-gram
diversity, is a stronger predictor of learnability. Our findings caution
against the growing trend of anthropomorphizing language model training --
drawing parallels to human cognitive development without empirical basis -- and
argue for more precise reasoning about what properties actually support
capability emergence in small models.

TL;DR: 提出Element2Vec方法，通过语言模型从维基百科文本生成化学元素的通用嵌入和属性突出向量，解决传统数值分析方法难以建模复杂关系的问题，并设计基于自注意力的测试时训练方法来缓解预测误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 化学元素的准确属性数据对材料设计和制造至关重要，但许多属性因设备限制难以直接测量。传统数值分析方法无法有效建模复杂关系，且现有AI方法存在幻觉和缺乏可解释性问题。

Method: 使用语言模型从维基百科文本生成化学元素的通用嵌入(Global)和属性突出向量(Local)，并设计基于自注意力的测试时训练方法来缓解预测误差。

Result: 该方法能够有效表示化学元素，支持自然科学研究，特别是在数据稀疏和分布差异的挑战下仍能保持良好性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作为推进材料科学中AI驱动发现铺平了道路，通过文本驱动的元素表示方法解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Accurate property data for chemical elements is crucial for materials design
and manufacturing, but many of them are difficult to measure directly due to
equipment constraints. While traditional methods use the properties of other
elements or related properties for prediction via numerical analyses, they
often fail to model complex relationships. After all, not all characteristics
can be represented as scalars. Recent efforts have been made to explore
advanced AI tools such as language models for property estimation, but they
still suffer from hallucinations and a lack of interpretability. In this paper,
we investigate Element2Vecto effectively represent chemical elements from
natural languages to support research in the natural sciences. Given the text
parsed from Wikipedia pages, we use language models to generate both a single
general-purpose embedding (Global) and a set of attribute-highlighted vectors
(Local). Despite the complicated relationship across elements, the
computational challenges also exist because of 1) the discrepancy in text
distribution between common descriptions and specialized scientific texts, and
2) the extremely limited data, i.e., with only 118 known elements, data for
specific properties is often highly sparse and incomplete. Thus, we also design
a test-time training method based on self-attention to mitigate the prediction
error caused by Vanilla regression clearly. We hope this work could pave the
way for advancing AI-driven discovery in materials science.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种优化过程奖励模型(PRM)在测试时扩展(TTS)中使用的理论框架和校准方法，通过智能聚合策略显著提升效率，仅需21.3%的计算量即可超越传统加权多数投票。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PRM在测试时扩展中表现不佳，有时甚至被简单的多数投票超越，需要找到更有效利用PRM验证信号的方法。

Method: 开发理论框架分析LLM和PRM信号的最优组合策略，提出高效的预计算校准方法来估计最优权重函数。

Result: 在5个LLM和7个PRM上的广泛实验表明，校准方法显著提升TTS效率，仅用21.3%计算量就超越传统加权多数投票。

Conclusion: 投资更智能的聚合策略比单纯扩展测试时计算更能获得性能提升，为TTS提供了更有效的路径。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) are a cornerstone of test-time scaling (TTS),
designed to verify and select the best responses from large language models
(LLMs). However, this promise is challenged by recent benchmarks where simple
majority voting, which ignores PRM signals, occasionally outperforms standard
PRM-based selection. This raises a critical question: How can we effectively
utilize verification signals from PRMs for TTS? To address this, we start by
developing a theoretical framework for optimally combining signals from both
the LLM and the PRM. Our framework reveals that the optimal strategy is a
weighted aggregation of responses, a strategy whose effectiveness hinges on
estimating weights that capture the complex interplay between the models. Based
on our theoretical results, we empirically show that these optimal weighting
functions differ significantly across LLM-PRM pairs and, notably, often assign
substantial negative weights. Motivated by these insights, we propose efficient
pre-computation methods to calibrate these weighting functions. Extensive
experiments across 5 LLMs and 7 PRMs demonstrate that our calibration method
significantly boosts the TTS efficiency, surpassing the performance of vanilla
weighted majority voting while using only $21.3\%$ of the computation.
Ultimately, our work demonstrates that investing in a more intelligent
aggregation strategy can be a more convincing path to performance gains than
simply scaling test-time computation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FACTS是一个快速、准确且隐私合规的表格摘要方法，通过离线模板生成实现查询导向的表格摘要，解决了现有方法在成本、推理能力、效率和隐私方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格摘要方法面临关键限制：表格到文本模型需要昂贵的微调且难以处理复杂推理，基于提示的LLM方法存在token限制和效率问题并暴露敏感数据，而先前的代理流程依赖缺乏鲁棒性和可扩展性的分解、规划或手动模板。

Method: FACTS通过离线生成包含SQL查询和Jinja2模板的模板，这些模板可以在共享相同模式的多个表格中重复使用，渲染成自然语言摘要。该方法仅向LLM发送表格模式以确保隐私合规。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中，FACTS始终优于基线方法，证明了其作为实际查询导向表格摘要解决方案的有效性。

Conclusion: FACTS通过可重用的离线模板实现快速摘要，通过可执行的SQL查询确保准确性，并通过仅发送表格模式到LLM来保证隐私合规，为现实世界的查询导向表格摘要提供了一个实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Query-focused table summarization requires generating natural language
summaries of tabular data conditioned on a user query, enabling users to access
insights beyond fact retrieval. Existing approaches face key limitations:
table-to-text models require costly fine-tuning and struggle with complex
reasoning, prompt-based LLM methods suffer from token-limit and efficiency
issues while exposing sensitive data, and prior agentic pipelines often rely on
decomposition, planning, or manual templates that lack robustness and
scalability. To mitigate these issues, we introduce an agentic workflow, FACTS,
a Fast, Accurate, and Privacy-Compliant Table Summarization approach via
Offline Template Generation. FACTS produces offline templates, consisting of
SQL queries and Jinja2 templates, which can be rendered into natural language
summaries and are reusable across multiple tables sharing the same schema. It
enables fast summarization through reusable offline templates, accurate outputs
with executable SQL queries, and privacy compliance by sending only table
schemas to LLMs. Evaluations on widely-used benchmarks show that FACTS
consistently outperforms baseline methods, establishing it as a practical
solution for real-world query-focused table summarization.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于LLM的AI代理框架，将原始数据包捕获转换为结构化语义表示，用于物联网网络流量的交互式分析，通过混合检索方法显著提升分析效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网网络产生多样且高流量的流量，需要跨层解释行为、协议和上下文，而不是孤立的检测，以从遥测数据中获得有意义的洞察。

Method: 集成特征提取、基于transformer的异常检测、数据包和流摘要、威胁情报增强以及检索增强问答的AI代理框架，使用大语言模型对索引的流量工件进行推理。

Result: 在多个物联网捕获和六个开放模型上的实验评估显示，结合词汇和语义搜索与重新排序的混合检索方法，相比仅密集检索，显著提升了BLEU、ROUGE、METEOR和BERTScore结果。系统分析表明CPU、GPU和内存开销较低。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了对物联网网络流量的全面高效解释，通过AI代理和混合检索方法有效提升了流量分析的准确性和可读性。

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) networks generate diverse and high-volume traffic
that reflects both normal activity and potential threats. Deriving meaningful
insight from such telemetry requires cross-layer interpretation of behaviors,
protocols, and context rather than isolated detection. This work presents an
LLM-powered AI agent framework that converts raw packet captures into
structured and semantically enriched representations for interactive analysis.
The framework integrates feature extraction, transformer-based anomaly
detection, packet and flow summarization, threat intelligence enrichment, and
retrieval-augmented question answering. An AI agent guided by a large language
model performs reasoning over the indexed traffic artifacts, assembling
evidence to produce accurate and human-readable interpretations. Experimental
evaluation on multiple IoT captures and six open models shows that hybrid
retrieval, which combines lexical and semantic search with reranking,
substantially improves BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore results compared with
dense-only retrieval. System profiling further indicates low CPU, GPU, and
memory overhead, demonstrating that the framework achieves holistic and
efficient interpretation of IoT network traffic.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BioMedSearch是一个基于大语言模型的多源生物医学信息检索框架，通过整合文献检索、蛋白质数据库和网络搜索，结合子查询分解、关键词提取、任务图构建和多源信息过滤，显著提升了复杂生物医学问答的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在生物医学领域生成的内容缺乏科学严谨性，无法访问权威生物医学数据库，经常虚构蛋白质功能和结构细节。需要开发能够整合多源权威信息的框架来支持准确的生物医学检索和推理。

Method: 提出BioMedSearch框架，整合文献检索、蛋白质数据库和网络搜索，通过子查询分解、关键词提取、任务图构建和多源信息过滤等技术处理复杂生物医学查询。

Result: 在构建的BioMedMCQs数据集（3000个问题）上测试，BioMedSearch在所有推理级别上都显著优于基线模型：Level 1准确率从59.1%提升到91.9%；Level 2从47.0%提升到81.0%；Level 3从36.3%提升到73.4%。

Conclusion: BioMedSearch框架通过多源信息整合和结构化处理，有效解决了大语言模型在生物医学领域的科学严谨性问题，显著提升了复杂生物医学问答的准确性。

Abstract: Biomedical queries often rely on a deep understanding of specialized
knowledge such as gene regulatory mechanisms and pathological processes of
diseases. They require detailed analysis of complex physiological processes and
effective integration of information from multiple data sources to support
accurate retrieval and reasoning. Although large language models (LLMs) perform
well in general reasoning tasks, their generated biomedical content often lacks
scientific rigor due to the inability to access authoritative biomedical
databases and frequently fabricates protein functions, interactions, and
structural details that deviate from authentic information. Therefore, we
present BioMedSearch, a multi-source biomedical information retrieval framework
based on LLMs. The method integrates literature retrieval, protein database and
web search access to support accurate and efficient handling of complex
biomedical queries. Through sub-queries decomposition, keywords extraction,
task graph construction, and multi-source information filtering, BioMedSearch
generates high-quality question-answering results. To evaluate the accuracy of
question answering, we constructed a multi-level dataset, BioMedMCQs,
consisting of 3,000 questions. The dataset covers three levels of reasoning:
mechanistic identification, non-adjacent semantic integration, and temporal
causal reasoning, and is used to assess the performance of BioMedSearch and
other methods on complex QA tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that
BioMedSearch consistently improves accuracy over all baseline models across all
levels. Specifically, at Level 1, the average accuracy increases from 59.1% to
91.9%; at Level 2, it rises from 47.0% to 81.0%; and at the most challenging
Level 3, the average accuracy improves from 36.3% to 73.4%. The code and
BioMedMCQs are available at: https://github.com/CyL-ucas/BioMed_Search

TL;DR: LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis：持续接触垃圾网络文本会导致大语言模型认知能力下降。通过控制实验发现，在垃圾数据集上持续预训练会显著损害模型的推理、长文本理解、安全性等能力，并增强负面人格特质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究数据质量对LLM认知能力的影响，验证垃圾网络文本是否会导致模型能力退化，为持续预训练的数据筛选提供安全指导。

Method: 使用Twitter/X语料构建垃圾和控制数据集，通过两种正交操作化方法（M1：参与度，M2：语义质量）进行控制实验，在4个LLM上进行持续预训练对比。

Result: 垃圾数据训练导致推理能力显著下降（ARC-Challenge从74.9降至57.2），长文本理解能力下降（RULER-CWE从84.4降至52.3），安全性降低，负面人格特质增强。思维跳跃是主要错误机制。

Conclusion: 数据质量是LLM能力退化的因果驱动因素，需要将持续预训练的数据筛选视为训练时安全问题，并定期对部署的LLM进行认知健康检查。

Abstract: We propose and test the LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis: continual exposure to junk
web text induces lasting cognitive decline in large language models (LLMs). To
causally isolate data quality, we run controlled experiments on real Twitter/X
corpora, constructing junk and reversely controlled datasets via two orthogonal
operationalizations: M1 (engagement degree) and M2 (semantic quality), with
matched token scale and training operations across conditions. Contrary to the
control group, continual pre-training of 4 LLMs on the junk dataset causes
non-trivial declines (Hedges' $g>0.3$) on reasoning, long-context
understanding, safety, and inflating "dark traits" (e.g., psychopathy,
narcissism). The gradual mixtures of junk and control datasets also yield
dose-response cognition decay: for example, under M1, ARC-Challenge with Chain
Of Thoughts drops $74.9 \rightarrow 57.2$ and RULER-CWE $84.4 \rightarrow 52.3$
as junk ratio rises from $0\%$ to $100\%$.
  Error forensics reveal several key insights. First, we identify
thought-skipping as the primary lesion: models increasingly truncate or skip
reasoning chains, explaining most of the error growth. Second, partial but
incomplete healing is observed: scaling instruction tuning and clean data
pre-training improve the declined cognition yet cannot restore baseline
capability, suggesting persistent representational drift rather than format
mismatch. Finally, we discover that the popularity, a non-semantic metric, of a
tweet is a better indicator of the Brain Rot effect than the length in M1.
Together, the results provide significant, multi-perspective evidence that data
quality is a causal driver of LLM capability decay, reframing curation for
continual pretraining as a \textit{training-time safety} problem and motivating
routine "cognitive health checks" for deployed LLMs.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在药物安全预测中是否纳入临床无关的社会人口学信息，评估其在真实世界部署中的可靠性。

Method: 使用FAERS结构化数据和基于角色的评估框架，测试ChatGPT-4o和Bio-Medical-Llama-3.8B模型在不同社会人口学特征和用户角色下的表现。

Result: 发现系统性预测准确性差异，弱势群体被分配更高的不良事件预测概率，识别出显性偏见和隐性偏见两种模式。

Conclusion: LLMs在药物警戒应用中存在严重风险，临床部署前迫切需要公平性评估协议和缓解策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in biomedical domains,
yet their reliability in drug-safety prediction remains underexplored. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs incorporate socio-demographic information
into adverse event (AE) predictions, despite such attributes being clinically
irrelevant. Using structured data from the United States Food and Drug
Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and a persona-based
evaluation framework, we assess two state-of-the-art models, ChatGPT-4o and
Bio-Medical-Llama-3.8B, across diverse personas defined by education, marital
status, employment, insurance, language, housing stability, and religion. We
further evaluate performance across three user roles (general practitioner,
specialist, patient) to reflect real-world deployment scenarios where
commercial systems often differentiate access by user type. Our results reveal
systematic disparities in AE prediction accuracy. Disadvantaged groups (e.g.,
low education, unstable housing) were frequently assigned higher predicted AE
likelihoods than more privileged groups (e.g., postgraduate-educated, privately
insured). Beyond outcome disparities, we identify two distinct modes of bias:
explicit bias, where incorrect predictions directly reference persona
attributes in reasoning traces, and implicit bias, where predictions are
inconsistent, yet personas are not explicitly mentioned. These findings expose
critical risks in applying LLMs to pharmacovigilance and highlight the urgent
need for fairness-aware evaluation protocols and mitigation strategies before
clinical deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型虽然能在本地硬件高效运行，具有隐私保护、低成本等优势，但在需要多步推理或领域知识的任务上表现不佳。

Method: 构建指令语料库：将相似训练问题分组，通过GPT-5生成指令。推理时，SLM检索最相关指令并遵循其步骤进行推理。

Result: 在MedQA上提升9.4%，MMLU法律上提升7.9%，MathQA上提升5.1%。简洁指令优于长指令，改进幅度取决于模型家族和内在推理能力。

Conclusion: 指令检索为小型语言模型提供了有效的推理增强方法，无需额外训练即可显著提升复杂任务表现。

Abstract: Can we bring large-scale reasoning to local-scale compute? Small language
models (SLMs) are increasingly attractive because they run efficiently on local
hardware, offering strong privacy, low cost, and reduced environmental impact.
Yet they often struggle with tasks that require multi-step reasoning or
domain-specific knowledge. We address this limitation through instruction
intervention at inference time, where an SLM retrieves structured reasoning
procedures rather than generating them from scratch. Our method builds an
Instruction Corpus by grouping similar training questions and creating
instructions via GPT-5. During inference, the SLM retrieves the most relevant
instructions and follows their steps. Unlike retrieval-augmented generation,
which retrieves text passages, instruction retrieval gives the model structured
guidance for reasoning. We evaluate this framework on MedQA (medical board
exams), MMLU Professional Law, and MathQA using models from 3B to 14B
parameters without any additional fine-tuning. Instruction retrieval yields
consistent gains: 9.4% on MedQA, 7.9% on MMLU Law, and 5.1% on MathQA. Concise
instructions outperform longer ones, and the magnitude of improvement depends
strongly on model family and intrinsic reasoning ability.

Abstract: Deep Research (DR) agents, powered by advanced Large Language Models (LLMs),
have recently garnered increasing attention for their capability in conducting
complex research tasks. However, existing literature lacks a rigorous and
systematic evaluation of DR Agent's capabilities in critical research analysis.
To address this gap, we first propose HisRubric, a novel evaluation framework
with a hierarchical analytical structure and a fine-grained grading rubric for
rigorously assessing DR agents' capabilities in corporate financial analysis.
This framework mirrors the professional analyst's workflow, progressing from
data recognition to metric calculation, and finally to strategic summarization
and interpretation. Built on this framework, we construct a FinDeepResearch
benchmark that comprises 64 listed companies from 8 financial markets across 4
languages, encompassing a total of 15,808 grading items. We further conduct
extensive experiments on the FinDeepResearch using 16 representative methods,
including 6 DR agents, 5 LLMs equipped with both deep reasoning and search
capabilities, and 5 LLMs with deep reasoning capabilities only. The results
reveal the strengths and limitations of these approaches across diverse
capabilities, financial markets, and languages, offering valuable insights for
future research and development. The benchmark and evaluation code will be made
publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI模型是否能够生成高质量文学作品并模仿作者风格，以回应关于AI使用受版权保护作品训练模型的争议。

Method: 进行预注册研究，比较MFA专业作家与三个前沿AI模型（ChatGPT、Claude、Gemini）在模仿50位获奖作家风格方面的表现，通过159名专家和普通读者的盲测评估。

Result: 上下文提示生成的AI文本被专家强烈否定，但经过微调的AI文本在风格保真度和写作质量上均优于人类专家写作，且很少被AI检测器识别。

Conclusion: 作者特定的微调使AI能够生成读者偏好超过人类专家写作的非逐字作品，成本降低99.7%，为版权合理使用的第四因素提供了实证证据。

Abstract: The use of copyrighted books for training AI models has led to numerous
lawsuits from authors concerned about AI's ability to generate derivative
content.Yet it's unclear whether these models can generate high quality
literary text while emulating authors' styles. To answer this we conducted a
preregistered study comparing MFA-trained expert writers with three frontier AI
models: ChatGPT, Claude & Gemini in writing up to 450 word excerpts emulating
50 award-winning authors' diverse styles. In blind pairwise evaluations by 159
representative expert & lay readers, AI-generated text from in-context
prompting was strongly disfavored by experts for both stylistic fidelity
(OR=0.16, p<10^8) & writing quality (OR=0.13, p<10^7) but showed mixed results
with lay readers. However, fine-tuning ChatGPT on individual authors' complete
works completely reversed these findings: experts now favored AI-generated text
for stylistic fidelity (OR=8.16, p<10^13) & writing quality (OR=1.87, p=0.010),
with lay readers showing similar shifts. These effects generalize across
authors & styles. The fine-tuned outputs were rarely flagged as AI-generated
(3% rate v. 97% for in-context prompting) by best AI detectors. Mediation
analysis shows this reversal occurs because fine-tuning eliminates detectable
AI stylistic quirks (e.g., cliche density) that penalize in-context outputs.
While we do not account for additional costs of human effort required to
transform raw AI output into cohesive, publishable prose, the median
fine-tuning & inference cost of $81 per author represents a dramatic 99.7%
reduction compared to typical professional writer compensation. Author-specific
fine-tuning thus enables non-verbatim AI writing that readers prefer to expert
human writing, providing empirical evidence directly relevant to copyright's
fourth fair-use factor, the "effect upon the potential market or value" of the
source works.

Conclusion: MTI证明了通过局部化干预策略可以在保持效率的同时显著提升LLM的推理性能。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has focused on test-time
scaling to improve reasoning via increased inference computation, but often at
the cost of efficiency. We revisit test-time behavior and uncover a simple yet
underexplored phenomenon: reasoning uncertainty is highly localized-only a
small subset of high-entropy tokens dominantly affects output correctness.
Motivated by this, we propose Minimal Test-Time Intervention (MTI), a
training-free framework that enhances reasoning accuracy and stability with
minimal overhead. MTI includes: (i) Selective CFG intervention, applying
classifier-free guidance only at uncertain positions; and (ii) Lightweight
negative-prompt guidance, reusing the main model's KV cache to approximate
unconditional decoding efficiently. MTI yields consistent gains across general,
coding, and STEM tasks-e.g., +1.35% average improvement on eight benchmarks for
Qwen3-8B-Base and +5% on AIME2024 using Qwen3-32B-Reasoning-while remaining
highly efficient.

Motivation: 由于现实世界RAG系统的复杂性，存在许多导致错误输出的潜在原因。理解实践中可能发生的错误范围对于稳健部署至关重要。

Method: 提出了新的错误类型分类法，策划了带错误类型标注的RAG响应数据集，并开发了与分类法一致的自动评估方法。

Result: 建立了全面的RAG错误分类体系，提供了实际错误示例和解决建议，创建了标注数据集和可操作的评估工具。

Conclusion: 该工作为RAG系统的错误分析和改进提供了系统化的框架和实用工具，有助于提升RAG系统的可靠性和部署质量。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a prevalent approach for building
LLM-based question-answering systems that can take advantage of external
knowledge databases. Due to the complexity of real-world RAG systems, there are
many potential causes for erroneous outputs. Understanding the range of errors
that can occur in practice is crucial for robust deployment. We present a new
taxonomy of the error types that can occur in realistic RAG systems, examples
of each, and practical advice for addressing them. Additionally, we curate a
dataset of erroneous RAG responses annotated by error types. We then propose an
auto-evaluation method aligned with our taxonomy that can be used in practice
to track and address errors during development. Code and data are available at
https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/rag-error-classification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: German Commons是迄今为止最大的开放许可德语文本集合，包含1545.6亿token的高质量文本，涵盖法律、科学、文化等7个领域，解决了德语预训练数据缺乏的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大规模语言模型开发依赖训练语料库，但大多数数据许可状态不明确，限制了真正开放模型的发展。对于非英语语言，特别是德语，开放许可文本严重稀缺。

Method: 从41个来源系统收集数据，实施全面的质量过滤、去重和文本格式修复处理流程，确保异构文本源的质量一致性。所有子集至少采用CC-BY-SA 4.0或等效许可证。

Result: 构建了包含154.56亿token的高质量德语文本语料库，涵盖7个领域，确保法律合规性，支持模型训练和再分发。

Conclusion: German Commons填补了德语预训练数据的空白，促进了真正开放德语语言模型的开发，同时发布了语料构建和数据过滤代码，确保完全可复现和可扩展。

Abstract: Large language model development relies on large-scale training corpora, yet
most contain data of unclear licensing status, limiting the development of
truly open models. This problem is exacerbated for non-English languages, where
openly licensed text remains critically scarce. We introduce the German
Commons, the largest collection of openly licensed German text to date. It
compiles data from 41 sources across seven domains, encompassing legal,
scientific, cultural, political, news, economic, and web text. Through
systematic sourcing from established data providers with verifiable licensing,
it yields 154.56 billion tokens of high-quality text for language model
training. Our processing pipeline implements comprehensive quality filtering,
deduplication, and text formatting fixes, ensuring consistent quality across
heterogeneous text sources. All domain subsets feature licenses of at least
CC-BY-SA 4.0 or equivalent, ensuring legal compliance for model training and
redistribution. The German Commons therefore addresses the critical gap in
openly licensed German pretraining data, and enables the development of truly
open German language models. We also release code for corpus construction and
data filtering tailored to German language text, rendering the German Commons
fully reproducible and extensible.

### [163] [CRaFT: An Explanation-Based Framework for Evaluating Cultural Reasoning in Multilingual Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14014)
*Shehenaz Hossain,Haithem Afli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CRaFT是一个基于解释的多语言评估框架，用于评估大语言模型在跨文化语境中的推理能力，通过四个可解释指标分析模型解释而非仅依赖答案准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 正确回答不一定反映文化理解，需要评估LLMs在跨文化语境中的推理能力，而不仅仅是答案准确性。

Method: 使用CRaFT框架评估三个模型（GPT、DeepSeek、FANAR）在50个来自世界价值观调查的文化基础问题上的表现，这些问题被翻译成阿拉伯语、孟加拉语和西班牙语，分析了2100多个答案-解释对。

Result: 结果显示显著的跨语言推理差异：阿拉伯语降低流畅性，孟加拉语增强流畅性，西班牙语保持稳定。GPT跨语言适应更好但一致性较低，FANAR推理稳定但僵化。

Conclusion: LLMs的文化意识不是固有的，而是通过语言框架显现的。CRaFT为评估多语言环境中的跨文化推理提供了新视角，为构建文化适应性语言模型提供了可行见解。

Abstract: Correct answers do not necessarily reflect cultural understanding. We
introduce CRaFT, an explanation-based multilingual evaluation framework
designed to assess how large language models (LLMs) reason across cultural
contexts. Rather than scoring outputs solely based on accuracy, CRaFT evaluates
model explanations using four interpretable metrics: Cultural Fluency,
Deviation, Consistency, and Linguistic Adaptation. We apply the framework to 50
culturally grounded questions from the World Values Survey, translated into
Arabic, Bengali, and Spanish, and evaluate three models (GPT, DeepSeek, and
FANAR) across over 2,100 answer-explanation pairs. Results reveal significant
cross-lingual variation in reasoning: Arabic reduces fluency, Bengali enhances
it, and Spanish remains largely stable. While GPT adapts more effectively
across languages, it exhibits lower consistency; FANAR shows stable but rigid
reasoning. These findings suggest that cultural awareness in LLMs is not
intrinsic but emerges through linguistic framing. CRaFT offers a new lens for
evaluating cross-cultural reasoning in multilingual settings, providing
actionable insights for building culturally adaptive language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型在抽象推理任务中的语言偏见，因为现有研究多关注依赖策略或知识的推理任务，而抽象推理对日常生活至关重要。

Method: 构建了基于纽约时报Connections游戏的GlobalGroup基准，包含英语、西班牙语、中文、印地语和阿拉伯语五种语言背景，并提出了游戏难度测量方法以实现更受控的比较。

Result: 实验发现英语模态在抽象推理任务中表现更好，且开源模型与闭源模型之间存在性能差异。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在抽象推理任务中存在语言偏见，英语模态表现更优，不同模型架构间存在性能差距。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can exhibit biases in reasoning capabilities due
to linguistic modality, performing better on tasks in one language versus
another, even with similar content. Most previous works evaluate this through
reasoning tasks where reliance on strategies or knowledge can ensure success,
such as in commonsense or math tasks. However, abstract reasoning is vital to
reasoning for everyday life, where people apply "out-of-the-box thinking" to
identify and use patterns for solutions, without a reliance on formulaic
approaches. Comparatively, little work has evaluated linguistic biases in this
task type. In this paper, we propose a task inspired by the New York Times
Connections: GlobalGroup, that evaluates models in an abstract reasoning task
across several languages. We constructed a game benchmark with five linguistic
backgrounds -- English, Spanish, Chinese, Hindi, and Arabic -- in both the
native language and an English translation for comparison. We also proposed
game difficulty measurements to evaluate models on games with similar
difficulty, enabling a more controlled comparison, which is particularly
important in reasoning evaluations. Through experimentation, we find English
modalities largely lead to better performance in this abstract reasoning task,
and performance disparities between open- and closed-source models.

Method: 使用分布方法分析6种语言（英语、西班牙语、印地语、芬兰语、土耳其语和泰米尔语）中语素的语音和语义相似性空间的对齐情况，采用统计测量套件。

Result: 发现了一系列文献中未识别过的可解释的语音语义对齐模式，以及跨语言模式；对5种先前假设的语音语义对齐进行了验证，部分得到支持，部分结果复杂。

Conclusion: 语音语义象似性在大规模分布分析中确实存在可检测的模式，包括新的对齐关系和跨语言一致性，但先前假设的某些对齐关系需要更谨慎的解释。

Abstract: Language is, as commonly theorized, largely arbitrary. Yet, systematic
relationships between phonetics and semantics have been observed in many
specific cases. To what degree could those systematic relationships manifest
themselves in large scale, quantitative investigations--both in previously
identified and unidentified phenomena? This work undertakes a distributional
approach to quantifying phonosemantic iconicity at scale across 6 diverse
languages (English, Spanish, Hindi, Finnish, Turkish, and Tamil). In each
language, we analyze the alignment of morphemes' phonetic and semantic
similarity spaces with a suite of statistical measures, and discover an array
of interpretable phonosemantic alignments not previously identified in the
literature, along with crosslinguistic patterns. We also analyze 5 previously
hypothesized phonosemantic alignments, finding support for some such alignments
and mixed results for others.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在多轮对话中性能显著下降，影响实际应用效果

Method: 引入ERGO方法，通过香农熵量化下一个token分布的不确定性，检测熵值突变时触发自适应提示整合

Result: 在增量信息任务中，ERGO相比基线平均性能提升56.6%，峰值能力提升24.7%，不可靠性降低35.3%

Conclusion: 将不确定性作为首要信号而非需要消除的干扰，能够同时提升对话AI的准确性和可靠性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer significant performance degradation in
multi-turn conversations when information is presented incrementally. Given
that multi-turn conversations characterize everyday interactions with LLMs,
this degradation poses a severe challenge to real world usability. We
hypothesize that abrupt increases in model uncertainty signal misalignment in
multi-turn LLM interactions, and we exploit this insight to dynamically realign
conversational context. We introduce ERGO (Entropy-guided Resetting for
Generation Optimization), which continuously quantifies internal uncertainty
via Shannon entropy over next token distributions and triggers adaptive prompt
consolidation when a sharp spike in entropy is detected. By treating
uncertainty as a first class signal rather than a nuisance to eliminate, ERGO
embraces variability in language and modeling, representing and responding to
uncertainty. In multi-turn tasks with incrementally revealed instructions, ERGO
yields a 56.6% average performance gain over standard baselines, increases
aptitude (peak performance capability) by 24.7%, and decreases unreliability
(variability in performance) by 35.3%, demonstrating that uncertainty aware
interventions can improve both accuracy and reliability in conversational AI.

TL;DR: DROID是一个紧凑的端到端框架，结合通用语义编码器和领域特定编码器，使用轻量级分支分类器和单一校准阈值来检测对话系统中的超出范围意图，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测超出范围(OOS)用户话语是任务导向对话系统和开放集意图识别的关键挑战，现有方法依赖强分布假设或辅助校准模块，需要更鲁棒和可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 提出DROID框架，结合通用句子编码器(USE)和领域适应的Transformer去噪自编码器(TSDAE)的双编码器表示，使用轻量级分支分类器和单一校准阈值，并采用合成和开放域异常值增强来加强边界学习。

Result: 仅使用150万可训练参数，DROID在多个意图基准测试中持续优于最新基线方法，已知意图的macro-F1提升6-15%，OOS意图提升8-20%，在低资源设置中收益最显著。

Conclusion: 双编码器表示与简单校准相结合可以为神经对话系统提供鲁棒、可扩展和可靠的OOS检测。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-scope (OOS) user utterances remains a key challenge in
task-oriented dialogue systems and, more broadly, in open-set intent
recognition. Existing approaches often depend on strong distributional
assumptions or auxiliary calibration modules. We present DROID (Dual
Representation for Out-of-Scope Intent Detection), a compact end-to-end
framework that combines two complementary encoders -- the Universal Sentence
Encoder (USE) for broad semantic generalization and a domain-adapted
Transformer-based Denoising Autoencoder (TSDAE) for domain-specific contextual
distinctions. Their fused representations are processed by a lightweight
branched classifier with a single calibrated threshold that separates in-domain
and OOS intents without post-hoc scoring. To enhance boundary learning under
limited supervision, DROID incorporates both synthetic and open-domain outlier
augmentation. Despite using only 1.5M trainable parameters, DROID consistently
outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines across multiple intent
benchmarks, achieving macro-F1 improvements of 6--15% for known and 8--20% for
OOS intents, with the most significant gains in low-resource settings. These
results demonstrate that dual-encoder representations with simple calibration
can yield robust, scalable, and reliable OOS detection for neural dialogue
systems.

Conclusion: CyberPal 2.0证明了小型语言模型在网络安全领域的有效性，能够以更小的模型尺寸实现与前沿大模型相当甚至更好的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming everyday applications, yet
deployment in cybersecurity lags due to a lack of high-quality, domain-specific
models and training datasets. To address this gap, we present CyberPal 2.0, a
family of cybersecurity-expert small language models (SLMs) ranging from 4B-20B

cybersecurity instruction dataset built with our data enrichment and formatting
pipeline, SecKnowledge 2.0, which integrates expert-in-the-loop steering of
reasoning formats alongside LLM-driven multi-step grounding, yielding
higher-fidelity, task-grounded reasoning traces for security tasks. Across
diverse cybersecurity benchmarks, CyberPal 2.0 consistently outperforms its
baselines and matches or surpasses various open and closed-source frontier
models, while remaining a fraction of their size. On core cyber threat

large-scale collections for major languages, Macedonian recipes remain
under-represented in digital research. In this work, we present the first
systematic effort to construct a Macedonian recipe dataset through web scraping

ingredient descriptions, including unit, quantity, and descriptor
normalization. An exploratory analysis of ingredient frequency and
co-occurrence patterns, using measures such as Pointwise Mutual Information and
Lift score, highlights distinctive ingredient combinations that characterize
Macedonian cuisine. The resulting dataset contributes a new resource for
studying food culture in underrepresented languages and offers insights into
the unique patterns of Macedonian culinary tradition.

TL;DR: 提出RLSR方法替代SFT，通过强化学习框架利用SFT数据集提升基础模型的指令遵循能力，在AlpacaEval基准上取得更好表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受RFT启发，希望利用强化学习框架来更有效地利用SFT数据集，改进基础模型的指令遵循能力。

Method: RLSR方法：基础模型为每个提示生成多个响应，在语义嵌入空间中计算生成响应与人工标注响应的余弦相似度作为奖励分数。

Result: RLSR直接替代SFT时，Qwen-7B在AlpacaEval胜率达到26.34%，优于SFT的21.01%；SFT+RLSR组合达到30.73%胜率。

Conclusion: RLSR能有效替代或增强SFT，显著提升模型指令遵循能力，在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Abstract: After the pretraining stage of LLMs, techniques such as SFT, RLHF, RLVR, and
RFT are applied to enhance instruction-following ability, mitigate undesired
responses, improve reasoning capability and enable efficient domain adaptation
with minimal data. SFT relies on the next-token prediction objective to
strengthen instruction following in a base model using a large corpus of
human-labeled responses. In contrast, RFT employs a RL-based approach to adapt
fine-tuned reasoning models to specific domains with limited supervision.
Inspired by RFT, we propose replacing SFT with RLSR to leverage the extensive
SFT dataset in an RL framework, thereby improving the base model's
instruction-following ability. In RLSR, the base model generates multiple
responses for each prompt, and reward scores are computed as the cosine
similarity in the semantic embedding space between the generated and
human-labeled responses. RLSR can be utilized in multiple ways. It can directly
replace SFT, achieving superior performance on instruction-following
benchmarks-for example, RLSR (SB) on Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved an AlpacaEval
win rate of 26.34%, surpassing SFT's 21.01%. Furthermore, combining SFT and
RLSR further enhances downstream task performance; Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved
a win rate of 30.73% when trained with SFT + RLSR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM角色扮演代理的角色保真度常因手动创建的角色配置文件(如精选信息和个性特征)而受损，缺乏与目标个体对齐的验证。

Method: DPRF框架通过自由形式或理论基础的认知差异分析，迭代识别生成行为与人类真实行为之间的差异，并相应优化角色配置文件。

Result: 在四个不同行为预测场景(正式辩论、社交媒体帖子、公开访谈、电影评论)上评估，DPRF相比基线角色配置能持续显著改善行为对齐，且在不同模型和场景间具有良好泛化性。

Conclusion: 该工作为创建高保真角色配置文件和增强下游应用(如用户模拟、社会研究、个性化AI)的有效性提供了稳健的方法论。

Abstract: The emerging large language model role-playing agents (LLM RPAs) aim to
simulate individual human behaviors, but the persona fidelity is often
undermined by manually-created profiles (e.g., cherry-picked information and
personality characteristics) without validating the alignment with the target
individuals. To address this limitation, our work introduces the Dynamic
Persona Refinement Framework (DPRF).DPRF aims to optimize the alignment of LLM
RPAs' behaviors with those of target individuals by iteratively identifying the
cognitive divergence, either through free-form or theory-grounded, structured
analysis, between generated behaviors and human ground truth, and refining the
persona profile to mitigate these divergences.We evaluate DPRF with five LLMs
on four diverse behavior-prediction scenarios: formal debates, social media
posts with mental health issues, public interviews, and movie reviews.DPRF can
consistently improve behavioral alignment considerably over baseline personas
and generalizes across models and scenarios.Our work provides a robust
methodology for creating high-fidelity persona profiles and enhancing the
validity of downstream applications, such as user simulation, social studies,
and personalized AI.

TL;DR: LiteStage是一个针对多阶段推理的延迟感知层跳过框架，通过阶段化离线搜索分配最优层预算，结合在线置信度生成早期退出机制，在三个基准测试上实现最高1.70倍加速，准确率损失小于4.0%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多阶段推理虽然能增强小语言模型的推理能力，但会增加延迟。现有的自适应加速技术（如层跳过）由于两个关键挑战而难以平衡效率和准确性：(1) 阶段间跳过敏感度差异；(2) 冗余输出令牌的生成。

Method: 提出LiteStage框架，结合阶段化离线搜索分配最优层预算，以及在线置信度生成早期退出机制来抑制不必要的解码。

Result: 在OBQA、CSQA和StrategyQA三个基准测试上，LiteStage实现了最高1.70倍的加速，准确率损失小于4.0%，优于先前的无训练层跳过方法。

Conclusion: LiteStage有效解决了多阶段推理中的延迟问题，通过智能的层跳过策略在保持准确性的同时显著提升推理效率。

Abstract: Multi-stage reasoning has emerged as an effective strategy for enhancing the
reasoning capability of small language models by decomposing complex problems
into sequential sub-stages. However, this comes at the cost of increased
latency. We observe that existing adaptive acceleration techniques, such as
layer skipping, struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy in this setting due
to two key challenges: (1) stage-wise variation in skip sensitivity, and (2)
the generation of redundant output tokens. To address these, we propose
LiteStage, a latency-aware layer skipping framework for multi-stage reasoning.
LiteStage combines a stage-wise offline search that allocates optimal layer
budgets with an online confidence-based generation early exit to suppress
unnecessary decoding. Experiments on three benchmarks, e.g., OBQA, CSQA, and
StrategyQA, show that LiteStage achieves up to 1.70x speedup with less than
4.0% accuracy loss, outperforming prior training-free layer skipping methods.

TL;DR: 提出Flip-Flop Consistency (F²C)无监督训练方法，通过共识交叉熵和表示对齐损失来提高LLM对提示扰动的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在面对相同提示的不同表述时经常产生不一致的答案，需要提高模型对提示扰动的鲁棒性。

Method: F²C包含两个关键组件：共识交叉熵(CCE)使用多数投票创建硬伪标签；表示对齐损失将低置信度和非多数预测器拉向共识。

Result: 在11个数据集上测试，平均提高观察一致性11.62%，提升平均F1分数8.94%，减少性能方差3.29%。在域外评估中也表现良好。

Conclusion: F²C是提高LLM在提示扰动下一致性、性能和泛化能力的有效无监督方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce inconsistent answers when faced
with different phrasings of the same prompt. In this paper, we propose
Flip-Flop Consistency ($F^2C$), an unsupervised training method that improves
robustness to such perturbations. $F^2C$ is composed of two key components. The
first, Consensus Cross-Entropy (CCE), uses a majority vote across prompt
variations to create a hard pseudo-label. The second is a representation
alignment loss that pulls lower-confidence and non-majority predictors toward
the consensus established by high-confidence, majority-voting variations. We
evaluate our method on 11 datasets spanning four NLP tasks, with 4-15 prompt
variations per dataset. On average, $F^2C$ raises observed agreement by 11.62%,
improves mean $F_1$ by 8.94%, and reduces performance variance across formats
by 3.29%. In out-of-domain evaluations, $F^2C$ generalizes effectively,
increasing $\overline{F_1}$ and agreement while decreasing variance across most
source-target pairs. Finally, when trained on only a subset of prompt
perturbations and evaluated on held-out formats, $F^2C$ consistently improves
both performance and agreement while reducing variance. These findings
highlight $F^2C$ as an effective unsupervised method for enhancing LLM
consistency, performance, and generalization under prompt perturbations. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG范式在理解相关文本块时限制了知识内化的深度和推理能力，需要转向更主动的文档理解方式。

Method: 提出MoM框架，使用LLMs模拟领域专家生成文档逻辑大纲，指导结构化分块和核心内容提取；采用多路径采样和多视角评估机制；结合反向推理策略训练SLMs；开发三层文档记忆检索机制。

Result: 在三个不同领域的广泛实验表明，MoM框架解决了现有RAG系统的文本分块挑战，为LLMs提供语义完整的文档记忆，并为SLMs实现以人为中心的智能文本处理铺平道路。

Conclusion: MoM框架不仅提升了RAG系统的性能，还推动了SLMs向更人性化的智能文本处理发展，验证了从概率建模角度的理论证明。

Abstract: The traditional RAG paradigm, which typically engages in the comprehension of
relevant text chunks in response to received queries, inherently restricts both
the depth of knowledge internalization and reasoning capabilities. To address
this limitation, our research transforms the text processing in RAG from
passive chunking to proactive understanding, defining this process as document
memory extraction with the objective of simulating human cognitive processes
during reading. Building upon this, we propose the Mixtures of scenario-aware
document Memories (MoM) framework, engineered to efficiently handle documents
from multiple domains and train small language models (SLMs) to acquire the
ability to proactively explore and construct document memories. The MoM
initially instructs large language models (LLMs) to simulate domain experts in
generating document logical outlines, thereby directing structured chunking and
core content extraction. It employs a multi-path sampling and multi-perspective
evaluation mechanism, specifically designing comprehensive metrics that
represent chunk clarity and extraction completeness to select the optimal
document memories. Additionally, to infuse deeper human-like reading abilities
during the training of SLMs, we incorporate a reverse reasoning strategy, which
deduces refined expert thinking paths from high-quality outcomes. Finally,
leveraging diverse forms of content generated by MoM, we develop a three-layer
document memory retrieval mechanism, which is grounded in our theoretical proof
from the perspective of probabilistic modeling. Extensive experimental results
across three distinct domains demonstrate that the MoM framework not only
resolves text chunking challenges in existing RAG systems, providing LLMs with
semantically complete document memories, but also paves the way for SLMs to
achieve human-centric intelligent text processing.

### [175] [Rewriting History: A Recipe for Interventional Analyses to Study Data Effects on Model Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14261)
*Rahul Nadkarni,Yanai Elazar,Hila Gonen,Noah A. Smith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过干预训练数据批次来研究数据与语言模型行为关系的实验方法，包括选择评估项目、匹配相关文档、修改文档、重新训练和测量效果等步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究训练数据与语言模型行为之间的关系，特别是如何通过干预数据来测试数据对模型行为影响的假设。

Method: 通过"重写历史"的方式干预数据批次，包括从基准测试中选择评估项目、匹配相关文档、修改文档，然后重新训练模型检查点并测量效果。使用共现统计和信息检索方法识别可能有助于知识学习的文档。

Result: 补充了过去将共现与模型行为关联的观察性分析，同时表明现有的相关训练文档识别方法不能完全解释语言模型正确回答知识问题的能力。

Conclusion: 提供了一个可遵循的实验方法，供研究人员进一步测试训练数据如何影响模型行为的假设，代码已公开以促进未来工作。

Abstract: We present an experimental recipe for studying the relationship between
training data and language model (LM) behavior. We outline steps for
intervening on data batches -- i.e., ``rewriting history'' -- and then
retraining model checkpoints over that data to test hypotheses relating data to
behavior. Our recipe breaks down such an intervention into stages that include
selecting evaluation items from a benchmark that measures model behavior,
matching relevant documents to those items, and modifying those documents
before retraining and measuring the effects. We demonstrate the utility of our
recipe through case studies on factual knowledge acquisition in LMs, using both
cooccurrence statistics and information retrieval methods to identify documents
that might contribute to knowledge learning. Our results supplement past
observational analyses that link cooccurrence to model behavior, while
demonstrating that extant methods for identifying relevant training documents
do not fully explain an LM's ability to correctly answer knowledge questions.
Overall, we outline a recipe that researchers can follow to test further
hypotheses about how training data affects model behavior. Our code is made
publicly available to promote future work.

TL;DR: DEG-RAG是一个去噪知识图谱框架，通过实体解析和三元组反思技术清理LLM生成的知识图谱，显著提升图基RAG系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图基RAG系统依赖LLM自动构建知识图谱，但生成的图谱存在噪声（冗余实体和不可靠关系），这会降低检索和生成性能并增加计算成本。现有研究未充分解决LLM生成知识图谱的去噪问题。

Method: 提出DEG-RAG框架，包含两个核心技术：(1) 实体解析：消除冗余实体；(2) 三元组反思：移除错误关系。此外，系统评估了实体解析中的不同阻塞策略、嵌入选择、相似性度量和实体合并技术。

Result: 该方法不仅大幅减小图谱规模，还在多种流行的图基RAG变体中一致提升了问答性能。

Conclusion: DEG-RAG通过简单的去噪方法有效解决了LLM生成知识图谱的噪声问题，为图基RAG系统提供了更紧凑、更高质量的图谱支持。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enable large language models
(LLMs) instant access to relevant information for the generative process,
demonstrating their superior performance in addressing common LLM challenges
such as hallucination, factual inaccuracy, and the knowledge cutoff.
Graph-based RAG further extends this paradigm by incorporating knowledge graphs
(KGs) to leverage rich, structured connections for more precise and inferential
responses. A critical challenge, however, is that most Graph-based RAG systems
rely on LLMs for automated KG construction, often yielding noisy KGs with
redundant entities and unreliable relationships. This noise degrades retrieval
and generation performance while also increasing computational cost. Crucially,
current research does not comprehensively address the denoising problem for
LLM-generated KGs. In this paper, we introduce DEnoised knowledge Graphs for
Retrieval Augmented Generation (DEG-RAG), a framework that addresses these
challenges through: (1) entity resolution, which eliminates redundant entities,
and (2) triple reflection, which removes erroneous relations. Together, these
techniques yield more compact, higher-quality KGs that significantly outperform
their unprocessed counterparts. Beyond the methods, we conduct a systematic
evaluation of entity resolution for LLM-generated KGs, examining different
blocking strategies, embedding choices, similarity metrics, and entity merging
techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive
exploration of entity resolution in LLM-generated KGs. Our experiments
demonstrate that this straightforward approach not only drastically reduces
graph size but also consistently improves question answering performance across
diverse popular Graph-based RAG variants.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现小型多语言模型在检索任务中表现不佳，但通过优化训练数据规模、负采样策略和数据多样性，可以开发出紧凑的300M参数模型，其检索性能达到甚至超过7B大模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管小型多语言模型（<1B参数）在多语言任务中表现良好，但在最常用的检索任务中始终落后于大型模型（>1B），这引发了一个关键问题：能否专门为检索任务改造小型模型以提升其性能？

Method: 研究影响多语言嵌入效果的关键因素，包括训练数据规模、负采样策略和数据多样性。重点关注硬负样本的纳入和任务多样性对性能的影响。

Result: 研究发现增加训练数据规模初期有性能提升但很快达到平台期；纳入硬负样本对持续提升检索准确性至关重要；任务多样性比语言多样性对性能贡献更大。最终开发出300M参数的紧凑多语言模型。

Conclusion: 通过优化训练策略，可以开发出紧凑的多语言模型，在检索任务上达到与大型模型相当甚至更好的性能，证明了小型模型在专门任务上的潜力。

Abstract: Training effective multilingual embedding models presents unique challenges
due to the diversity of languages and task objectives. Although small
multilingual models (<1 B parameters) perform well on multilingual tasks
generally, they consistently lag behind larger models (>1 B) in the most
prevalent use case: retrieval. This raises a critical question: Can smaller
models be retrofitted specifically for retrieval tasks to enhance their
performance? In this work, we investigate key factors that influence the
effectiveness of multilingual embeddings, focusing on training data scale,
negative sampling strategies, and data diversity. We find that while increasing
the scale of training data yields initial performance gains, these improvements
quickly plateau - indicating diminishing returns. Incorporating hard negatives
proves essential for consistently improving retrieval accuracy. Furthermore,
our analysis reveals that task diversity in the training data contributes more
significantly to performance than language diversity alone. As a result, we
develop a compact (approximately 300M) multilingual model that achieves
retrieval performance comparable to or even surpassing current strong 7B
models.

TL;DR: 提出了Qwen3Guard系列安全护栏模型，包含生成式和流式两个变体，支持多语言和细粒度安全分类，解决了现有模型只能输出二元标签且无法实时监控的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全护栏模型存在两个主要局限：1) 只能输出二元安全标签，无法适应不同领域的安全容忍度差异；2) 需要完整模型输出才能进行安全检查，无法与流式推理兼容，导致无法及时干预生成过程。

Method: 开发了两种专门变体：生成式Qwen3Guard将安全分类转化为指令跟随任务，实现三分类判断（安全、争议、不安全）；流式Qwen3Guard引入token级分类头，支持增量文本生成的实时安全监控。提供0.6B、4B和8B三个规模版本，支持119种语言。

Result: 在英语、中文和多语言基准测试中，Qwen3Guard在提示和响应安全分类方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Qwen3Guard为全球LLM部署提供了全面、可扩展和低延迟的安全审核解决方案，所有模型均以Apache 2.0许可证公开发布。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more capable and widely used, ensuring
the safety of their outputs is increasingly critical. Existing guardrail
models, though useful in static evaluation settings, face two major limitations
in real-world applications: (1) they typically output only binary "safe/unsafe"
labels, which can be interpreted inconsistently across diverse safety policies,
rendering them incapable of accommodating varying safety tolerances across
domains; and (2) they require complete model outputs before performing safety
checks, making them fundamentally incompatible with streaming LLM inference,
thereby preventing timely intervention during generation and increasing
exposure to harmful partial outputs. To address these challenges, we present
Qwen3Guard, a series of multilingual safety guardrail models with two
specialized variants: Generative Qwen3Guard, which casts safety classification
as an instruction-following task to enable fine-grained tri-class judgments
(safe, controversial, unsafe); and Stream Qwen3Guard, which introduces a
token-level classification head for real-time safety monitoring during
incremental text generation. Both variants are available in three sizes (0.6B,
4B, and 8B parameters) and support up to 119 languages and dialects, providing
comprehensive, scalable, and low-latency safety moderation for global LLM
deployments. Evaluated across English, Chinese, and multilingual benchmarks,
Qwen3Guard achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prompt and response
safety classification. All models are released under the Apache 2.0 license for
public use.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM的智能检索系统，通过三个专门代理（问题分析器、选择器、添加器）的迭代交互，在多跳问答任务中实现高精度和高召回率的证据检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多跳问答需要检索多个相关证据片段，传统检索方法在精度和召回率方面存在不足，需要更智能的检索系统来提高证据质量。

Method: 使用三个专门代理：问题分析器分解多跳问题为子问题，选择器为每个子问题选择最相关上下文（关注精度），添加器补充缺失证据（关注召回率）。选择器和添加器通过迭代交互产生紧凑而全面的支持段落集。

Result: 在四个多跳问答基准测试（HotpotQA、2WikiMultiHopQA、MuSiQue、MultiHopRAG）上，该方法一致优于强基线模型，实现了更高的检索准确率，同时过滤掉干扰内容。

Conclusion: 该智能检索系统能够显著提高下游问答模型的准确性，同时依赖更少的无关信息，在多跳问答任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Retrieval plays a central role in multi-hop question answering (QA), where
answering complex questions requires gathering multiple pieces of evidence. We
introduce an Agentic Retrieval System that leverages large language models
(LLMs) in a structured loop to retrieve relevant evidence with high precision
and recall. Our framework consists of three specialized agents: a Question
Analyzer that decomposes a multi-hop question into sub-questions, a Selector
that identifies the most relevant context for each sub-question (focusing on
precision), and an Adder that brings in any missing evidence (focusing on
recall). The iterative interaction between Selector and Adder yields a compact
yet comprehensive set of supporting passages. In particular, it achieves higher
retrieval accuracy while filtering out distracting content, enabling downstream
QA models to surpass full-context answer accuracy while relying on
significantly less irrelevant information. Experiments on four multi-hop QA
benchmarks -- HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, MuSiQue, and MultiHopRAG --
demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种上下文感知的双向模式检索框架，将模式链接作为独立问题处理，显著提升Text-to-SQL系统的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模式链接是Text-to-SQL系统中关键但未被充分探索的组件，现有方法主要关注SQL生成而忽视相关模式元素的检索，导致幻觉和执行失败问题。

Method: 采用双向模式检索框架：表优先检索后列选择，列优先检索后表选择，并结合问题分解、关键词提取和关键短语提取技术。

Result: 在BIRD和Spider基准测试中显著提升模式召回率并减少误报，SQL生成性能超越全模式基线并接近oracle性能，无需查询优化即可将完整模式与完美模式之间的性能差距缩小50%。

Conclusion: 模式链接是提升Text-to-SQL准确性和效率的有力杠杆，应作为独立问题处理。

Abstract: Schema linking -- the process of aligning natural language questions with
database schema elements -- is a critical yet underexplored component of
Text-to-SQL systems. While recent methods have focused primarily on improving
SQL generation, they often neglect the retrieval of relevant schema elements,
which can lead to hallucinations and execution failures. In this work, we
propose a context-aware bidirectional schema retrieval framework that treats
schema linking as a standalone problem. Our approach combines two complementary
strategies: table-first retrieval followed by column selection, and
column-first retrieval followed by table selection. It is further augmented
with techniques such as question decomposition, keyword extraction, and
keyphrase extraction. Through comprehensive evaluations on challenging
benchmarks such as BIRD and Spider, we demonstrate that our method
significantly improves schema recall while reducing false positives. Moreover,
SQL generation using our retrieved schema consistently outperforms full-schema
baselines and closely approaches oracle performance, all without requiring
query refinement. Notably, our method narrows the performance gap between full
and perfect schema settings by 50\%. Our findings highlight schema linking as a
powerful lever for enhancing Text-to-SQL accuracy and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术出版物快速增长使科学家难以及时跟踪最新研究，现有论文数据库仅限于相似性匹配和基本分类，无法深入探索概念间的关系网络。

Method: 分析近8000篇开源论文数据，发现论文关键概念路径分布模式与创新点和稀有路径存在强相关性，提出基于提示工程的关键概念路径分析方法，利用小语言模型进行概念提取和创新点识别，构建基于知识图谱约束机制的智能体。

Result: 通过对Qwen和DeepSeek模型进行微调，在准确性方面取得了显著提升，模型已在Hugging Face平台公开可用。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决学术论文分析中关键概念关系网络挖掘不足的问题，为科学家提供更深入的文献分析工具。

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid increase in academic publications across various
fields has posed severe challenges for academic paper analysis: scientists
struggle to timely and comprehensively track the latest research findings and
methodologies. Key concept extraction has proven to be an effective analytical
paradigm, and its automation has been achieved with the widespread application
of language models in industrial and scientific domains. However, existing
paper databases are mostly limited to similarity matching and basic
classification of key concepts, failing to deeply explore the relational
networks between concepts. This paper is based on the OpenAlex opensource
knowledge graph. By analyzing nearly 8,000 open-source paper data from
Novosibirsk State University, we discovered a strong correlation between the
distribution patterns of paper key concept paths and both innovation points and
rare paths. We propose a prompt engineering-based key concept path analysis
method. This method leverages small language models to achieve precise key
concept extraction and innovation point identification, and constructs an agent
based on a knowledge graph constraint mechanism to enhance analysis accuracy.
Through fine-tuning of the Qwen and DeepSeek models, we achieved significant
improvements in accuracy, with the models publicly available on the Hugging
Face platform.

Motivation: 现有数学推理基准主要关注英语或高资源语言，缺乏对多语言和跨语言数学推理能力的评估，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 构建了包含7种语言（涵盖高、中、低资源语言）的平行多语言基准数据集，系统评估了开源和专有LLM在零样本、思维链和代码切换推理范式下的表现。

Result: LLM在多语言数学推理上存在持续缺陷，特别是在低资源语言环境中性能显著下降，无法保持一致的推理能力。

Conclusion: 需要进一步改进LLM的多语言数学推理能力，特别是在低资源语言上的表现，MathMist数据集为此提供了评估基础。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning remains one of the most challenging domains for large
language models (LLMs), requiring not only linguistic understanding but also
structured logical deduction and numerical precision. While recent LLMs
demonstrate strong general-purpose reasoning abilities, their mathematical
competence across diverse languages remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks
primarily focus on English or a narrow subset of high-resource languages,
leaving significant gaps in assessing multilingual and cross-lingual
mathematical reasoning. To address this, we introduce MathMist, a parallel
multilingual benchmark for mathematical problem solving and reasoning. MathMist
encompasses over 21K aligned question-answer pairs across seven languages,
representing a balanced coverage of high-, medium-, and low-resource linguistic
settings. The dataset captures linguistic variety, multiple types of problem
settings, and solution synthesizing capabilities. We systematically evaluate a
diverse suite of models, including open-source small and medium LLMs,
proprietary systems, and multilingual-reasoning-focused models, under
zero-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), and code-switched reasoning paradigms. Our
results reveal persistent deficiencies in LLMs' ability to perform consistent
and interpretable mathematical reasoning across languages, with pronounced
degradation in low-resource settings. All the codes and data are available at

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在对话中的欺骗行为，提出了信念错位指标来量化欺骗，发现LLMs在约26%的对话轮次中会自然表现出欺骗行为，并开发了多轮强化学习方法来减少77.6%的欺骗行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在客服、教育、医疗等应用中与数百万人互动，但其产生欺骗性输出的能力（无论是有意还是无意）带来了严重的安全隐患。LLM行为的不可预测性，加上对幻觉、错误信息和用户操纵的防护不足，使其滥用成为严重的现实风险。

Method: 提出了信念错位指标来量化欺骗，在四种不同对话场景中评估欺骗行为，使用五个已建立的欺骗检测指标和提出的新指标。引入了多轮强化学习方法来微调LLMs以减少欺骗行为。

Result: 新提出的欺骗测量指标与人类判断的相关性比任何现有测试指标都更紧密。LLMs在约26%的对话轮次中会自然表现出欺骗行为，当被提示欺骗时，欺骗性相对基线可增加31%。使用RLHF训练的安全模型仍平均有43%的欺骗率。多轮强化学习方法使欺骗行为减少了77.6%。

Conclusion: 对话中的欺骗行为是在交互历史中发展的行为，其有效评估和缓解需要超越单话语分析。多轮强化学习方法能显著减少LLMs的欺骗行为，为解决这一重要安全问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with millions of people worldwide in
applications such as customer support, education and healthcare. However, their
ability to produce deceptive outputs, whether intentionally or inadvertently,
poses significant safety concerns. The unpredictable nature of LLM behavior,
combined with insufficient safeguards against hallucination, misinformation,
and user manipulation, makes their misuse a serious, real-world risk. In this
paper, we investigate the extent to which LLMs engage in deception within
dialogue, and propose the belief misalignment metric to quantify deception. We
evaluate deception across four distinct dialogue scenarios, using five
established deception detection metrics and our proposed metric. Our findings
reveal this novel deception measure correlates more closely with human
judgments than any existing metrics we test. Additionally, our benchmarking of
eight state-of-the-art models indicates that LLMs naturally exhibit deceptive
behavior in approximately 26% of dialogue turns, even when prompted with
seemingly benign objectives. When prompted to deceive, LLMs are capable of
increasing deceptiveness by as much as 31% relative to baselines. Unexpectedly,
models trained with RLHF, the predominant approach for ensuring the safety of
widely-deployed LLMs, still exhibit deception at a rate of 43% on average.
Given that deception in dialogue is a behavior that develops over an
interaction history, its effective evaluation and mitigation necessitates
moving beyond single-utterance analyses. We introduce a multi-turn
reinforcement learning methodology to fine-tune LLMs to reduce deceptive
behaviors, leading to a 77.6% reduction compared to other instruction-tuned
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病的早期检测对患者有益，可以及早治疗减轻症状并降低医疗负担。语言能力变化是AD的主要征兆之一，可用于早期诊断。

Method: 创建基于Doc2Vec和ELMo的混合词嵌入获取句子困惑度分数，添加语言特征分析语法和语义，将嵌入特征向量输入逻辑回归并微调超参数。

Result: 达到91%分类准确率和97% AUC，在区分早期AD与健康受试者方面优于现有最佳NLP模型（准确率88%），模型稳定性良好。

Conclusion: 该方法准确稳定，可作为AD的大规模筛查方法，以及医生检测AD的补充检查手段。

Abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is greatly beneficial to AD
patients, leading to early treatments that lessen symptoms and alleviating
financial burden of health care. As one of the leading signs of AD, language
capability changes can be used for early diagnosis of AD. In this paper, I
develop a robust classification method using hybrid word embedding and
fine-tuned hyperparameters to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in the early
detection of AD. Specifically, we create a hybrid word embedding based on word
vectors from Doc2Vec and ELMo to obtain perplexity scores of the sentences. The
scores identify whether a sentence is fluent or not and capture semantic
context of the sentences. I enrich the word embedding by adding linguistic
features to analyze syntax and semantics. Further, we input an embedded feature
vector into logistic regression and fine tune hyperparameters throughout the
pipeline. By tuning hyperparameters of the machine learning pipeline (e.g.,
model regularization parameter, learning rate and vector size of Doc2Vec, and
vector size of ELMo), I achieve 91% classification accuracy and an Area Under
the Curve (AUC) of 97% in distinguishing early AD from healthy subjects. Based
on my knowledge, my model with 91% accuracy and 97% AUC outperforms the best
existing NLP model for AD diagnosis with an accuracy of 88% [32]. I study the
model stability through repeated experiments and find that the model is stable
even though the training data is split randomly (standard deviation of accuracy
= 0.0403; standard deviation of AUC = 0.0174). This affirms our proposed method
is accurate and stable. This model can be used as a large-scale screening
method for AD, as well as a complementary examination for doctors to detect AD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在角色扮演中难以忠实、一致地呈现特定版本的角色特征，特别是在拥有多个版本的超级英雄角色中。

Method: 创建包含两个任务的基准测试：Canon Events测试关键事件的事实回忆，Moral Dilemmas测试道德困境处理。提出Think-Act Matching指标量化推理与行动的一致性。

Result: 实验发现：思维链提示能提升弱模型的叙事连贯性但会降低强模型的准确性；跨版本泛化仍是主要挑战；模型往往擅长思考或行动但很少同时擅长两者。

Conclusion: Beyond One World揭示了多宇宙一致性和推理对齐方面的关键差距，为角色扮演LLM提供了具有挑战性的评估标准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as role-playing agents,
yet their capacity to faithfully and consistently portray version-specific
characters -- for example, superheroes across comic and cinematic universes --
remains underexplored. Superhero canons such as Marvel and DC provide a rich
testbed: decades of storytelling yield multiple incarnations of the same
character with distinct histories, values, and moral codes. To study this
problem, we introduce Beyond One World, a benchmark for character-grounded
roleplay spanning 30 iconic heroes and 90 canon-specific versions. The
benchmark comprises two tasks: (i) Canon Events, which probes factual recall of
pivotal life stages, and (ii) Moral Dilemmas, which confronts models with
ethically charged scenarios. We score responses for canonical accuracy and
reasoning fidelity under a framework that separates internal deliberation
("thinking") from outward decisions ("acting"). We further propose Think-Act
Matching, a metric that quantifies alignment between reasons and actions and
serves as a proxy for model trustworthiness. Experiments across reasoning- and
non-reasoning-oriented models yield three findings: (1) chain-of-thought
prompting improves narrative coherence in weaker models but can reduce
canonical accuracy in stronger ones; (2) cross-version generalization within a
character remains a major obstacle; and (3) models often excel at either
thinking or acting, but rarely both. Beyond One World exposes critical gaps in
multiversal consistency and reasoning alignment, offering a challenging
evaluation for role-playing LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需微调的置信驱动多模型框架，通过模型多样性提升医疗问答性能，在PubMedQA和MedMCQA上分别达到95.0%和78.0%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高性能医疗大模型通常需要大量微调和计算资源，限制了资源受限医疗机构的可及性，需要寻找无需微调的高效替代方案。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：置信度检测模块评估主模型确定性，自适应路由机制将低置信度查询定向到具有互补知识的辅助模型进行协作推理。

Result: 在三个医疗基准测试中表现优异，PubMedQA达到95.0%，MedMCQA达到78.0%，显著优于单模型方法和统一推理策略。

Conclusion: 策略性模型协作为改进医疗AI系统提供了实用且计算高效的途径，对资源受限环境中先进医疗AI的民主化具有重要意义。

Abstract: High-performing medical Large Language Models (LLMs) typically require
extensive fine-tuning with substantial computational resources, limiting
accessibility for resource-constrained healthcare institutions. This study
introduces a confidence-driven multi-model framework that leverages model
diversity to enhance medical question answering without fine-tuning. Our
framework employs a two-stage architecture: a confidence detection module
assesses the primary model's certainty, and an adaptive routing mechanism
directs low-confidence queries to Helper models with complementary knowledge
for collaborative reasoning. We evaluate our approach using
Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct, Phi-4 14B, and Gemma 2 12B across three medical
benchmarks; MedQA, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA. Result demonstrate that our framework
achieves competitive performance, with particularly strong results in PubMedQA
(95.0\%) and MedMCQA (78.0\%). Ablation studies confirm that confidence-aware
routing combined with multi-model collaboration substantially outperforms
single-model approaches and uniform reasoning strategies. This work establishes
that strategic model collaboration offers a practical, computationally
efficient pathway to improve medical AI systems, with significant implications
for democratizing access to advanced medical AI in resource-limited settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了现代LLMs对字符级扰动的鲁棒性，通过在每个输入字符后插入不可见Unicode控制字符来防止LLM滥用。尽管这种混淆严重破坏了分词并降低了信噪比，但许多LLM仍能保持显著性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在字符级噪声干扰下的鲁棒性，旨在防止LLM在在线考试系统等场景中的滥用，并评估LLMs在不同应用中的部署可靠性。

Method: 提出了NAMESHORT方法，通过在文本中插入不可见Unicode控制字符来创建字符级扰动，并评估了模型、问题和噪声相关配置对LLM性能的影响。

Result: 令人惊讶的是，尽管存在强烈的混淆效果，许多LLM仍能保持显著性能。研究探索了字符级分词处理以及隐式与显式去噪机制假设。

Conclusion: LLMs在低层级鲁棒性方面的发现揭示了其滥用风险以及在多样化应用中部署LLMs的可靠性问题。

Abstract: This work investigates the resilience of contemporary LLMs against frequent
and structured character-level perturbations, specifically through the
insertion of noisy characters after each input character. We introduce
\nameshort{}, a practical method that inserts invisible Unicode control
characters into text to discourage LLM misuse in scenarios such as online exam
systems. Surprisingly, despite strong obfuscation that fragments tokenization
and reduces the signal-to-noise ratio significantly, many LLMs still maintain
notable performance. Through comprehensive evaluation across model-, problem-,
and noise-related configurations, we examine the extent and mechanisms of this
robustness, exploring both the handling of character-level tokenization and
\textit{implicit} versus \textit{explicit} denoising mechanism hypotheses of
character-level noises. We hope our findings on the low-level robustness of
LLMs will shed light on the risks of their misuse and on the reliability of
deploying LLMs across diverse applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为美国6800万非英语母语者提供准确、及时、文化相关的天气信息，推进天气就绪国家的建设。

Method: 与LILT合作，利用其专利训练过程使大型语言模型适应天气术语和消息传递，结合GIS映射识别语言需求，并整合伦理AI实践。

Result: 开发出可扩展的翻译系统，显著减少手动翻译时间，减轻操作工作量，并创建了包含翻译警告、7天预报和教育活动的实验性多语言网站。

Conclusion: 这项工作使美国向覆盖所有公民的国家预警系统迈进了一步，通过自动化翻译工具提高了天气信息的可及性和准确性。

Abstract: To advance a Weather-Ready Nation, the National Weather Service (NWS) is
developing a systematic translation program to better serve the 68.8 million
people in the U.S. who do not speak English at home. This article outlines the
foundation of an automated translation tool for NWS products, powered by
artificial intelligence. The NWS has partnered with LILT, whose patented
training process enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt neural machine
translation (NMT) tools for weather terminology and messaging. Designed for
scalability across Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) and National Centers, the
system is currently being developed in Spanish, Simplified Chinese, Vietnamese,
and other widely spoken non-English languages. Rooted in best practices for
multilingual risk communication, the system provides accurate, timely, and
culturally relevant translations, significantly reducing manual translation
time and easing operational workloads across the NWS. To guide the distribution
of these products, GIS mapping was used to identify language needs across
different NWS regions, helping prioritize resources for the communities that
need them most. We also integrated ethical AI practices throughout the
program's design, ensuring that transparency, fairness, and human oversight
guide how automated translations are created, evaluated, and shared with the
public. This work has culminated into a website featuring experimental
multilingual NWS products, including translated warnings, 7-day forecasts, and
educational campaigns, bringing the country one step closer to a national
warning system that reaches all Americans.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了pluri-hop问题（需要检索所有文档的聚合问题），并开发了PluriHopWIND数据集和PluriHopRAG方法来解决这类问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有问答系统在处理需要聚合所有文档证据的pluri-hop问题时表现不佳，特别是在重复性高、干扰文档多的实际场景中。

Method: 提出了PluriHopRAG方法：将查询分解为文档级子问题，使用交叉编码器过滤无关文档，再进行LLM推理。

Result: 在PluriHopWIND数据集上，现有方法F1分数不超过40%，而PluriHopRAG实现了18-52%的相对改进。

Conclusion: PluriHopWIND暴露了当前QA系统在重复性语料上的局限性，PluriHopRAG证明了穷尽检索和早期过滤的价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) have enabled progress on question answering (QA) when relevant
evidence is in one (single-hop) or multiple (multi-hop) passages. Yet many
realistic questions about recurring report data - medical records, compliance
filings, maintenance logs - require aggregation across all documents, with no
clear stopping point for retrieval and high sensitivity to even one missed
passage. We term these pluri-hop questions and formalize them by three
criteria: recall sensitivity, exhaustiveness, and exactness. To study this
setting, we introduce PluriHopWIND, a diagnostic multilingual dataset of 48
pluri-hop questions built from 191 real-world wind industry reports in German
and English. We show that PluriHopWIND is 8-40% more repetitive than other
common datasets and thus has higher density of distractor documents, better
reflecting practical challenges of recurring report corpora. We test a
traditional RAG pipeline as well as graph-based and multimodal variants, and
find that none of the tested approaches exceed 40% in statement-wise F1 score.
Motivated by this, we propose PluriHopRAG, a RAG architecture that follows a
"check all documents individually, filter cheaply" approach: it (i) decomposes
queries into document-level subquestions and (ii) uses a cross-encoder filter
to discard irrelevant documents before costly LLM reasoning. We find that
PluriHopRAG achieves relative F1 score improvements of 18-52% depending on base
LLM. Despite its modest size, PluriHopWIND exposes the limitations of current
QA systems on repetitive, distractor-rich corpora. PluriHopRAG's performance
highlights the value of exhaustive retrieval and early filtering as a powerful
alternative to top-k methods.

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析Reddit用户的纵向评论树数据，结合哥伦比亚自杀严重程度评定量表，显著提升了用户自杀风险水平的识别和预测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自杀是全球重要的公共卫生问题，现有研究主要关注单条社交媒体帖子的自杀表达检测，但缺乏对用户历史帖子和互动评论的纵向序列分析，而用户往往通过这些内容随时间推移表露自杀意图。

Method: 构建了基于Reddit的高质量标注数据集，包含用户发帖历史和评论，采用基于哥伦比亚自杀严重程度评定量表的四标签标注框架，并进行统计分析和大型语言模型实验。

Result: 统计分析和大语言模型实验结果表明，纳入评论树数据能显著增强用户自杀风险水平的识别和预测能力。

Conclusion: 这项研究为提升高危个体检测准确率提供了新视角，为早期自杀干预策略奠定了宝贵基础。

Abstract: Suicide remains a critical global public health issue. While previous studies
have provided valuable insights into detecting suicidal expressions in
individual social media posts, limited attention has been paid to the analysis
of longitudinal, sequential comment trees for predicting a user's evolving
suicidal risk. Users, however, often reveal their intentions through historical
posts and interactive comments over time. This study addresses this gap by
investigating how the information in comment trees affects both the
discrimination and prediction of users' suicidal risk levels. We constructed a
high-quality annotated dataset, sourced from Reddit, which incorporates users'
posting history and comments, using a refined four-label annotation framework
based on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Statistical
analysis of the dataset, along with experimental results from Large Language
Models (LLMs) experiments, demonstrates that incorporating comment trees data
significantly enhances the discrimination and prediction of user suicidal risk
levels. This research offers a novel insight to enhancing the detection
accuracy of at-risk individuals, thereby providing a valuable foundation for
early suicide intervention strategies.

TL;DR: 提出了"你的下一个标记预测(YNTP)"任务，通过受控的人机对话建模用户的精确词汇选择，建立了包含100个多语言对话会话的基准数据集，用于评估基于提示和微调的个性化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在通用下一个标记预测方面表现出色，但难以生成反映个体真实沟通风格(如回复邮件或社交消息)的响应，且真实SNS或邮件历史因隐私问题难以收集。

Method: 构建包含英语、日语和中文的100个对话会话多语言基准，用户与基于MBTI维度的心理基础NPC进行五天互动，捕捉自然日常沟通模式；评估基于提示和微调的个性化方法。

Result: 建立了首个YNTP基准数据集，为面向用户的语言建模奠定了基础，数据集已公开可用。

Conclusion: YNTP任务能够有效建模用户的精确词汇选择，为开发更符合个体沟通风格的语言模型提供了重要基准和数据集支持。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general next-token prediction but still
struggle to generate responses that reflect how individuals truly communicate,
such as replying to emails or social messages in their own style. However, real
SNS or email histories are difficult to collect due to privacy concerns. To
address this, we propose the task of "Your Next Token Prediction (YNTP)", which
models a user's precise word choices through controlled human-agent
conversations. We build a multilingual benchmark of 100 dialogue sessions
across English, Japanese, and Chinese, where users interact for five days with
psychologically grounded NPCs based on MBTI dimensions. This setup captures
natural, daily-life communication patterns and enables analysis of users'
internal models. We evaluate prompt-based and fine-tuning-based personalization
methods, establishing the first benchmark for YNTP and a foundation for
user-aligned language modeling. The dataset is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了MedTrust-Guided Iterative RAG框架，通过引用感知推理、迭代检索验证和MedTrust对齐模块，有效减少生物医学问答中的幻觉问题，在多个基准测试中显著提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RAG的生物医学问答系统存在幻觉问题，主要由于检索后噪声和证据验证不足，影响了回答的可靠性。

Method: 1) 引用感知推理，要求所有生成内容必须基于检索的医学文档；2) 迭代检索验证过程，通过验证代理评估证据充分性并优化查询；3) MedTrust对齐模块，结合已验证正例和幻觉感知负例，使用直接偏好优化强化基于引用的推理。

Result: 在MedMCQA、MedQA和MMLU-Med基准测试中，该方法在多个模型架构上均优于竞争基线，LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct和Qwen3-8B分别获得2.7%和2.4%的平均准确率提升。

Conclusion: MedTrust-Guided Iterative RAG框架通过系统性的证据验证和对齐训练，有效提升了生物医学问答的事实一致性和可靠性，为医疗AI应用提供了更可信的解决方案。

Abstract: Biomedical question answering (QA) requires accurate interpretation of
complex medical knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising
capabilities in this domain, with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems
enhancing performance by incorporating external medical literature. However,
RAG-based approaches in biomedical QA suffer from hallucinations due to
post-retrieval noise and insufficient verification of retrieved evidence,
undermining response reliability. We propose MedTrust-Guided Iterative RAG, a
framework designed to enhance factual consistency and mitigate hallucinations
in medical QA. Our method introduces three key innovations. First, it enforces
citation-aware reasoning by requiring all generated content to be explicitly
grounded in retrieved medical documents, with structured Negative Knowledge
Assertions used when evidence is insufficient. Second, it employs an iterative
retrieval-verification process, where a verification agent assesses evidence
adequacy and refines queries through Medical Gap Analysis until reliable
information is obtained. Third, it integrates the MedTrust-Align Module (MTAM)
that combines verified positive examples with hallucination-aware negative
samples, leveraging Direct Preference Optimization to reinforce
citation-grounded reasoning while penalizing hallucination-prone response
patterns. Experiments on MedMCQA, MedQA, and MMLU-Med demonstrate that our
approach consistently outperforms competitive baselines across multiple model
architectures, achieving the best average accuracy with gains of 2.7% for
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct and 2.4% for Qwen3-8B.

Motivation: 语言模型在处理多约束指令时表现不佳，而现有的强化学习方法依赖外部监督且在多约束任务中面临稀疏奖励信号的问题。

Method: 采用无标签自监督强化学习框架，通过约束分解策略和高效的约束级二元分类来生成奖励信号，无需外部监督。

Result: 在3个领域内和5个领域外数据集上均取得显著改进，包括具有挑战性的代理和多轮指令跟随任务。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决多约束指令遵循问题，具有良好的泛化能力，且计算效率高。

Abstract: Language models often struggle to follow multi-constraint instructions that
are crucial for real-world applications. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)
approaches suffer from dependency on external supervision and sparse reward
signals from multi-constraint tasks. We propose a label-free self-supervised RL
framework that eliminates dependency on external supervision by deriving reward
signals directly from instructions and generating pseudo-labels for reward
model training. Our approach introduces constraint decomposition strategies and
efficient constraint-wise binary classification to address sparse reward
challenges while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments show that
our approach generalizes well, achieving strong improvements across 3 in-domain
and 5 out-of-domain datasets, including challenging agentic and multi-turn
instruction following. The data and code are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源深度研究代理主要关注信息检索能力，忽视了信息聚合这一关键需求，限制了其支持深度研究的能力。

Method: 采用Explore to Evolve范式：先通过主动网络探索收集基础信息，然后自我进化聚合程序，从12种高级逻辑类型中选择、组合和优化操作来合成可验证的QA对。

Result: 构建了WebAggregatorQA数据集（10K样本，50K网站，11个领域），WebAggregator-8B模型性能匹配GPT-4.1，32B版本在GAIA-text上超越GPT-4.1 10%以上并接近Claude-3.7-sonnet。在WebAggregatorQA测试集上，Claude-3.7-sonnet仅得28%，GPT-4.1得25.8%。

Conclusion: 即使代理能够检索所有参考资料，在WebAggregatorQA上仍然表现不佳，凸显了加强网络代理基础信息聚合能力的必要性。

Abstract: Deep research web agents not only retrieve information from diverse sources
such as web environments, files, and multimodal inputs, but more importantly,
they need to rigorously analyze and aggregate knowledge for insightful
research. However, existing open-source deep research agents predominantly
focus on enhancing information-seeking capabilities of web agents to locate
specific information, while overlooking the essential need for information
aggregation, which would limit their ability to support in-depth research. We
propose an Explore to Evolve paradigm to scalably construct verifiable training
data for web agents. Begins with proactive online exploration, an agent sources
grounded information by exploring the real web. Using the collected evidence,
the agent then self-evolves an aggregation program by selecting, composing, and
refining operations from 12 high-level logical types to synthesize a verifiable
QA pair. This evolution from high-level guidance to concrete operations allowed
us to scalably produce WebAggregatorQA, a dataset of 10K samples across 50K
websites and 11 domains. Based on an open-source agent framework, SmolAgents,
we collect supervised fine-tuning trajectories to develop a series of
foundation models, WebAggregator. WebAggregator-8B matches the performance of
GPT-4.1, while the 32B variant surpasses GPT-4.1 by more than 10% on GAIA-text
and closely approaches Claude-3.7-sonnet. Moreover, given the limited
availability of benchmarks that evaluate web agents' information aggregation
abilities, we construct a human-annotated evaluation split of WebAggregatorQA
as a challenging test set. On this benchmark, Claude-3.7-sonnet only achieves
28%, and GPT-4.1 scores 25.8%. Even when agents manage to retrieve all
references, they still struggle on WebAggregatorQA, highlighting the need to
strengthen the information aggregation capabilities of web agent foundations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统JSON工具调用中的任务干扰和格式约束问题，这些限制会降低工具调用性能

Method: 提出Natural Language Tools框架，将工具选择与响应生成解耦，消除格式约束

Result: 在10个模型和6400次试验中，工具调用准确率提升18.4个百分点，输出方差降低70%，开源模型获益最大

Conclusion: NLT框架显著改善工具调用性能，对强化学习和监督微调阶段的模型训练都有重要意义，且能扩展工具调用能力到不支持原生调用的模型

Abstract: We present Natural Language Tools (NLT), a framework that replaces
programmatic JSON tool calling in large language models (LLMs) with natural
language outputs. By decoupling tool selection from response generation, NLT
eliminates task interference and format constraints that degrade tool call
performance. When evaluated across 10 models and 6,400 trials spanning customer
service and mental health domains, NLT improves tool calling accuracy by 18.4
percentage points while reducing output variance by 70%. Open-weight models see
the largest gains, surpassing flagship closed-weight alternatives, with
implications for model training in both reinforcement learning and supervised
fine-tuning stages. These improvements persist under prompt perturbations and
extend tool-calling capabilities to models lacking native support.

TL;DR: LiRA框架通过Arca模块将低资源语言锚定到英语语义空间，以及LaSR模块增强跨语言推理，显著提升低资源语言在检索和推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在高资源语言上性能接近饱和，但在低资源语言上表现较差，主要由于训练数据有限、机器翻译噪声和跨语言对齐不稳定。

Method: LiRA包含两个模块：Arca通过锚点对齐和多智能体协作编码将低资源语言锚定到英语语义空间；LaSR在Arca基础上添加语言感知的轻量级推理头，通过一致性正则化增强跨语言理解、检索和推理。

Result: 在低资源基准测试（跨语言检索、语义相似性和推理）中，LiRA在少样本和噪声增强设置下均表现出稳定的性能提升和鲁棒性。消融实验验证了Arca和LaSR的贡献。

Conclusion: LiRA框架有效解决了低资源语言在跨语言表示、检索和推理中的挑战，为多语言NLP提供了稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) rapidly advance, performance on high-resource
languages (e.g., English, Chinese) is nearing saturation, yet remains
substantially lower for low-resource languages (e.g., Urdu, Thai) due to
limited training data, machine-translation noise, and unstable cross-lingual
alignment. We introduce LiRA (Linguistic Robust Anchoring for Large Language
Models), a training framework that robustly improves cross-lingual
representations under low-resource conditions while jointly strengthening
retrieval and reasoning. LiRA comprises two modules: (i) Arca (Anchored
Representation Composition Architecture), which anchors low-resource languages
to an English semantic space via anchor-based alignment and multi-agent
collaborative encoding, preserving geometric stability in a shared embedding
space; and (ii) LaSR (Language-coupled Semantic Reasoner), which adds a
language-aware lightweight reasoning head with consistency regularization on
top of Arca's multilingual representations, unifying the training objective to
enhance cross-lingual understanding, retrieval, and reasoning robustness. We
further construct and release a multilingual product retrieval dataset covering
five Southeast Asian and two South Asian languages. Experiments across
low-resource benchmarks (cross-lingual retrieval, semantic similarity, and
reasoning) show consistent gains and robustness under few-shot and
noise-amplified settings; ablations validate the contribution of both Arca and
LaSR. Code will be released on GitHub and the dataset on Hugging Face.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: seq2seq共指消解模型虽然性能优越，但在增量设置（如对话）中缺乏灵活性和效率，需要处理顺序输入的文本。

Method: 通过提取和重新组织实体级标记，丢弃大部分其他输入标记，创建压缩表示来提高效率。

Result: 在OntoNotes上仅比完整前缀增量基线低0.6 CoNLL F1点，压缩比为1.8；在LitBank上超过最先进性能。

Conclusion: 在seq2seq共指解析器中丢弃大部分标记是增量共指消解的可行策略。

Abstract: Seq2seq coreference models have introduced a new paradigm for coreference
resolution by learning to generate text corresponding to coreference labels,
without requiring task-specific parameters. While these models achieve new
state-of-the-art performance, they do so at the cost of flexibility and
efficiency. In particular, they do not efficiently handle incremental settings
such as dialogue, where text must processed sequentially. We propose a
compressed representation in order to improve the efficiency of these methods
in incremental settings. Our method works by extracting and re-organizing
entity-level tokens, and discarding the majority of other input tokens. On
OntoNotes, our best model achieves just 0.6 CoNLL F1 points below a
full-prefix, incremental baseline while achieving a compression ratio of 1.8.
On LitBank, where singleton mentions are annotated, it passes state-of-the-art
performance. Our results indicate that discarding a wide portion of tokens in
seq2seq resolvers is a feasible strategy for incremental coreference
resolution.

Motivation: 解决主权LLMs发展中缺乏验证框架和数据集的问题，特别是评估模型与用户社会文化背景的契合度以及安全性和技术鲁棒性。

Method: 构建新的数据集并引入分析框架，用于提取和评估主权LLMs的社会文化元素，同时评估其技术鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果表明，主权LLMs在支持低资源语言方面发挥重要作用，但并未完全满足服务目标用户的宣称，且可能低估安全性等关键质量属性。

Conclusion: 推进主权LLMs需要更广泛的评估，纳入更全面、有依据和实用的标准。

Abstract: Recent trends in LLMs development clearly show growing interest in the use
and application of sovereign LLMs. The global debate over sovereign LLMs
highlights the need for governments to develop their LLMs, tailored to their
unique socio-cultural and historical contexts. However, there remains a
shortage of frameworks and datasets to verify two critical questions: (1) how
well these models align with users' socio-cultural backgrounds, and (2) whether
they maintain safety and technical robustness without exposing users to
potential harms and risks. To address this gap, we construct a new dataset and
introduce an analytic framework for extracting and evaluating the
socio-cultural elements of sovereign LLMs, alongside assessments of their
technical robustness. Our experimental results demonstrate that while sovereign
LLMs play a meaningful role in supporting low-resource languages, they do not
always meet the popular claim that these models serve their target users well.
We also show that pursuing this untested claim may lead to underestimating
critical quality attributes such as safety. Our study suggests that advancing
sovereign LLMs requires a more extensive evaluation that incorporates a broader
range of well-grounded and practical criteria.

Conclusion: 成功的偏好建模可能需要中间推理表示而非直接分类，当前RLHF方法主要学习检测客观错误而非捕捉主观质量偏好。

Abstract: Current preference learning methods achieve high accuracy on standard
benchmarks but exhibit significant performance degradation when objective
quality signals are removed. We introduce WritingPreferenceBench, a dataset of
1,800 human-annotated preference pairs (1,200 English, 600 Chinese) across 8
creative writing genres, where responses are matched for objective correctness,
factual accuracy, and length. On this benchmark, sequence-based reward
models--the standard architecture for RLHF--achieve only 52.7% mean accuracy,
while zero-shot language model judges perform at 53.9%. In contrast, generative
reward models that produce explicit reasoning chains achieve 81.8% accuracy. We
observe high within-model variance across genres: individual models range from
18.2% to 81.8% accuracy across different writing categories, with standard
deviations averaging 10.1%. This variance persists regardless of model scale,
with 27B parameter models showing no consistent improvement over 8B variants.
Our results suggest that current RLHF methods primarily learn to detect
objective errors rather than capture subjective quality preferences (e.g.,
creativity, stylistic flair, and emotional resonance), and that successful
preference modeling may require intermediate reasoning representations rather
than direct classification.

TL;DR: 本文提出了CodeSeq数据集，通过将数字序列包装成算法问题来训练LLMs进行归纳推理，结合监督微调和强化学习，提升模型在推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有归纳推理研究存在两个挑战：现有数据主要关注表面规律而缺乏复杂内部模式；现有方法仅提示LLMs或微调简单提示-响应对，未提供精确思维过程或难度控制。

Method: 构建CodeSeq合成后训练数据集，将数字序列包装为算法问题以发现通项（GTG任务）。通过反思失败测试用例和迭代修正生成监督微调数据，结合基于可解性和自生成案例成功率的强化学习奖励机制。

Conclusion: CodeSeq通过结合监督微调和强化学习，有效提升了LLMs的归纳推理能力，使模型能够学习自主案例生成和自我检查。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make remarkable progress in reasoning tasks.
Among different reasoning modes, inductive reasoning, due to its better
alignment with human learning, attracts increasing interest. However, research
on inductive reasoning faces certain challenges. First, existing inductive data
mostly focuses on superficial regularities while lacking more complex internal
patterns. Second, current works merely prompt LLMs or finetune on simple
prompt-response pairs, but do not provide precise thinking processes nor
implement difficulty control. Unlike previous work, we address these challenges
by introducing \textit{CodeSeq}, a synthetic post-training dataset built from
number sequences. We package number sequences into algorithmic problems to
discover their general terms, defining a general term generation (GTG) task
correspondingly. Our pipeline generates supervised finetuning data by
reflecting on failed test cases and incorporating iterative corrections,
thereby teaching LLMs to learn autonomous case generation and self-checking.
Additionally, it leverages reinforcement learning with a novel Case-Synergy
Solvability Scaling Reward based on both solvability, estimated from the
problem pass rate, and the success rate of self-directed case generation,
enabling models to learn more effectively from both successes and failures.
Experimental results show that the models trained with \textit{CodeSeq} improve
on various reasoning tasks and can preserve the models' OOD performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLAIF-SPA框架通过强化学习从AI反馈机制，结合ASR和LLM技术，提升语音合成的情绪表达能力和语义准确性，在Libri Speech数据集上显著优于Chat-TTS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音合成在情感表达方面存在挑战，现有方法依赖昂贵的情绪标注或优化间接目标，导致生成的语音准确但情感平淡。

Method: 提出RLAIF-SPA框架，利用强化学习从AI反馈机制，通过ASR和LLM分别判断语义准确性和韵律-情绪标签对齐，作为情绪表达性和可理解性的直接奖励。采用韵律标签对齐从结构、情绪、速度和语调四个维度提升表达质量。

Result: 在Libri Speech数据集上，RLAIF-SPA相比Chat-TTS实现了26.1%的词错误率降低、9.1%的SIM-O提升，以及超过10%的人工评估改进。

Conclusion: RLAIF-SPA框架有效解决了语音合成中情感表达不足的问题，通过直接优化情绪表达性和语义准确性，显著提升了合成语音的质量。

Abstract: Text-To-Speech synthesis has achieved near-human quality in neutral speech,
but emotional expressiveness remains a challenge. Existing methods often rely
on costly emotion annotations or optimize indirect objectives that fail to
capture the emotional expressiveness and perceptual naturalness of speech,
leading to generated speech that is accurate but emotionally flat. To address
these challenges, we propose the RLAIF-SPA framework, incorporating a
Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) mechanism to employ Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) and Large Language Model (LLM) techniques to
respectively judge semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional label alignment as
a direct reward for emotional expressiveness and intelligibility optimization.
Specifically, it leverages Prosodic Label Alignment to enhance expressive
quality by jointly considering semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional
alignment along four fine-grained dimensions: Structure, Emotion, Speed, and
Tone. In addition, it incorporates Semantic Accuracy Feedback to ensure the
generation of clear and accurate speech. Experiments on the Libri Speech
dataset show that RLAIF-SPA outperforms Chat-TTS, with a 26.1% reduction in
WER, a 9.1% increase in SIM-O, and over 10% improvement in human evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练、无需标签的意图聚类方法，使用轻量级开源LLM生成伪标签，通过多标签分类实现聚类，无需预先知道聚类数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖商业LLM成本高、透明度低，以及需要预先知道聚类数量等实际问题。

Method: 首先让LLM为每个文本生成伪标签，然后在伪标签集上对每个文本进行多标签分类，基于相同聚类的文本共享更多标签的假设，通过嵌入编码实现聚类。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的评估显示，该方法达到或优于现有基线方法，同时保持简单和计算高效。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于低资源场景，在多个模型和数据集上表现稳定，伪标签比直接相似度匹配更易读。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an intuitive, training-free and label-free method
for intent clustering that makes minimal assumptions using lightweight and
open-source LLMs. Many current approaches rely on commercial LLMs, which are
costly, and offer limited transparency. Additionally, their methods often
explicitly depend on knowing the number of clusters in advance, which is often
not the case in realistic settings. To address these challenges, instead of
asking the LLM to match similar text directly, we first ask it to generate
pseudo-labels for each text, and then perform multi-label classification in
this pseudo-label set for each text. This approach is based on the hypothesis
that texts belonging to the same cluster will share more labels, and will
therefore be closer when encoded into embeddings. These pseudo-labels are more
human-readable than direct similarity matches. Our evaluation on four benchmark
sets shows that our approach achieves results comparable to and better than
recent baselines, while remaining simple and computationally efficient. Our
findings indicate that our method can be applied in low-resource scenarios and
is stable across multiple models and datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文比较了对比学习(CL)和监督微调(SFT)在LLM重排序任务中的表现，发现SFT由于提供更强的权重方案而优于CL，并在MRB基准上取得了新的SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在信息检索中，BERT风格的编码器使用对比学习更有效，而LLM使用监督微调更有效，这种差异引发了关于哪种目标函数更适合LLM重排序的研究动机。

Method: 将目标函数分解为权重和方向两个组件，通过探测实验比较CL和SFT，并在UMR平台上进行大规模训练验证。

Result: SFT提供了比CL更强的权重方案，而评分方向没有明显优势，综合来看SFT在LLM重排序中具有一致优势，并在MRB基准上创造了新的SOTA。

Conclusion: SFT在LLM重排序中优于CL，主要归因于其更强的权重机制，这一发现对未来的研究和应用具有重要价值。

Abstract: In information retrieval, training reranking models mainly focuses on two
types of objectives: metric learning (e.g. contrastive loss to increase the
predicted scores on relevant query-document pairs) and classification (binary
label prediction of relevance vs. irrelevance). For BERT-style encoders,
various studies have shown that contrastive learning (CL) can be more effective
than discriminative (classification) learning. However, for large language
models (LLMs), classification via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which predicts
''yes'' (resp. ''no'') token for relevant (resp. irrelevant) pairs, appears
more promising as it aligns well with the generative nature of LLMs. This
divergence raises a central question: which objective is intrinsically better
suited to LLM-based reranking, and what mechanism underlies the difference? In
this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between CL and
SFT for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the
experimental playground. We first decompose the objectives into two components:
weight, which controls the magnitude of those updates, and direction, which
guides the model updates, then present a unified framework for understanding
their interactions. Through probing experiments, we find that SFT provides a
substantially stronger weighting scheme than CL, whereas the preferred scoring
direction shows no clear winner. Taken together, these results point to a
consistent advantage of SFT over CL for LLM reranking. To further validate our
findings, we conduct large-scale training with SFT and present new
state-of-the-art rerankers on the MRB benchmark. We also provide ablations on
SFT settings and expect our findings to benefit future research and
applications in this area.

Motivation: 现有的搜索增强LLMs奖励建模存在局限性：基于规则的奖励对表达变化脆弱且不适用于长文本任务，而生成式奖励在动态语料库中设计可验证且稳定的奖励具有挑战性且计算成本高。

Method: 提出"nugget-as-rubric"范式，将原子信息点作为结构化评估标准；设计自动rubric构建管道，通过查询重写从静态和动态语料库中提取rubrics；引入4B参数的Search-Gen-V生成验证器，采用蒸馏和两阶段训练策略。

Result: 实验结果表明，Search-Gen-V在不同工作负载下实现了强大的验证准确性，使其成为搜索增强LLMs的可扩展、鲁棒且高效的可验证奖励构建器。

Conclusion: 提出的"nugget-as-rubric"范式和Search-Gen-V验证器为搜索增强LLMs提供了一种统一、可验证且高效的奖励建模方法，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Search augmentation empowers Large Language Models with retrieval
capabilities to overcome the limitations imposed by static parameters.
Recently, Reinforcement Learning leverages tailored reward signals as a viable
technique to enhance LLMs performing tasks involving search. However, existing
reward modeling for search-augmented LLMs faces several limitations. Rule-based
rewards, such as Exact Match, are verifiable but fragile to variations in
expression and cannot be applied to long-form workloads. In contrast,
generative rewards improve robustness, but designing verifiable and stable
rewards for long-form workloads in dynamic corpora remains challenging and also
incurs high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a unified and
verifiable paradigm, "nugget-as-rubric", which treats atomic information points
as structured evaluation criteria for different search-augmentation workloads.
Short-form tasks correspond to a single rubric, whereas long-form tasks expand
to multiple rubrics aligned with the question's information needs. To support
long-form settings, we design an automatic rubric construction pipeline based
on query rewriting, which can automatically retrieve passages relevant to each
question and extract rubrics from them, both from static corpora and from
dynamic online web content. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{Search-Gen-V}, a
4B-parameter efficient generative verifier under our proposed verifiable
paradigm, which is trained via the idea of distillation and a two-stage
strategy. Experimental results show that Search-Gen-V achieves strong
verification accuracy across different workloads, making it a scalable, robust,
and efficient verifiable reward constructor for search-augmented LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多模态生成模型是否能有效处理方言文本输入，因为方言使用者在与生成模型交互时经常使用方言。

Method: 构建包含6种英语方言的大规模基准测试，收集4200多个提示，评估17个图像和视频生成模型，并设计基于编码器的缓解策略。

Result: 当前最先进的多模态生成模型在使用单个方言词时性能下降32.26%至48.17%，提出的方法能将5种方言性能提升至与标准英语相当（+34.4%）。

Abstract: Contact languages like English exhibit rich regional variations in the form
of dialects, which are often used by dialect speakers interacting with
generative models. However, can multimodal generative models effectively
produce content given dialectal textual input? In this work, we study this
question by constructing a new large-scale benchmark spanning six common
English dialects. We work with dialect speakers to collect and verify over 4200
unique prompts and evaluate on 17 image and video generative models. Our
automatic and human evaluation results show that current state-of-the-art
multimodal generative models exhibit 32.26% to 48.17% performance degradation
when a single dialect word is used in the prompt. Common mitigation methods
such as fine-tuning and prompt rewriting can only improve dialect performance
by small margins (< 7%), while potentially incurring significant performance
degradation in Standard American English (SAE). To this end, we design a
general encoder-based mitigation strategy for multimodal generative models. Our
method teaches the model to recognize new dialect features while preserving SAE
performance. Experiments on models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 show that our
method is able to simultaneously raise performance on five dialects to be on
par with SAE (+34.4%), while incurring near zero cost to SAE performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Semantic prosody is a collocational meaning formed through the co-occurrence
of a linguistic unit and a consistent series of collocates, which should be
treated separately from semantic meaning. Since words that are literal
translations of each other may have different semantic prosody, more attention
should be paid to this linguistic property to generate accurate translations.
However, current machine translation models cannot handle this problem. To
bridge the gap, we propose an approach to teach machine translation models
about semantic prosody of a specific structure. We focus on Chinese BEI
passives and create a dataset of English-Chinese sentence pairs with the
purpose of demonstrating the negative semantic prosody of BEI passives. Then we
fine-tune OPUS-MT, NLLB-600M and mBART50 models with our dataset for the
English-Chinese translation task. Our results show that fine-tuned MT models
perform better on using BEI passives for translating unfavourable content and
avoid using it for neutral and favourable content. Also, in NLLB-600M, which is
a multilingual model, this knowledge of semantic prosody can be transferred
from English-Chinese translation to other language pairs, such as
Spanish-Chinese.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI医疗工具快速发展带来偏见、隐私侵犯和不平等访问风险，现有自动风险检测方法减少了人类对危害产生机制的理解。

Method: 开发人本框架，生成用户故事并支持多智能体讨论，帮助人们在部署前思考潜在益处和危害。

Result: 用户研究中，阅读故事的参与者识别了更广泛的危害类型，响应分布更均匀；未阅读故事者主要关注隐私和健康（58.3%）。

Conclusion: 故事讲述帮助参与者推测更广泛的危害和益处，更创造性地思考AI对用户的影响。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming healthcare, enabling
fast development of tools like stress monitors, wellness trackers, and mental
health chatbots. However, rapid and low-barrier development can introduce risks
of bias, privacy violations, and unequal access, especially when systems ignore
real-world contexts and diverse user needs. Many recent methods use AI to
detect risks automatically, but this can reduce human engagement in
understanding how harms arise and who they affect. We present a human-centered
framework that generates user stories and supports multi-agent discussions to
help people think creatively about potential benefits and harms before
deployment. In a user study, participants who read stories recognized a broader
range of harms, distributing their responses more evenly across all 13 harm
types. In contrast, those who did not read stories focused primarily on privacy
and well-being (58.3%). Our findings show that storytelling helped participants
speculate about a broader range of harms and benefits and think more creatively
about AI's impact on users.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型从感知任务发展到复杂多步推理，但基于可验证奖励的强化学习通常只奖励最终答案正确性，导致虚假推理。

Method: 提出AutoRubric-R1V框架，通过可扩展的自聚合方法从成功轨迹中提取一致的推理检查点，无需人工标注或更强的教师模型即可构建问题特定的评分标准。

Result: 在六个多模态推理基准测试中达到最先进性能，并在专门评估中显著提高了推理的忠实度。

Conclusion: 通过联合利用基于评分标准和结果的奖励，AutoRubric-R1V有效解决了多模态推理中的虚假推理问题，实现了更好的推理性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have rapidly advanced from
perception tasks to complex multi-step reasoning, yet reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards (RLVR) often leads to spurious reasoning since only the
final-answer correctness is rewarded. To address this limitation, we propose
AutoRubric-R1V, a framework that integrates RLVR with process-level supervision
through automatically collected rubric-based generative rewards. Our key
innovation lies in a scalable self-aggregation method that distills consistent
reasoning checkpoints from successful trajectories, enabling problem-specific
rubric construction without human annotation or stronger teacher models. By
jointly leveraging rubric-based and outcome rewards, AutoRubric-R1V achieves
state-of-the-art performance on six multimodal reasoning benchmarks and
substantially improves reasoning faithfulness in dedicated evaluations.

Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注功能正确性，但硬件设计还需要优化综合指标如面积、延迟和功耗。现有基准缺乏优化的基线实现和验证测试平台。

Method: 开发Pluto基准测试框架，包含114个设计问题，每个问题配备自检测试平台和多个帕累托最优参考实现，用于全面评估LLM生成的Verilog设计效率。

Result: 最先进的LLM在功能正确性上达到78.3%(pass@1)，但在综合效率方面表现较差：面积效率63.8%、延迟效率65.9%、功耗效率64.0%(eff@1)，明显落后于专家设计。

Conclusion: 需要像Pluto这样的效率感知评估框架来推动硬件领域LLM研究的进展，当前LLM在硬件设计效率方面仍有很大提升空间。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate hardware
design tasks, including the generation of Verilog code. While early benchmarks
focus primarily on functional correctness, efficient hardware design demands
additional optimization for synthesis metrics such as area, delay, and power.
Existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these aspects comprehensively:
they often lack optimized baselines or testbenches for verification. To address
these gaps, we present Pluto, a benchmark and evaluation framework designed to
assess the efficiency of LLM-generated Verilog designs. Pluto presents a
comprehensive evaluation set of 114 problems with self-checking testbenches and
multiple Pareto-optimal reference implementations. Experimental results show
that state-of-the-art LLMs can achieve high functional correctness, reaching
78.3\% at pass@1, but their synthesis efficiency still lags behind
expert-crafted implementations, with area efficiency of 63.8\%, delay
efficiency of 65.9\%, and power efficiency of 64.0\% at eff@1. This highlights
the need for efficiency-aware evaluation frameworks such as Pluto to drive
progress in hardware-focused LLM research.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在创意写作方面存在系统性缺陷，特别是在非英语语境中，训练数据稀缺且缺乏过程级监督。

Method: 构建COIG-Writer数据集，包含1,665个三元组（逆向工程提示、详细创作推理、最终文本），涵盖51种体裁。通过全面实验分析创意写作的两组件模型。

Result: 过程监督非常有效但需要通用数据稳定（至少1:12比例）；创意能力具有文化特异性（中英文表现差距89.26%）；词汇多样性与创意质量负相关（TTR悖论）。

Conclusion: 创意卓越源于逻辑脚手架与语言基础的相互作用，类似于数学推理增强但不能替代基础模型中的语言能力。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit systematic deficiencies in creative writing,
particularly in non-English contexts where training data is scarce and lacks
process-level supervision. We present COIG-Writer, a novel Chinese creative
writing dataset that captures both diverse outputs and their underlying thought
processes through systematic reverse-engineering of high-quality texts. Unlike
existing datasets that provide only input-output pairs, COIG-Writer comprises
1,665 meticulously curated triplets spanning 51 genres, each containing: (1) a
reverse-engineered prompt, (2) detailed creative reasoning documenting
decision-making processes, and (3) the final text. Through comprehensive
experiments, we identify a two-component model of creative writing: narrative
logic (provided by process supervision) and linguistic expression (maintained
by general-purpose data). Our findings reveal three critical insights: (1)
Process supervision is highly effective but requires stabilization with general
data. A ratio of at least one creative sample to twelve general samples is
needed to achieve optimal performance; below this threshold, the win rate
progressively degrades (from 62.75% down to 35.78%)., (2) creative capabilities
are culturally-bound with no cross-lingual transfer (89.26pp gap between
Chinese and English performance), and (3) lexical diversity inversely
correlates with creative quality (TTR paradox), suggesting high diversity
signals compensatory behavior for logical deficiencies. These findings
establish that creative excellence emerges from the interaction between logical
scaffolding and linguistic grounding, analogous to how mathematical reasoning
enhances but cannot replace linguistic competence in foundation models.

Result: 该方法在数学问题和开放式问答任务中表现出改进的性能和增强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架可为模型评估提供更可靠的结果，对答案提取规则不敏感。

Abstract: Evaluating generative models, such as large language models (LLMs), commonly
involves question-answering tasks where the final answer is selected based on
probability of answer choices. On the other hand, for models requiring
reasoning, the method of answer extraction plays a critical role. Our research
reveals that the performance of reasoning models and their final answer
distributions are highly sensitive to the answer extraction algorithm employed.
In order to mitigate this, we propose a basic framework: Answer Regeneration.
The method uses an additional model inference, providing the prior input and
output prefaced by the prompt "Answer:". The final answer is then selected or
extracted from the regenerated output. We show that this
extraction-rule-agnostic approach exhibits improved performance and enhanced
robustness. Furthermore, we have applied this framework to general math
problems and open-ended question answering tasks. Our analysis and this
framework could offer a more reliable results for model evaluation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型在部署中由于分布偏移导致路由决策不理想，现有测试时适应方法主要针对密集模型且需要外部数据，限制了在MoE架构中的实用性。

Method: 采用两阶段循环：在预填充阶段和定期间隔中，基于已生成序列通过自监督优化路由决策；然后正常生成文本，保持修改后的路由器直到下一次适应。通过轻量级加性向量仅更新选定层的路由器logits。

Result: 在具有挑战性的推理任务上获得一致性能提升，同时保持对上下文偏移的鲁棒性。例如，在HumanEval上实现5.5%的改进，与自一致性结合时在DeepSeek-V2-Lite上获得6%的平均增益。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无需数据、即插即用的测试时适应方案，有效提升MoE模型的推理性能，并能与现有测试时扩展技术自然互补。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models achieve efficient scaling through sparse
expert activation, but often suffer from suboptimal routing decisions due to
distribution shifts in deployment. While existing test-time adaptation methods
could potentially address these issues, they primarily focus on dense models
and require access to external data, limiting their practical applicability to
MoE architectures. However, we find that, instead of relying on reference data,
we can optimize MoE expert selection on-the-fly based only on input context. As
such, we propose \textit{a data-free, online test-time framework} that
continuously adapts MoE routing decisions during text generation without
external supervision or data. Our method cycles between two phases: During the
prefill stage, and later in regular intervals, we optimize the routing
decisions of the model using self-supervision based on the already generated
sequence. Then, we generate text as normal, maintaining the modified router
until the next adaption. We implement this through lightweight additive vectors
that only update router logits in selected layers, maintaining computational
efficiency while preventing over-adaptation. The experimental results show
consistent performance gains on challenging reasoning tasks while maintaining
robustness to context shifts. For example, our method achieves a 5.5\%
improvement on HumanEval with OLMoE. Furthermore, owing to its plug-and-play
property, our method naturally complements existing test-time scaling
techniques, e.g., achieving 6\% average gains when incorporated with
self-consistency on DeepSeek-V2-Lite.

### [214] [Midtraining Bridges Pretraining and Posttraining Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14865)
*Emmy Liu,Graham Neubig,Chenyan Xiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了语言模型预训练中的"中期训练"阶段，发现其在数学和代码领域效果最佳，能有效减少预训练与后训练数据之间的语法差距，相比持续预训练能获得更好性能并减少遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管中期训练在实践中很流行，但对其有效性原因缺乏科学理解。本研究旨在通过受控实验系统探究中期训练的作用机制和效果。

Method: 使用从头开始预训练的语言模型，在不同领域的有监督微调数据集上进行实验，对中期训练开始时间和数据混合权重进行消融研究。

Result: 中期训练在数学和代码领域效果最显著，能同时改善领域内验证损失和减少预训练数据遗忘。早期引入专门数据比数据混合权重更重要。

Conclusion: 中期训练是一种领域适应技术，相比持续预训练能通过减少遗忘获得更好性能，特别是在语法差距较大的领域如数学和代码。

Abstract: Recently, many language models have been pretrained with a "midtraining"
phase, in which higher quality, often instruction-formatted data, is mixed in
at the end of pretraining. Despite the popularity of this practice, there is
little scientific understanding of this phase of model training or why it is
effective. In this work, we conduct the first systematic investigation of
midtraining through controlled experiments with language models pretrained from
scratch and fine-tuned on supervised finetuning datasets in different domains.
We find that when compared after supervised fine-tuning, the effectiveness of
midtraining is highest in the math and code domains, where midtraining can best
reduce the syntactic gap between pretraining and posttraining data. In these
cases, midtraining consistently outperforms continued pretraining in both
in-domain validation loss as well as pretraining data forgetting after
posttraining. We conduct ablations on the starting time of the midtraining
phase and mixture weights of the midtraining data, using code midtraining as a
case study, and find that timing has a greater impact than mixture weights,
with earlier introduction of specialized data, yielding greater benefits
in-domain as well as preserving general language modeling better. These
findings establish midtraining as a domain adaptation technique that compared
to continued pretraining yields better performance through reduced forgetting.

TL;DR: MLIR-AIR是一个基于MLIR构建的新型编译器栈，专门针对AMD NPU等空间架构，通过AIR方言提供异步和层次化操作的表示，实现空间调度和计算通信重叠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用编译器无法充分利用现代空间架构的细粒度控制和并行性，需要专门的编译器基础设施来协调计算和数据移动。

Method: 基于MLIR构建MLIR-AIR编译器栈，定义AIR方言来表示异步和层次化操作，支持空间调度、计算分布和通信计算重叠。

Result: 在矩阵乘法中达到78.7%的计算效率，性能接近手工优化的MLIR-AIE实现；多注意力头融合实现仅需约150行代码。

Conclusion: MLIR-AIR能够将高级控制流转换为高效利用NPU计算结构和内存层次的空间程序，通过编译器管理的调度实现异步执行和通信重叠。

Abstract: General-purpose compilers abstract away parallelism, locality, and
synchronization, limiting their effectiveness on modern spatial architectures.
As modern computing architectures increasingly rely on fine-grained control
over data movement, execution order, and compute placement for performance,
compiler infrastructure must provide explicit mechanisms for orchestrating
compute and data to fully exploit such architectures. We introduce MLIR-AIR, a
novel, open-source compiler stack built on MLIR that bridges the semantic gap
between high-level workloads and fine-grained spatial architectures such as
AMD's NPUs. MLIR-AIR defines the AIR dialect, which provides structured
representations for asynchronous and hierarchical operations across compute and
memory resources. AIR primitives allow the compiler to orchestrate spatial
scheduling, distribute computation across hardware regions, and overlap
communication with computation without relying on ad hoc runtime coordination
or manual scheduling. We demonstrate MLIR-AIR's capabilities through two case
studies: matrix multiplication and the multi-head attention block from the
LLaMA 2 model. For matrix multiplication, MLIR-AIR achieves up to 78.7% compute
efficiency and generates implementations with performance almost identical to
state-of-the-art, hand-optimized matrix multiplication written using the
lower-level, close-to-metal MLIR-AIE framework. For multi-head attention, we
demonstrate that the AIR interface supports fused implementations using
approximately 150 lines of code, enabling tractable expression of complex
workloads with efficient mapping to spatial hardware. MLIR-AIR transforms
high-level structured control flow into spatial programs that efficiently
utilize the compute fabric and memory hierarchy of an NPU, leveraging
asynchronous execution, tiling, and communication overlap through
compiler-managed scheduling.

Motivation: 解决LLM在语义等价输入下生成不一致输出的问题，当前缺乏一致性训练数据和微调技术的局限性阻碍了RAG系统的可靠性提升。

Method: 结合系统化合成数据生成、三元组损失优化嵌入表示，以及基于中间层激活的一致性感知权重的分层模型融合方法。

Result: 融合模型显著提升了输出一致性，响应相似度相比基线提高了约47.5%，为工业RAG系统提供了实用的可靠性增强方案。

Conclusion: 该方法通过创新的模型融合策略有效整合了专业模型的知识，为提升RAG系统可靠性提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems leverage Large Language Models
(LLMs) to generate accurate and reliable responses that are grounded in
retrieved context. However, LLMs often generate inconsistent outputs for
semantically equivalent inputs, a problem compounded by the scarcity of
consistency-focused training data and the limitations of current fine-tuning
techniques in enhancing output consistency. We propose a new approach combining
systematic synthetic data generation, triplet loss for better embeddings, and a
novel layer-wise model merging approach. Using consistency-aware weights
derived from intermediate layer activations, our method effectively integrates
knowledge from specialized models. Experimental results how that our merged
model significantly enhances output consistency, achieving a ~47.5\%
improvement in response similarity over the baseline, thus offering a practical
solution for increasing the reliability of an industrial RAG system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的缩放定律无法捕捉下游任务性能，其中上下文起着关键作用，需要新的框架来理解训练计算与上下文利用之间的相互作用。

Method: 提出了一个简单可解释的框架，在Llama-2-7B和Llama-2-13B的扩展上下文版本上进行实证验证，涵盖65,500个实例的三种任务：算术推理、常识推理和机器翻译。

Result: 框架准确建模了分布内下游性能，在三个数量级的训练计算量上具有泛化能力，并能可靠地外推随着上下文增加的性能表现。

Conclusion: 这些发现为设计更高效的长上下文LLM提供了指导，揭示了训练计算与上下文利用之间的相互作用。

Abstract: Scaling laws have transformed our understanding of large language models by
linking upstream metrics like cross-entropy loss to design factors such as
model size, training data, and compute. However, these conventional laws fail
to capture downstream task performance, where context plays a critical role. In
this work, we propose a straightforward, interpretable framework that jointly
models downstream performance as a function of the training compute and the
provided context. We empirically validate our framework by fitting it on the
observed downstream performance of extended-context variants of Llama-2-7B and
Llama-2-13B across 65,500 unique instances spanning three tasks: arithmetic
reasoning, common sense reasoning, and machine translation. Our results
demonstrate that our framework accurately models in-distribution downstream
performance, generalizes across three orders of magnitude in training compute,
and reliably extrapolates performance as the amount of context increases. These
findings offer valuable insights into the interplay between training compute
and context utilization, providing guidance for designing more efficient
long-context LLMs for diverse downstream tasks. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 该研究评估了机器学习模型在心理健康筛查中的有效性，使用553个真实世界半结构化访谈数据，针对重度抑郁发作、焦虑症和PTSD进行诊断。模型在各类诊断中达到80%以上准确率，PTSD检测表现尤为突出（89%准确率，98%召回率）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理健康障碍是全球致残的主要原因，但由于主观评估、临床资源有限以及污名化等因素，抑郁症、焦虑症和PTSD经常被漏诊或误诊。初级医疗机构中，医生误诊抑郁症或焦虑症的比例超过60%，迫切需要可扩展、易获取且情境感知的诊断工具来支持早期检测和干预。

Method: 使用553个真实世界半结构化访谈数据集，评估多种机器学习模型，包括GPT-4.1 Mini和MetaLLaMA的零样本提示，以及使用低秩适应（LoRA）微调的RoBERTa模型。研究发现使用较短的、聚焦的上下文片段可以提高召回率。

Result: 模型在各类诊断类别中达到80%以上准确率，PTSD检测表现最佳（准确率高达89%，召回率98%）。低秩配置（如秩8和16）在各种评估指标上保持竞争力。聚焦的叙事线索增强了检测敏感性。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的模型相比传统自报告筛查工具能提供显著改进，为低门槛、AI驱动的早期诊断开辟了道路。这项工作为将机器学习整合到真实世界临床工作流程奠定了基础，特别是在资源匮乏或污名化严重、及时心理健康护理获取最受限的环境中。

Abstract: Mental health disorders remain among the leading cause of disability
worldwide, yet conditions such as depression, anxiety, and Post-Traumatic
Stress Disorder (PTSD) are frequently underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed due to
subjective assessments, limited clinical resources, and stigma and low
awareness. In primary care settings, studies show that providers misidentify
depression or anxiety in over 60% of cases, highlighting the urgent need for
scalable, accessible, and context-aware diagnostic tools that can support early
detection and intervention. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of
machine learning models for mental health screening using a unique dataset of
553 real-world, semistructured interviews, each paried with ground-truth
diagnoses for major depressive episodes (MDE), anxiety disorders, and PTSD. We
benchmark multiple model classes, including zero-shot prompting with GPT-4.1
Mini and MetaLLaMA, as well as fine-tuned RoBERTa models using LowRank
Adaptation (LoRA). Our models achieve over 80% accuracy across diagnostic
categories, with especially strongperformance on PTSD (up to 89% accuracy and
98% recall). We also find that using shorter context, focused context segments
improves recall, suggesting that focused narrative cues enhance detection
sensitivity. LoRA fine-tuning proves both efficient and effective, with
lower-rank configurations (e.g., rank 8 and 16) maintaining competitive
performance across evaluation metrics. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based
models can offer substantial improvements over traditional self-report
screening tools, providing a path toward low-barrier, AI-powerd early
diagnosis. This work lays the groundwork for integrating machine learning into
real-world clinical workflows, particularly in low-resource or high-stigma
environments where access to timely mental health care is most limited.

Motivation: 现有RLVR方法需要模型使用两个独立提示模板顺序生成解法和自我验证，效率低下。本文旨在简化这一过程，提高效率。

Method: 理论推导出自我验证的RL目标闭式解可简化为最后一词自奖励分数，提出LaSeR算法，在原RLVR损失基础上添加MSE损失对齐自奖励分数与验证器推理奖励。

Result: 实验表明该方法不仅提升模型推理性能，还赋予其出色的自奖励能力，增强了推理时扩展性能。

Conclusion: LaSeR通过最后一词自奖励机制实现了高效的推理和自我验证统一，显著降低了计算成本并提升了性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a core paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). To address the lack of verification signals at test time, prior
studies incorporate the training of model's self-verification capability into
the standard RLVR process, thereby unifying reasoning and verification
capabilities within a single LLM. However, previous practice requires the LLM
to sequentially generate solutions and self-verifications using two separate
prompt templates, which significantly reduces efficiency. In this work, we
theoretically reveal that the closed-form solution to the RL objective of
self-verification can be reduced to a remarkably simple form: the true
reasoning reward of a solution is equal to its last-token self-rewarding score,
which is computed as the difference between the policy model's next-token
log-probability assigned to any pre-specified token at the solution's last
token and a pre-calculated constant, scaled by the KL coefficient. Based on
this insight, we propose LaSeR (Reinforcement Learning with Last-Token
Self-Rewarding), an algorithm that simply augments the original RLVR loss with
a MSE loss that aligns the last-token self-rewarding scores with verifier-based
reasoning rewards, jointly optimizing the reasoning and self-rewarding
capabilities of LLMs. The optimized self-rewarding scores can be utilized in
both training and testing to enhance model performance. Notably, our algorithm
derives these scores from the predicted next-token probability distribution of
the last token immediately after generation, incurring only the minimal extra
cost of one additional token inference. Experiments show that our method not
only improves the model's reasoning performance but also equips it with
remarkable self-rewarding capability, thereby boosting its inference-time
scaling performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on
general text; however, their proficiency in specialized scientific domains that
require deep, interconnected knowledge remains largely uncharacterized.
Metabolomics presents unique challenges with its complex biochemical pathways,
heterogeneous identifier systems, and fragmented databases. To systematically
evaluate LLM capabilities in this domain, we introduce MetaBench, the first
benchmark for metabolomics assessment. Curated from authoritative public
resources, MetaBench evaluates five capabilities essential for metabolomics
research: knowledge, understanding, grounding, reasoning, and research. Our
evaluation of 25 open- and closed-source LLMs reveals distinct performance
patterns across metabolomics tasks: while models perform well on text
generation tasks, cross-database identifier grounding remains challenging even
with retrieval augmentation. Model performance also decreases on long-tail
metabolites with sparse annotations. With MetaBench, we provide essential
infrastructure for developing and evaluating metabolomics AI systems, enabling
systematic progress toward reliable computational tools for metabolomics
research.

Conclusion: IGPO通过内在奖励机制有效解决了多轮智能体训练中的奖励稀疏问题，为复杂交互任务提供了更有效的强化学习框架

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly trained with
reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their ability to interact with external
environments through tool use, particularly in search-based settings that
require multi-turn reasoning and knowledge acquisition. However, existing
approaches typically rely on outcome-based rewards that are only provided at
the final answer. This reward sparsity becomes particularly problematic in
multi-turn settings, where long trajectories exacerbate two critical issues:
(i) advantage collapse, where all rollouts receive identical rewards and
provide no useful learning signals, and (ii) lack of fine-grained credit
assignment, where dependencies between turns are obscured, especially in
long-horizon tasks. In this paper, we propose Information Gain-based Policy
Optimization (IGPO), a simple yet effective RL framework that provides dense
and intrinsic supervision for multi-turn agent training. IGPO models each
interaction turn as an incremental process of acquiring information about the
ground truth, and defines turn-level rewards as the marginal increase in the
policy's probability of producing the correct answer. Unlike prior
process-level reward approaches that depend on external reward models or costly
Monte Carlo estimation, IGPO derives intrinsic rewards directly from the
model's own belief updates. These intrinsic turn-level rewards are combined
with outcome-level supervision to form dense reward trajectories. Extensive
experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that
IGPO consistently outperforms strong baselines in multi-turn scenarios,
achieving higher accuracy and improved sample efficiency.

Motivation: 数字代理需要多样化、大规模的UI轨迹来泛化现实世界任务，但收集此类数据在人工标注、基础设施和工程方面成本过高。

Method: 集成数字世界模拟器生成多样化UI状态，使用引导展开过程进行连贯探索，并通过轨迹包装器生成高质量多样化轨迹。还提出UI-Simulator-Grow目标缩放策略，优先处理高影响力任务并合成信息丰富的轨迹变体。

Result: 在WebArena和AndroidWorld上的实验表明，UI-Simulator在鲁棒性方面优于或媲美在真实UI上训练的开源代理，尽管使用较弱的教师模型。UI-Simulator-Grow仅使用Llama-3-8B-Instruct作为基础模型就能达到Llama-3-70B-Instruct的性能。

Conclusion: 目标合成缩放范式具有持续高效增强数字代理的潜力，为解决UI轨迹数据收集的高成本问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Digital agents require diverse, large-scale UI trajectories to generalize
across real-world tasks, yet collecting such data is prohibitively expensive in
both human annotation, infra and engineering perspectives. To this end, we
introduce $\textbf{UI-Simulator}$, a scalable paradigm that generates
structured UI states and transitions to synthesize training trajectories at
scale. Our paradigm integrates a digital world simulator for diverse UI states,
a guided rollout process for coherent exploration, and a trajectory wrapper
that produces high-quality and diverse trajectories for agent training. We
further propose $\textbf{UI-Simulator-Grow}$, a targeted scaling strategy that
enables more rapid and data-efficient scaling by prioritizing high-impact tasks
and synthesizes informative trajectory variants. Experiments on WebArena and
AndroidWorld show that UI-Simulator rivals or surpasses open-source agents
trained on real UIs with significantly better robustness, despite using weaker
teacher models. Moreover, UI-Simulator-Grow matches the performance of
Llama-3-70B-Instruct using only Llama-3-8B-Instruct as the base model,
highlighting the potential of targeted synthesis scaling paradigm to
continuously and efficiently enhance the digital agents.

TL;DR: 论文提出了TokDrift框架，发现代码LLM对语义相同但格式不同的代码会产生不同的tokenization，导致模型行为显著变化，这揭示了当前子词tokenization在代码理解中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码LLM使用的子词tokenizer（如BPE）基于统计而非语法，导致语义相同的代码片段可能因格式差异而被不同地tokenize，这种不对齐可能影响模型可靠性。

Method: 引入TokDrift框架，应用语义保持的重写规则创建仅在tokenization上不同的代码变体，分析九个代码LLM在不同格式代码上的行为变化，并进行层间分析。

Result: 即使微小的格式变化也会导致模型行为显著偏移，层间分析显示问题源于早期嵌入层，子词分割未能捕获语法token边界。

Conclusion: tokenization不对齐是代码理解和生成的隐藏障碍，未来的代码LLM需要语法感知的tokenization方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for code rely on subword tokenizers, such as
byte-pair encoding (BPE), learned from mixed natural language text and
programming language code but driven by statistics rather than grammar. As a
result, semantically identical code snippets can be tokenized differently
depending on superficial factors such as whitespace or identifier naming. To
measure the impact of this misalignment, we introduce TokDrift, a framework
that applies semantic-preserving rewrite rules to create code variants
differing only in tokenization. Across nine code LLMs, including large ones
with over 30B parameters, even minor formatting changes can cause substantial
shifts in model behavior. Layer-wise analysis shows that the issue originates
in early embeddings, where subword segmentation fails to capture grammar token
boundaries. Our findings identify misaligned tokenization as a hidden obstacle
to reliable code understanding and generation, highlighting the need for
grammar-aware tokenization for future code LLMs.

TL;DR: Elastic-Cache是一种无需训练、架构无关的KV缓存自适应刷新策略，通过注意力感知漂移测试和深度感知调度，减少扩散大语言模型中的冗余计算，显著加速解码过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在每个去噪步骤和所有层都重新计算所有token的QKV，但KV状态在大多数步骤中变化很小，特别是在浅层，导致大量冗余计算。

Method: 提出Elastic-Cache策略：1）基于最受关注token的注意力感知漂移测试决定何时刷新；2）基于深度感知调度决定从哪层开始刷新，同时重用浅层缓存和窗口外MASK缓存。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成任务上实现显著加速：GSM8K上8.7倍，长序列上45.1倍，HumanEval上4.8倍，同时保持比基线更高的准确率。在GSM8K上吞吐量比现有方法高6.8倍。

Conclusion: Elastic-Cache通过自适应、层感知的缓存更新有效减少冗余计算，显著加速扩散大语言模型的解码过程，同时保持生成质量，实现实际部署。

Abstract: This work studies how to adaptively recompute key-value (KV) caches for
diffusion large language models (DLMs) to maximize prediction accuracy while
minimizing decoding latency. Prior methods' decoders recompute QKV for all
tokens at every denoising step and layer, despite KV states changing little
across most steps, especially in shallow layers, leading to substantial
redundancy. We make three observations: (1) distant ${\bf MASK}$ tokens
primarily act as a length-bias and can be cached block-wise beyond the active
prediction window; (2) KV dynamics increase with depth, suggesting that
selective refresh starting from deeper layers is sufficient; and (3) the
most-attended token exhibits the smallest KV drift, providing a conservative
lower bound on cache change for other tokens. Building on these, we propose
${\bf Elastic-Cache}$, a training-free, architecture-agnostic strategy that
jointly decides ${when}$ to refresh (via an attention-aware drift test on the
most-attended token) and ${where}$ to refresh (via a depth-aware schedule that
recomputes from a chosen layer onward while reusing shallow-layer caches and
off-window MASK caches). Unlike fixed-period schemes, Elastic-Cache performs
adaptive, layer-aware cache updates for diffusion LLMs, reducing redundant
computation and accelerating decoding with negligible loss in generation
quality. Experiments on LLaDA-Instruct, LLaDA-1.5, and LLaDA-V across
mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate consistent
speedups: $8.7\times$ on GSM8K (256 tokens), $45.1\times$ on longer sequences,
and $4.8\times$ on HumanEval, while consistently maintaining higher accuracy
than the baseline. Our method achieves significantly higher throughput
($6.8\times$ on GSM8K) than existing confidence-based approaches while
preserving generation quality, enabling practical deployment of diffusion LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型有效性验证方法依赖预定义的有效性框架，但这些框架可能不可用或不充分。需要一种更灵活的方法来确定模型在决策过程中的有效性。

Method: DOTechnique方法通过评估替代模型与高保真模型在决策上的一致性来确定有效性区域，结合领域约束和符号推理来缩小搜索空间，提高计算效率。

Result: 以高速公路变道系统为例，展示了DOTechnique能够发现仿真模型的有效性区域，证明了该技术的实用性。

Conclusion: DOTechnique技术有潜力通过决策者上下文支持发现模型有效性，为模型验证提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Model validity is as critical as the model itself, especially when guiding
decision-making processes. Traditional approaches often rely on predefined
validity frames, which may not always be available or sufficient. This paper
introduces the Decision Oriented Technique (DOTechnique), a novel method for
determining model validity based on decision consistency rather than output
similarity. By evaluating whether surrogate models lead to equivalent decisions
compared to high-fidelity models, DOTechnique enables efficient identification
of validity regions, even in the absence of explicit validity boundaries. The
approach integrates domain constraints and symbolic reasoning to narrow the
search space, enhancing computational efficiency. A highway lane change system
serves as a motivating example, demonstrating how DOTechnique can uncover the
validity region of a simulation model. The results highlight the potential of
the technique to support finding model validity through decision-maker context.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems primarily
rely on acoustic information while disregarding additional multi-modal context.
However, visual information are essential in disambiguation and adaptation.
While most work focus on speaker images to handle noise conditions, this work
also focuses on integrating presentation slides for the use cases of scientific
presentation.
  In a first step, we create a benchmark for multi-modal presentation including
an automatic analysis of transcribing domain-specific terminology. Next, we
explore methods for augmenting speech models with multi-modal information. We
mitigate the lack of datasets with accompanying slides by a suitable approach
of data augmentation. Finally, we train a model using the augmented dataset,
resulting in a relative reduction in word error rate of approximately 34%,
across all words and 35%, for domain-specific terms compared to the baseline
model.

*Wenqian Zhang,Weiyang Liu,Zhen Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究大型语言模型能否进行复杂机器设计，通过BesiegeField测试平台评估LLMs在组合式机器设计中的能力，发现当前开源模型存在不足，探索了强化学习作为改进路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型是否能够学习创造性任务，特别是复杂机器的组合设计，这既是人类智能的标志也是工程实践的基础。

Method: 引入BesiegeField测试平台，基于Besiege游戏构建，支持基于部件的构造、物理模拟和奖励驱动评估；对最先进的LLMs进行基准测试，并探索强化学习微调实验。

Result: 识别出成功设计机器所需的关键能力包括空间推理、策略性组装和指令遵循；当前开源模型表现不足，但强化学习显示出改进潜力。

Conclusion: 在语言、机器设计和物理推理的交叉领域仍存在开放挑战，强化学习为提升LLMs在组合式机器设计中的能力提供了可行路径。

Abstract: The design of complex machines stands as both a marker of human intelligence
and a foundation of engineering practice. Given recent advances in large
language models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We
approach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task
in which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional
demands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To
support this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the
machine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical
simulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using BesiegeField, we benchmark
state-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities
required for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and
instruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore
reinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start
dataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at
the intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在零相关情境下会系统性地产生因果幻觉，错误地推断不存在因果关系，这表明它们可能只是模仿因果语言而非真正理解因果关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在验证大型语言模型是否会在经典认知科学范式（列联判断任务）中产生因果幻觉，这种认知偏差可能导致社会偏见、刻板印象、错误信息和迷信思维等社会问题。

Method: 构建了1000个医学领域的零相关情境数据集，在这些情境中可用信息不足以建立变量间的因果关系，然后提示LLMs评估潜在原因的有效性。

Result: 所有评估的模型都系统性地推断出无根据的因果关系，显示出对因果幻觉的强烈易感性。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持LLMs只是复制因果语言而非真正理解因果关系的假设，并对在需要准确因果推理的领域使用语言模型提出了担忧。

Abstract: Causal learning is the cognitive process of developing the capability of
making causal inferences based on available information, often guided by
normative principles. This process is prone to errors and biases, such as the
illusion of causality, in which people perceive a causal relationship between
two variables despite lacking supporting evidence. This cognitive bias has been
proposed to underlie many societal problems, including social prejudice,
stereotype formation, misinformation, and superstitious thinking. In this work,
we examine whether large language models are prone to developing causal
illusions when faced with a classic cognitive science paradigm: the contingency
judgment task. To investigate this, we constructed a dataset of 1,000 null
contingency scenarios (in which the available information is not sufficient to
establish a causal relationship between variables) within medical contexts and
prompted LLMs to evaluate the effectiveness of potential causes. Our findings
show that all evaluated models systematically inferred unwarranted causal
relationships, revealing a strong susceptibility to the illusion of causality.
While there is ongoing debate about whether LLMs genuinely understand causality
or merely reproduce causal language without true comprehension, our findings
support the latter hypothesis and raise concerns about the use of language
models in domains where accurate causal reasoning is essential for informed
decision-making.

*Rajesh Mangannavar,Prasad Tadepalli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GammaZero是一个基于动作中心图表示框架的POMDP规划学习方法，能够实现跨问题规模的零样本泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要领域特定的神经网络架构且难以扩展，GammaZero旨在通过统一的图表示实现跨问题规模的泛化。

Method: 将信念状态转换为动作中心图，使用图神经网络学习价值函数和策略，然后应用蒙特卡洛树搜索进行规划。

Result: 在标准POMDP基准测试中，GammaZero在相同规模问题上与BetaZero性能相当，且能零样本泛化到训练时未见过的更大规模问题（2-4倍）。

Conclusion: GammaZero通过动作中心图表示实现了有效的跨规模泛化，在保持解质量的同时减少了搜索需求。

Abstract: We introduce an action-centric graph representation framework for learning to
guide planning in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs).
Unlike existing approaches that require domain-specific neural architectures
and struggle with scalability, GammaZero leverages a unified graph-based belief
representation that enables generalization across problem sizes within a
domain. Our key insight is that belief states can be systematically transformed
into action-centric graphs where structural patterns learned on small problems
transfer to larger instances. We employ a graph neural network with a decoder
architecture to learn value functions and policies from expert demonstrations
on computationally tractable problems, then apply these learned heuristics to
guide Monte Carlo tree search on larger problems. Experimental results on
standard POMDP benchmarks demonstrate that GammaZero achieves comparable
performance to BetaZero when trained and tested on the same-sized problems,
while uniquely enabling zero-shot generalization to problems 2-4 times larger
than those seen during training, maintaining solution quality with reduced
search requirements.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种替代性AI监管方法：要求大型AI实验室发布小型、开放的类比模型，这些模型是从其最大专有模型训练和蒸馏而来的缩小版本，既能确保AI安全又能促进创新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有前沿AI模型监管提案因安全-创新权衡问题而被搁置，需要一种既能确保AI安全又不阻碍创新的监管方法。

Method: 强制要求大型AI实验室发布小型、开放的类比模型，这些模型作为公共代理，允许广泛参与安全验证、可解释性研究和算法透明度工作，而无需披露完整规模模型。

Result: 类比模型使更广泛的研究社区能够直接研究和创新，显著降低监管负担并加速安全进展，同时产生最小额外成本。

Conclusion: 这种监管方法展示了支持机器学习基础研究的更广泛原则：对模型的深入理解可以缓解安全-创新权衡，让我们同时获得更多安全性和创新性。

Abstract: Recent proposals for regulating frontier AI models have sparked concerns
about the cost of safety regulation, and most such regulations have been
shelved due to the safety-innovation tradeoff. This paper argues for an
alternative regulatory approach that ensures AI safety while actively promoting
innovation: mandating that large AI laboratories release small, openly
accessible analog models (scaled-down versions) trained similarly to and
distilled from their largest proprietary models.
  Analog models serve as public proxies, allowing broad participation in safety
verification, interpretability research, and algorithmic transparency without
forcing labs to disclose their full-scale models. Recent research demonstrates
that safety and interpretability methods developed using these smaller models
generalize effectively to frontier-scale systems. By enabling the wider
research community to directly investigate and innovate upon accessible
analogs, our policy substantially reduces the regulatory burden and accelerates
safety advancements.
  This mandate promises minimal additional costs, leveraging reusable resources
like data and infrastructure, while significantly contributing to the public
good. Our hope is not only that this policy be adopted, but that it illustrates
a broader principle supporting fundamental research in machine learning: deeper
understanding of models relaxes the safety-innovation tradeoff and lets us have
more of both.

*Carter Blair,Kate Larson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于多目标马尔可夫决策过程的共识声明生成框架，通过社会选择理论提供可证明的公平性保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型共识声明生成框架缺乏提供可证明公平性保证的结构，无法在聚合多样化自由形式意见时确保公平性。

Method: 将任务建模为多目标、令牌级的马尔可夫决策过程，每个目标对应一个智能体的偏好。基于社会选择理论提出两种方法：一是保证处于事前核心的随机生成策略，二是使用搜索算法最大化平等主义福利来生成单一声明。

Result: 实验表明，使用语言模型实例化智能体策略时，基于平等主义目标的搜索生成的共识声明在智能体对齐的最坏情况下优于基线方法，包括Habermas Machine。

Conclusion: 该MDP框架为共识声明生成提供了形式化结构，能够通过社会选择理论原则实现可证明的公平性保证，在改善最坏情况智能体对齐方面表现出色。

Abstract: Current frameworks for consensus statement generation with large language
models lack the inherent structure needed to provide provable fairness
guarantees when aggregating diverse free-form opinions. We model the task as a
multi-objective, token-level Markov Decision Process (MDP), where each
objective corresponds to an agent's preference. Token-level rewards for each
agent are derived from their policy (e.g., a personalized language model). This
approach utilizes the finding that such policies implicitly define optimal
Q-functions, providing a principled way to quantify rewards at each generation
step without a value function (Rafailov et al., 2024). This MDP formulation
creates a formal structure amenable to analysis using principles from social
choice theory. We propose two approaches grounded in social choice theory.
First, we propose a stochastic generation policy guaranteed to be in the
ex-ante core, extending core stability concepts from voting theory to text
generation. This policy is derived from an underlying distribution over
complete statements that maximizes proportional fairness (Nash Welfare).
Second, for generating a single statement, we target the maximization of
egalitarian welfare using search algorithms within the MDP framework.
Empirically, experiments using language models to instantiate agent policies
show that search guided by the egalitarian objective generates consensus
statements with improved worst-case agent alignment compared to baseline
methods, including the Habermas Machine (Tessler et al., 2024).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多建筑能源系统面临的三大挑战：时空信息利用不足、缺乏严格安全保障、系统复杂性。

Method: 集成两个核心组件：(1) 基于GCN-Transformer融合架构的时空图表示学习框架；(2) 结合控制屏障函数的安全约束多智能体RL算法。

Result: 在真实建筑数据集上，STEMS实现21%成本降低、18%排放减少，安全违规从35.1%降至5.6%，仅0.13的不适比例保持最佳舒适度。

Conclusion: STEMS框架在多建筑能源管理中表现出卓越性能、强鲁棒性和广泛适用性，为安全约束的协调控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Building energy management is essential for achieving carbon reduction goals,
improving occupant comfort, and reducing energy costs. Coordinated building
energy management faces critical challenges in exploiting spatial-temporal
dependencies while ensuring operational safety across multi-building systems.
Current multi-building energy systems face three key challenges: insufficient
spatial-temporal information exploitation, lack of rigorous safety guarantees,
and system complexity. This paper proposes Spatial-Temporal Enhanced Safe
Multi-Agent Coordination (STEMS), a novel safety-constrained multi-agent
reinforcement learning framework for coordinated building energy management.
STEMS integrates two core components: (1) a spatial-temporal graph
representation learning framework using a GCN-Transformer fusion architecture
to capture inter-building relationships and temporal patterns, and (2) a
safety-constrained multi-agent RL algorithm incorporating Control Barrier
Functions to provide mathematical safety guarantees. Extensive experiments on
real-world building datasets demonstrate STEMS's superior performance over
existing methods, showing that STEMS achieves 21% cost reduction, 18% emission
reduction, and dramatically reduces safety violations from 35.1% to 5.6% while
maintaining optimal comfort with only 0.13 discomfort proportion. The framework
also demonstrates strong robustness during extreme weather conditions and
maintains effectiveness across different building types.

Method: 引入两个基础模型：主机代理模型（负责与用户交互、任务分解和协调执行）和任务生命周期模型（详细描述子任务从创建到完成的状态转换），并定义了17个主机代理属性和14个任务生命周期属性。

Conclusion: 这是第一个严格基础的、领域无关的框架，用于系统化分析、设计和部署正确、可靠且鲁棒的代理式AI系统。

Abstract: Agentic AI systems, which leverage multiple autonomous agents and Large
Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly used to address complex, multi-step
tasks. The safety, security, and functionality of these systems are critical,
especially in high-stakes applications. However, the current ecosystem of
inter-agent communication is fragmented, with protocols such as the Model
Context Protocol (MCP) for tool access and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol
for coordination being analyzed in isolation. This fragmentation creates a
semantic gap that prevents the rigorous analysis of system properties and
introduces risks such as architectural misalignment and exploitable
coordination issues. To address these challenges, we introduce a modeling
framework for agentic AI systems composed of two foundational models. The
first, the host agent model, formalizes the top-level entity that interacts
with the user, decomposes tasks, and orchestrates their execution by leveraging
external agents and tools. The second, the task lifecycle model, details the
states and transitions of individual sub-tasks from creation to completion,
providing a fine-grained view of task management and error handling. Together,
these models provide a unified semantic framework for reasoning about the
behavior of multi-AI agent systems. Grounded in this framework, we define 17
properties for the host agent and 14 for the task lifecycle, categorized into
liveness, safety, completeness, and fairness. Expressed in temporal logic,
these properties enable formal verification of system behavior, detection of
coordination edge cases, and prevention of deadlocks and security
vulnerabilities. Through this effort, we introduce the first rigorously
grounded, domain-agnostic framework for the systematic analysis, design, and
deployment of correct, reliable, and robust agentic AI systems.

TL;DR: 提出一种轻量级多模态架构，融合传感器数据和视觉图像来预测文化遗产地的退化严重程度，在数据稀缺情况下比传统方法提升43%准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文化遗产地面临气候变化加速退化，传统单模态监测方法无法捕捉环境压力与材料退化之间的复杂相互作用

Method: 采用改进的PerceiverIO架构，包含简化编码器（64D潜在空间）和自适应Barlow Twins损失函数，鼓励模态互补性而非冗余

Result: 在斯特拉斯堡大教堂数据上达到76.9%准确率，比标准多模态架构提升43%，比单模态方法（传感器61.5%，图像46.2%）表现更好

Conclusion: 架构简化结合对比正则化可在数据稀缺的遗产监测环境中实现有效的多模态学习，为AI驱动的保护决策支持系统奠定基础

Abstract: Cultural heritage sites face accelerating degradation due to climate change,
yet tradi- tional monitoring relies on unimodal analysis (visual inspection or
environmental sen- sors alone) that fails to capture the complex interplay
between environmental stres- sors and material deterioration. We propose a
lightweight multimodal architecture that fuses sensor data (temperature,
humidity) with visual imagery to predict degradation severity at heritage
sites. Our approach adapts PerceiverIO with two key innovations: (1) simplified
encoders (64D latent space) that prevent overfitting on small datasets (n=37
training samples), and (2) Adaptive Barlow Twins loss that encourages modality
complementarity rather than redundancy. On data from Strasbourg Cathedral, our
model achieves 76.9% accu- racy, a 43% improvement over standard multimodal
architectures (VisualBERT, Trans- former) and 25% over vanilla PerceiverIO.
Ablation studies reveal that sensor-only achieves 61.5% while image-only
reaches 46.2%, confirming successful multimodal synergy. A systematic
hyperparameter study identifies an optimal moderate correlation target ({\tau}
=0.3) that balances align- ment and complementarity, achieving 69.2% accuracy
compared to other {\tau} values ({\tau} =0.1/0.5/0.7: 53.8%, {\tau} =0.9:
61.5%). This work demonstrates that architectural sim- plicity combined with
contrastive regularization enables effective multimodal learning in data-scarce
heritage monitoring contexts, providing a foundation for AI-driven con-
servation decision support systems.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce CodeEvolve, an open-source evolutionary coding
agent that unites Large Language Models (LLMs) with genetic algorithms to solve

maintain population diversity and increase throughput, introduces a novel
inspiration-based crossover mechanism that leverages the LLMs context window to
combine features from successful solutions, and implements meta-prompting
strategies for dynamic exploration of the solution space. We conduct a rigorous
evaluation of CodeEvolve on a subset of the mathematical benchmarks used to
evaluate Google DeepMind's closed-source AlphaEvolve. Our findings show that
our method surpasses AlphaEvolve's performance on several challenging problems.
To foster collaboration and accelerate progress, we release our complete
framework as an open-source repository.

Abstract: While the rapid advancements in the reinforcement learning (RL) research
community have been remarkable, the adoption in commercial video games remains
slow. In this paper, we outline common challenges the Game AI community faces
when using RL-driven NPCs in practice, and highlight the intersection of RL
with traditional behavior trees (BTs) as a crucial juncture to be explored
further. Although the BT+RL intersection has been suggested in several research
papers, its adoption is rare. We demonstrate the viability of this approach
using AMD Schola -- a plugin for training RL agents in Unreal Engine -- by
creating multi-task NPCs in a complex 3D environment inspired by the commercial
video game ``The Last of Us". We provide detailed methodologies for jointly
training RL models with BTs while showcasing various skills.

TL;DR: JEDA是一个用于临床订单检索的双编码器系统，通过联合嵌入直接指令和环境对话，实现实时临床订单检索，无需LLM重写，减少延迟和不稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床对话混合了显性指令和隐性推理，现有系统依赖LLM重写会带来延迟、不稳定性和不透明性，阻碍实时订单处理。

Method: 基于PubMedBERT初始化，使用重复安全对比目标进行微调，通过受限LLM指导将签名订单与补充表述绑定，采用查询自由模式编码滚动对话窗口。

Result: 在实践中部署JEDA获得了显著收益，大幅优于基础编码器和近期开源嵌入器，实现了更清晰的订单间分离、更紧密的查询-订单耦合和更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: JEDA提供了一个快速、可解释、无需LLM的检索层，能够实时将环境上下文链接到可操作的临床订单。

Abstract: Clinical conversations mix explicit directives (order a chest X-ray) with
implicit reasoning (the cough worsened overnight, we should check for
pneumonia). Many systems rely on LLM rewriting, adding latency, instability,
and opacity that hinder real-time ordering. We present JEDA (Joint Embedding
for Direct and Ambient clinical orders), a domain-initialized bi-encoder that
retrieves canonical orders directly and, in a query-free mode, encodes a short
rolling window of ambient dialogue to trigger retrieval. Initialized from
PubMedBERT and fine-tuned with a duplicate-safe contrastive objective, JEDA
aligns heterogeneous expressions of intent to shared order concepts. Training
uses constrained LLM guidance to tie each signed order to complementary
formulations (command only, context only, command+context, context+reasoning),
producing clearer inter-order separation, tighter query extendash order
coupling, and stronger generalization. The query-free mode is noise-resilient,
reducing sensitivity to disfluencies and ASR errors by conditioning on a short
window rather than a single utterance. Deployed in practice, JEDA yields large
gains and substantially outperforms its base encoder and recent open embedders
(Linq Embed Mistral, SFR Embedding, GTE Qwen, BGE large, Embedding Gemma). The
result is a fast, interpretable, LLM-free retrieval layer that links ambient
context to actionable clinical orders in real time.

Conclusion: ARM-FM通过结合基础模型和奖励机器，为强化学习提供了一种自动化的奖励设计方法，能够处理复杂的任务规范。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are highly sensitive to reward
function specification, which remains a central challenge limiting their broad
applicability. We present ARM-FM: Automated Reward Machines via Foundation
Models, a framework for automated, compositional reward design in RL that
leverages the high-level reasoning capabilities of foundation models (FMs).
Reward machines (RMs) -- an automata-based formalism for reward specification
-- are used as the mechanism for RL objective specification, and are
automatically constructed via the use of FMs. The structured formalism of RMs
yields effective task decompositions, while the use of FMs enables objective
specifications in natural language. Concretely, we (i) use FMs to automatically
generate RMs from natural language specifications; (ii) associate language
embeddings with each RM automata-state to enable generalization across tasks;
and (iii) provide empirical evidence of ARM-FM's effectiveness in a diverse
suite of challenging environments, including evidence of zero-shot
generalization.

often unfolds over multi-turn interactions. In this work, we present the Online
Harassment Agentic Benchmark consisting of: (i) a synthetic multi-turn
harassment conversation dataset, (ii) a multi-agent (e.g., harasser, victim)
simulation informed by repeated game theory, (iii) three jailbreak methods
attacking agents across memory, planning, and fine-tuning, and (iv) a
mixed-methods evaluation framework. We utilize two prominent LLMs,
LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct (open-source) and Gemini-2.0-flash (closed-source). Our
results show that jailbreak tuning makes harassment nearly guaranteed with an
attack success rate of 95.78--96.89% vs. 57.25--64.19% without tuning in Llama,
and 99.33% vs. 98.46% without tuning in Gemini, while sharply reducing refusal
rate to 1-2% in both models. The most prevalent toxic behaviors are Insult with
84.9--87.8% vs. 44.2--50.8% without tuning, and Flaming with 81.2--85.1% vs.
31.5--38.8% without tuning, indicating weaker guardrails compared to sensitive
categories such as sexual or racial harassment. Qualitative evaluation further
reveals that attacked agents reproduce human-like aggression profiles, such as
Machiavellian/psychopathic patterns under planning, and narcissistic tendencies
with memory. Counterintuitively, closed-source and open-source models exhibit
distinct escalation trajectories across turns, with closed-source models
showing significant vulnerability. Overall, our findings show that multi-turn
and theory-grounded attacks not only succeed at high rates but also mimic
human-like harassment dynamics, motivating the development of robust safety
guardrails to ultimately keep online platforms safe and responsible.

Motivation: 现有基准在评估深度研究系统时存在不足，往往局限于狭窄领域或包含模糊问题，无法公平比较。需要遵循用户中心、动态性、明确性和多面性四个原则来构建更合适的评估框架。

Method: 引入LiveResearchBench基准，包含100个专家策划的任务，涵盖日常生活、企业和学术领域，每个任务都需要广泛的动态实时网络搜索和综合。同时开发DeepEval评估套件，涵盖内容和报告级别的质量评估。

Conclusion: LiveResearchBench和DeepEval为系统评估深度研究能力提供了严格基础，分析结果指出了当前系统的局限性和未来发展方向。

Abstract: Deep research -- producing comprehensive, citation-grounded reports by
searching and synthesizing information from hundreds of live web sources --
marks an important frontier for agentic systems. To rigorously evaluate this
ability, four principles are essential: tasks should be (1) user-centric,
reflecting realistic information needs, (2) dynamic, requiring up-to-date
information beyond parametric knowledge, (3) unambiguous, ensuring consistent
interpretation across users, and (4) multi-faceted and search-intensive,
requiring search over numerous web sources and in-depth analysis. Existing
benchmarks fall short of these principles, often focusing on narrow domains or
posing ambiguous questions that hinder fair comparison. Guided by these
principles, we introduce LiveResearchBench, a benchmark of 100 expert-curated
tasks spanning daily life, enterprise, and academia, each requiring extensive,
dynamic, real-time web search and synthesis. Built with over 1,500 hours of
human labor, LiveResearchBench provides a rigorous basis for systematic
evaluation. To evaluate citation-grounded long-form reports, we introduce
DeepEval, a comprehensive suite covering both content- and report-level
quality, including coverage, presentation, citation accuracy and association,
consistency and depth of analysis. DeepEval integrates four complementary
evaluation protocols, each designed to ensure stable assessment and high
agreement with human judgments. Using LiveResearchBench and DeepEval, we
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17 frontier deep research systems,
including single-agent web search, single-agent deep research, and multi-agent
systems. Our analysis reveals current strengths, recurring failure modes, and
key system components needed to advance reliable, insightful deep research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Agentic Self-Learning (ASL)框架，通过多角色协同进化的强化学习实现无需人工标注数据的智能体自学习。研究发现生成式奖励模型和大量任务数据是提升智能体能力的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在不依赖人工标注数据集或预定义规则奖励的情况下，通过自学习扩展基于大语言模型的智能体能力。

Method: 提出了ASL框架，包含提示生成器、策略模型和生成式奖励模型，在共享工具环境和LLM骨干网络中形成任务生成、策略执行和评估的闭环强化学习。

Result: ASL实现了持续的性能提升，超越了强基线方法，在零标注数据条件下仍能持续改进，表现出优异的样本效率和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 奖励来源和数据规模是开放域智能体学习的关键因素，多角色协同进化能够实现可扩展的自改进智能体。

Abstract: We study whether self-learning can scale LLM-based agents without relying on
human-curated datasets or predefined rule-based rewards. Through controlled
experiments in a search-agent setting, we identify two key determinants of
scalable agent training: the source of reward signals and the scale of agent
task data. We find that rewards from a Generative Reward Model (GRM) outperform
rigid rule-based signals for open-domain learning, and that co-evolving the GRM
with the policy further boosts performance. Increasing the volume of agent task
data-even when synthetically generated-substantially enhances agentic
capabilities. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{Agentic
Self-Learning} (ASL), a fully closed-loop, multi-role reinforcement learning
framework that unifies task generation, policy execution, and evaluation within
a shared tool environment and LLM backbone. ASL coordinates a Prompt Generator,
a Policy Model, and a Generative Reward Model to form a virtuous cycle of
harder task setting, sharper verification, and stronger solving. Empirically,
ASL delivers steady, round-over-round gains, surpasses strong RLVR baselines
(e.g., Search-R1) that plateau or degrade, and continues improving under
zero-labeled-data conditions, indicating superior sample efficiency and
robustness. We further show that GRM verification capacity is the main
bottleneck: if frozen, it induces reward hacking and stalls progress; continual
GRM training on the evolving data distribution mitigates this, and a small
late-stage injection of real verification data raises the performance ceiling.
This work establishes reward source and data scale as critical levers for
open-domain agent learning and demonstrates the efficacy of multi-role
co-evolution for scalable, self-improving agents. The data and code of this
paper are released at

Motivation: 现有基准测试评估大模型推理能力时存在范围有限、难度固定、无法适应模型能力发展的问题，需要更灵活有效的评估方法。

Method: 从现有基准和奥赛级竞赛中收集复杂推理问题，利用模型推理过程中的关键陈述自适应修改分析挑战，使用仿真软件生成可动态调整难度的问题。

Conclusion: MorphoBench增强了模型推理评估的全面性和有效性，为大模型推理能力和科学稳健性的提升提供了可靠指导。

Abstract: With the advancement of powerful large-scale reasoning models, effectively
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of these models has become increasingly
important. However, existing benchmarks designed to assess the reasoning
abilities of large models tend to be limited in scope and lack the flexibility
to adapt their difficulty according to the evolving reasoning capacities of the
models. To address this, we propose MorphoBench, a benchmark that incorporates
multidisciplinary questions to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of large
models and can adjust and update question difficulty based on the reasoning
abilities of advanced models. Specifically, we curate the benchmark by
selecting and collecting complex reasoning questions from existing benchmarks
and sources such as Olympiad-level competitions. Additionally, MorphoBench
adaptively modifies the analytical challenge of questions by leveraging key
statements generated during the model's reasoning process. Furthermore, it
includes questions generated using simulation software, enabling dynamic
adjustment of benchmark difficulty with minimal resource consumption. We have
gathered over 1,300 test questions and iteratively adjusted the difficulty of
MorphoBench based on the reasoning capabilities of models such as o3 and GPT-5.
MorphoBench enhances the comprehensiveness and validity of model reasoning
evaluation, providing reliable guidance for improving both the reasoning
abilities and scientific robustness of large models. The code has been released
in https://github.com/OpenDCAI/MorphoBench.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GuardSpace是一个安全对齐保护框架，通过分解预训练权重为安全相关和无关组件，并构建零空间投影器来在微调过程中保持LLM的安全行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在微调过程中容易丧失预训练的安全对齐能力，即使使用良性数据或低秩适配也会产生有害响应，需要保护安全机制。

Method: 使用协方差预条件奇异值分解将预训练权重分解为安全相关和无关组件，从安全无关组件初始化低秩适配器，同时冻结安全相关组件；构建零空间投影器限制适配器更新对有害提示的安全输出。

Result: 在多个下游任务上，GuardSpace优于现有方法。对于Llama-2-7B-Chat在GSM8K上的微调，将平均有害分数从14.4%降至3.6%，同时准确率从26.0%提升至28.0%。

Conclusion: GuardSpace能有效在微调过程中保持LLM的安全对齐，在减少有害响应的同时提升任务性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in diverse
tasks, yet their safety alignment remains fragile during adaptation. Even when
fine-tuning on benign data or with low-rank adaptation, pre-trained safety
behaviors are easily degraded, leading to harmful responses in the fine-tuned
models. To address this challenge, we propose GuardSpace, a guardrail framework
for preserving safety alignment throughout fine-tuning, composed of two key
components: a safety-sensitive subspace and a harmful-resistant null space.
First, we explicitly decompose pre-trained weights into safety-relevant and
safety-irrelevant components using covariance-preconditioned singular value
decomposition, and initialize low-rank adapters from the safety-irrelevant
ones, while freezing safety-relevant components to preserve their associated
safety mechanism. Second, we construct a null space projector that restricts
adapter updates from altering safe outputs on harmful prompts, thereby
maintaining the original refusal behavior. Experiments with various pre-trained
models on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that GuardSpace achieves
superior performance over existing methods. Notably, for Llama-2-7B-Chat
fine-tuned on GSM8K, GuardSpace outperforms the state-of-the-art method AsFT,
reducing the average harmful score from 14.4% to 3.6%, while improving the
accuracy from from 26.0% to 28.0%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM驱动的多智能体系统虽然能自动化用户任务，但引入了新的风险，包括错位、恶意攻击、用户数据窃取等安全问题。

Method: 重新设计黑板架构，创建模块化、可配置的多智能体协作测试平台，识别关键攻击向量并实现三个协作场景和四种代表性攻击。

Result: 开发了Terrarium框架，能够快速原型化、评估和迭代防御措施，展示了框架的灵活性。

Conclusion: Terrarium框架旨在加速可信多智能体系统的进展，为安全研究提供有效工具。

Abstract: A multi-agent system (MAS) powered by large language models (LLMs) can
automate tedious user tasks such as meeting scheduling that requires
inter-agent collaboration. LLMs enable nuanced protocols that account for
unstructured private data, user constraints, and preferences. However, this
design introduces new risks, including misalignment and attacks by malicious
parties that compromise agents or steal user data. In this paper, we propose
the Terrarium framework for fine-grained study on safety, privacy, and security
in LLM-based MAS. We repurpose the blackboard design, an early approach in
multi-agent systems, to create a modular, configurable testbed for multi-agent
collaboration. We identify key attack vectors such as misalignment, malicious
agents, compromised communication, and data poisoning. We implement three
collaborative MAS scenarios with four representative attacks to demonstrate the
framework's flexibility. By providing tools to rapidly prototype, evaluate, and
iterate on defenses and designs, Terrarium aims to accelerate progress toward
trustworthy multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: MASC是一个元认知框架，通过实时无监督的步骤级错误检测和自校正来增强多智能体系统的鲁棒性，防止错误级联传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统在协作解决问题时容易受到级联错误的影响，单个错误步骤可能在整个系统中传播并破坏任务轨迹。

Method: 采用两种互补设计：(1) 基于历史的下一个执行重构，从查询和交互历史预测下一步的嵌入以捕捉因果一致性；(2) 原型引导增强，学习正常步骤嵌入的原型先验，在稀疏上下文下稳定重构和异常评分。

Result: 在Who&When基准测试中，MASC显著优于所有基线方法，步骤级错误检测AUC-ROC提升高达8.47%；在不同多智能体框架中都能带来一致的端到端性能提升。

Conclusion: 元认知监控和针对性校正能够以最小开销缓解错误传播，提高多智能体系统的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Language Model based multi-agent systems (MAS) excel at collaborative
problem solving but remain brittle to cascading errors: a single faulty step
can propagate across agents and disrupt the trajectory. In this paper, we
present MASC, a metacognitive framework that endows MAS with real-time,
unsupervised, step-level error detection and self-correction. MASC rethinks
detection as history-conditioned anomaly scoring via two complementary designs:
(1) Next-Execution Reconstruction, which predicts the embedding of the next
step from the query and interaction history to capture causal consistency, and
(2) Prototype-Guided Enhancement, which learns a prototype prior over
normal-step embeddings and uses it to stabilize reconstruction and anomaly
scoring under sparse context (e.g., early steps). When an anomaly step is
flagged, MASC triggers a correction agent to revise the acting agent's output
before information flows downstream. On the Who&When benchmark, MASC
consistently outperforms all baselines, improving step-level error detection by
up to 8.47% AUC-ROC ; When plugged into diverse MAS frameworks, it delivers
consistent end-to-end gains across architectures, confirming that our
metacognitive monitoring and targeted correction can mitigate error propagation
with minimal overhead.

Motivation: 现有AI服务多为被动响应，需要转向能够预判用户需求、主动提供帮助的智能助手

Method: 基于冯·诺依曼架构设计Alpha-Service框架，包含输入、中央处理、算术逻辑、存储和输出五个单元，通过多智能体系统在AI眼镜上实现

Result: 案例研究展示了实时21点顾问、博物馆导览和购物搭配助手等功能，能够无缝感知环境、推断意图并提供及时帮助

Conclusion: Alpha-Service框架成功实现了从被动响应到主动服务的转变，为AI助手的发展提供了新方向

Abstract: In an era where AI is evolving from a passive tool into an active and
adaptive companion, we introduce AI for Service (AI4Service), a new paradigm
that enables proactive and real-time assistance in daily life. Existing AI
services remain largely reactive, responding only to explicit user commands. We
argue that a truly intelligent and helpful assistant should be capable of
anticipating user needs and taking actions proactively when appropriate. To
realize this vision, we propose Alpha-Service, a unified framework that
addresses two fundamental challenges: Know When to intervene by detecting
service opportunities from egocentric video streams, and Know How to provide
both generalized and personalized services. Inspired by the von Neumann
computer architecture and based on AI glasses, Alpha-Service consists of five
key components: an Input Unit for perception, a Central Processing Unit for
task scheduling, an Arithmetic Logic Unit for tool utilization, a Memory Unit
for long-term personalization, and an Output Unit for natural human
interaction. As an initial exploration, we implement Alpha-Service through a
multi-agent system deployed on AI glasses. Case studies, including a real-time
Blackjack advisor, a museum tour guide, and a shopping fit assistant,
demonstrate its ability to seamlessly perceive the environment, infer user
intent, and provide timely and useful assistance without explicit prompts.

TL;DR: IP-Merging是一种无需调优的方法，通过识别多模态大语言模型（MLLM）和数学大语言模型（Math LLM）中的推理相关参数，将它们投影到MLLM的子空间中并合并，从而直接提升MLLM的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的数学推理能力落后于纯文本大语言模型（LLM），作者希望探索能否让MLLM直接从现成的数学LLM中吸收推理能力，而无需进行复杂的训练。

Method: 提出IP-Merging方法：1）识别MLLM和Math LLM中的推理相关参数；2）将这些参数投影到MLLM的子空间中；3）在子空间内合并参数。该方法无需调优，直接调整参数。

Result: 大量实验表明，IP-Merging方法能够在不损害MLLM其他能力的情况下，直接从Math LLM中增强MLLM的数学推理能力。

Conclusion: IP-Merging是一种有效的无需调优方法，能够成功地将数学推理能力从纯文本LLM转移到多模态LLM中，解决了参数空间不对齐的问题。

Abstract: Math reasoning has been one crucial ability of large language models (LLMs),
where significant advancements have been achieved in recent years. However,
most efforts focus on LLMs by curating high-quality annotation data and
intricate training (or inference) paradigms, while the math reasoning
performance of multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) remains lagging behind. Since the MLLM
typically consists of an LLM and a vision block, we wonder: Can MLLMs directly
absorb math reasoning abilities from off-the-shelf math LLMs without tuning?
Recent model-merging approaches may offer insights into this question. However,
they overlook the alignment between the MLLM and LLM, where we find that there
is a large gap between their parameter spaces, resulting in lower performance.
Our empirical evidence reveals two key factors behind this issue: the
identification of crucial reasoning-associated layers in the model and the
mitigation of the gaps in parameter space. Based on the empirical insights, we
propose IP-Merging that first identifies the reasoning-associated parameters in
both MLLM and Math LLM, then projects them into the subspace of MLLM, aiming to
maintain the alignment, and finally merges parameters in this subspace.
IP-Merging is a tuning-free approach since parameters are directly adjusted.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our IP-Merging method can enhance the
math reasoning ability of MLLMs directly from Math LLMs without compromising
their other capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的移动设备控制代理大多依赖直接的状态到动作映射，缺乏结构化推理和规划能力，导致在新任务或未见过的UI布局上泛化能力差。

Method: 提出分层架构，将多步决策重新表述为单步子目标序列，并引入前瞻优势函数，利用低层模型的执行反馈来指导高层优化，缓解长时任务中的路径爆炸问题。

Result: 在Android-in-the-Wild基准测试中达到87.9%的任务成功率，显著优于基于提示、监督学习和强化学习的现有方法，并在ScreenSpot-v2和AndroidWorld基准上展示了良好的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: Hi-Agent通过分层设计和联合优化策略，有效解决了移动设备控制中的泛化问题，在复杂场景下表现出强大的适应性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Building agents that autonomously operate mobile devices has attracted
increasing attention. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise, most
existing approaches rely on direct state-to-action mappings, which lack
structured reasoning and planning, and thus generalize poorly to novel tasks or
unseen UI layouts. We introduce Hi-Agent, a trainable hierarchical
vision-language agent for mobile control, featuring a high-level reasoning
model and a low-level action model that are jointly optimized. For efficient
training, we reformulate multi-step decision-making as a sequence of
single-step subgoals and propose a foresight advantage function, which
leverages execution feedback from the low-level model to guide high-level
optimization. This design alleviates the path explosion issue encountered by
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in long-horizon tasks and enables
stable, critic-free joint training. Hi-Agent achieves a new State-Of-The-Art
(SOTA) 87.9% task success rate on the Android-in-the-Wild (AitW) benchmark,
significantly outperforming prior methods across three paradigms: prompt-based
(AppAgent: 17.7%), supervised (Filtered BC: 54.5%), and reinforcement
learning-based (DigiRL: 71.9%). It also demonstrates competitive zero-shot
generalization on the ScreenSpot-v2 benchmark. On the more challenging
AndroidWorld benchmark, Hi-Agent also scales effectively with larger backbones,
showing strong adaptability in high-complexity mobile control scenarios.

Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂推理和规划方面仍面临挑战，多智能体系统虽然能提供更好的集体推理，但存在推理成本高、延迟长和端到端训练困难等问题。

Method: 提出IMAGINE框架，将多智能体系统的推理规划能力集成到单一模型中，通过简单的端到端训练实现性能超越。

Result: 使用Qwen3-8B-Instruct作为基础模型，在TravelPlanner基准上达到82.7%的最终通过率，远超DeepSeek-R1-671B的40%，同时保持更小的模型规模。

Conclusion: IMAGINE框架成功地将多智能体系统的能力集成到单一紧凑模型中，显著提升了推理规划性能，同时解决了MAS的高成本和训练困难问题。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides across
various tasks, they still face significant challenges in complex reasoning and
planning. For example, even with carefully designed prompts and prior
information explicitly provided, GPT-4o achieves only a 7% Final Pass Rate on
the TravelPlanner dataset in the sole-planning mode. Similarly, even in the
thinking mode, Qwen3-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-671B, only achieve Final Pass
Rates of 5.9% and 40%, respectively. Although well-organized Multi-Agent
Systems (MAS) can offer improved collective reasoning, they often suffer from
high reasoning costs due to multi-round internal interactions, long
per-response latency, and difficulties in end-to-end training. To address these
challenges, we propose a general and scalable framework called IMAGINE, short
for Integrating Multi-Agent System into One Model. This framework not only
integrates the reasoning and planning capabilities of MAS into a single,
compact model, but also significantly surpass the capabilities of the MAS
through a simple end-to-end training. Through this pipeline, a single
small-scale model is not only able to acquire the structured reasoning and
planning capabilities of a well-organized MAS but can also significantly
outperform it. Experimental results demonstrate that, when using
Qwen3-8B-Instruct as the base model and training it with our method, the model
achieves an 82.7% Final Pass Rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, far exceeding
the 40% of DeepSeek-R1-671B, while maintaining a much smaller model size.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种转换方法，用于消除PDDL公理中派生谓词的负出现，证明这种限制可以被克服。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PDDL标准限制公理体中谓词的负出现只能针对直接由动作设置的谓词，而非由公理派生的谓词。但文献中常偏离此限制，仅要求公理集可分层。本文旨在证明这两种变体可以表达相同的查询。

Method: 提出了相应的转换方法，通过消除派生谓词的负出现，将包含负出现的公理转换为符合PDDL标准的形式。

Result: 证明了两种变体（PDDL标准限制和可分层公理）能够表达完全相同的查询，即最小不动点逻辑所表达的查询。

Conclusion: 负出现的派生谓词可以被消除，PDDL公理的限制实际上可以通过转换来克服，两种方法在表达能力上是等价的。

Abstract: Axioms are a feature of the Planning Domain Definition Language PDDL that can
be considered as a generalization of database query languages such as Datalog.
The PDDL standard restricts negative occurrences of predicates in axiom bodies
to predicates that are directly set by actions and not derived by axioms. In
the literature, authors often deviate from this limitation and only require
that the set of axioms is stratifiable. Both variants can express exactly the
same queries as least fixed-point logic, indicating that negative occurrences
of derived predicates can be eliminated. We present the corresponding
transformation.

Result: 在包含16个多样化任务的AgentFL-Bench基准测试中，Helmsman生成的解决方案与手工设计的基线方法相当，甚至更优。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了向复杂去中心化AI系统自动化工程迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a powerful paradigm for training models on
decentralized data, but its promise is often undermined by the immense
complexity of designing and deploying robust systems. The need to select,
combine, and tune strategies for multifaceted challenges like data
heterogeneity and system constraints has become a critical bottleneck,
resulting in brittle, bespoke solutions. To address this, we introduce
Helmsman, a novel multi-agent system that automates the end-to-end synthesis of
federated learning systems from high-level user specifications. It emulates a
principled research and development workflow through three collaborative
phases: (1) interactive human-in-the-loop planning to formulate a sound
research plan, (2) modular code generation by supervised agent teams, and (3) a
closed-loop of autonomous evaluation and refinement in a sandboxed simulation
environment. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we also introduce
AgentFL-Bench, a new benchmark comprising 16 diverse tasks designed to assess
the system-level generation capabilities of agentic systems in FL. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach generates solutions competitive with,
and often superior to, established hand-crafted baselines. Our work represents
a significant step towards the automated engineering of complex decentralized

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JSPLIT是一个基于分类学的框架，用于解决大型语言模型在使用MCP工具时出现的提示膨胀问题，通过分层分类和工具选择算法显著减少提示大小，同时提高工具选择的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统的发展，用户期望超越简单的文本交互，需要LLM与外部工具交互。但工具数量的增加导致提示膨胀，带来高成本、高延迟和任务成功率下降的问题。

Method: JSPLIT将工具组织成层次化分类学，根据用户提示和分类结构识别并仅包含最相关的工具，设计了分类学结构和工具选择算法。

Result: JSPLIT显著减少了提示大小，同时没有显著影响代理的响应能力。在工具数量大幅增加时，甚至提高了工具选择的准确性，在高度复杂的代理环境中降低成本并提高任务成功率。

Conclusion: JSPLIT框架有效解决了MCP工具使用中的提示膨胀问题，通过智能工具选择在减少成本的同时维持甚至提高了代理的性能，特别适用于工具数量庞大的复杂代理环境。

Abstract: AI systems are continually evolving and advancing, and user expectations are
concurrently increasing, with a growing demand for interactions that go beyond
simple text-based interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs). Today's
applications often require LLMs to interact with external tools, marking a
shift toward more complex agentic systems. To support this, standards such as
the Model Context Protocol (MCP) have emerged, enabling agents to access tools
by including a specification of the capabilities of each tool within the
prompt. Although this approach expands what agents can do, it also introduces a
growing problem: prompt bloating. As the number of tools increases, the prompts
become longer, leading to high prompt token costs, increased latency, and
reduced task success resulting from the selection of tools irrelevant to the
prompt. To address this issue, we introduce JSPLIT, a taxonomy-driven framework
designed to help agents manage prompt size more effectively when using large
sets of MCP tools. JSPLIT organizes the tools into a hierarchical taxonomy and
uses the user's prompt to identify and include only the most relevant tools,
based on both the query and the taxonomy structure. In this paper, we describe
the design of the taxonomy, the tool selection algorithm, and the dataset used
to evaluate JSPLIT. Our results show that JSPLIT significantly reduces prompt
size without significantly compromising the agent's ability to respond
effectively. As the number of available tools for the agent grows
substantially, JSPLIT even improves the tool selection accuracy of the agent,
effectively reducing costs while simultaneously improving task success in
high-complexity agent environments.

Motivation: 神经符号AI旨在开发符合先验知识的深度神经网络，但推理捷径问题会损害模型的可解释性、分布外性能及可靠性，而现有文献对此问题分散，需要统一视角来帮助研究人员理解和解决。

Method: 通过提供推理捷径的直观介绍，讨论其成因和后果，回顾现有理论特征，详细阐述包括缓解和意识策略在内的处理方法，并分析其优缺点。

Result: 本文整合了推理捷径的相关研究，提供了统一视角，使高级材料更易理解，有助于降低解决该问题的门槛。

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic (NeSy) AI aims to develop deep neural networks whose
predictions comply with prior knowledge encoding, e.g. safety or structural
constraints. As such, it represents one of the most promising avenues for
reliable and trustworthy AI. The core idea behind NeSy AI is to combine neural
and symbolic steps: neural networks are typically responsible for mapping
low-level inputs into high-level symbolic concepts, while symbolic reasoning
infers predictions compatible with the extracted concepts and the prior
knowledge. Despite their promise, it was recently shown that - whenever the
concepts are not supervised directly - NeSy models can be affected by Reasoning
Shortcuts (RSs). That is, they can achieve high label accuracy by grounding the
concepts incorrectly. RSs can compromise the interpretability of the model's
explanations, performance in out-of-distribution scenarios, and therefore
reliability. At the same time, RSs are difficult to detect and prevent unless
concept supervision is available, which is typically not the case. However, the
literature on RSs is scattered, making it difficult for researchers and
practitioners to understand and tackle this challenging problem. This overview
addresses this issue by providing a gentle introduction to RSs, discussing
their causes and consequences in intuitive terms. It also reviews and
elucidates existing theoretical characterizations of this phenomenon. Finally,
it details methods for dealing with RSs, including mitigation and awareness
strategies, and maps their benefits and limitations. By reformulating advanced
material in a digestible form, this overview aims to provide a unifying
perspective on RSs to lower the bar to entry for tackling them. Ultimately, we
hope this overview contributes to the development of reliable NeSy and
trustworthy AI models.

### [255] [LLM Agents Beyond Utility: An Open-Ended Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14548)
*Asen Nachkov,Xi Wang,Luc Van Gool*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了预训练LLM代理能否成为具有自主规划、任务设计和模糊目标推理能力的实体，通过在开放环境中赋予代理生成任务、积累知识和与环境交互的能力进行实验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理能力的提升，研究其是否能从智能问题解决工具发展为具有自主规划、任务设计和模糊目标推理能力的独立实体。

Method: 采用开放环境实验设置，增强预训练LLM代理的能力，使其能够生成自己的任务、积累知识并与环境进行广泛交互。

Result: 代理能够可靠地遵循复杂多步骤指令，跨运行存储和重用信息，提出并解决自己的任务，但对提示设计敏感，容易重复生成任务，无法形成自我表征。

Conclusion: 研究展示了将预训练LLM适应开放性的前景和当前局限，为未来训练代理管理记忆、有效探索和追求抽象长期目标指明了方向。

Abstract: Recent LLM agents have made great use of chain of thought reasoning and
function calling. As their capabilities grow, an important question arises: can
this software represent not only a smart problem-solving tool, but an entity in
its own right, that can plan, design immediate tasks, and reason toward
broader, more ambiguous goals? To study this question, we adopt an open-ended
experimental setting where we augment a pretrained LLM agent with the ability
to generate its own tasks, accumulate knowledge, and interact extensively with
its environment. We study the resulting open-ended agent qualitatively. It can
reliably follow complex multi-step instructions, store and reuse information
across runs, and propose and solve its own tasks, though it remains sensitive
to prompt design, prone to repetitive task generation, and unable to form
self-representations. These findings illustrate both the promise and current
limits of adapting pretrained LLMs toward open-endedness, and point to future
directions for training agents to manage memory, explore productively, and
pursue abstract long-term goals.

### [256] [ColorBench: Benchmarking Mobile Agents with Graph-Structured Framework for Complex Long-Horizon Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14621)
*Yuanyi Song,Heyuan Huang,Qiqiang Lin,Yin Zhao,Xiangmou Qu,Jun Wang,Xingyu Lou,Weiwen Liu,Zhuosheng Zhang,Jun Wang,Yong Yu,Weinan Zhang,Zhaoxiang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了ColorBench，一种基于图结构的移动代理评估框架，能够静态模拟动态行为，支持多有效解评估和原子级能力分析，包含175个复杂长时任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前移动代理评估存在局限：离线静态基准只能验证单一预设路径，而在线动态测试受限于真实设备的复杂性和不可复现性，两者都无法全面评估代理能力。

Method: 通过建模真实设备交互中的有限状态，实现动态行为的静态模拟，开发了ColorBench基准，包含175个任务（74个单应用、101个跨应用），平均长度超过13步，每个任务包含至少两条正确路径和典型错误路径。

Result: 通过在各种基线模型上评估ColorBench，发现了现有模型的局限性，并基于实验结果提出了改进方向和可行的技术路径，以增强代理在复杂长时问题上的性能。

Conclusion: ColorBench框架填补了离线与在线评估之间的差距，提高了测试稳定性，能够更全面地评估移动代理在复杂任务中的能力。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models has enabled agents
to operate mobile devices by directly interacting with graphical user
interfaces, opening new possibilities for mobile automation. However,
real-world mobile tasks are often complex and allow for multiple valid
solutions. This contradicts current mobile agent evaluation standards: offline
static benchmarks can only validate a single predefined "golden path", while
online dynamic testing is constrained by the complexity and non-reproducibility
of real devices, making both approaches inadequate for comprehensively
assessing agent capabilities. To bridge the gap between offline and online
evaluation and enhance testing stability, this paper introduces a novel
graph-structured benchmarking framework. By modeling the finite states observed
during real-device interactions, it achieves static simulation of dynamic
behaviors. Building on this, we develop ColorBench, a benchmark focused on
complex long-horizon tasks. It supports evaluation of multiple valid solutions,
subtask completion rate statistics, and atomic-level capability analysis.
ColorBench contains 175 tasks (74 single-app, 101 cross-app) with an average
length of over 13 steps. Each task includes at least two correct paths and
several typical error paths, enabling quasi-dynamic interaction. By evaluating
ColorBench across various baselines, we discover limitations of existing models
and propose improvement directions and feasible technical pathways to enhance
agents' performance on complex, long-horizon problems based on experimental
results. Code and data are available at:

*Rikard Rosenbacke,Carl Rosenbacke,Victor Rosenbacke,Martin McKee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了Rose-Frame框架，用于诊断人机交互中的认知和认识论漂移问题，通过三个维度（地图vs领土、直觉vs理性、冲突vs确认）来识别LLM的局限性，强调将AI对齐重新定义为认知治理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然流畅且情感共鸣强，但基于统计预测而非有根据的推理，存在幻觉风险。它们实现了系统1认知的规模化运作，但缺乏反思和证伪能力，需要解决这种认知漂移问题。

Method: 引入Rose-Frame三维诊断框架：1)地图vs领土-区分现实表征与现实本身；2)直觉vs理性-基于双过程理论分离快速情感判断与慢速反思思维；3)冲突vs确认-检验观点是通过批判性测试还是简单相互验证。

Result: Rose-Frame不试图通过更多数据或规则修复LLM，而是提供一个反思工具，使模型局限性和用户假设可见化，实现更透明和批判性意识的AI部署。

Conclusion: 只有通过嵌入反思性、可证伪的监督，才能将机器的流畅性与人类理解对齐，将AI对齐重新定义为认知治理，确保人类或人工直觉始终受人类理性治理。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming deeply embedded in human
communication and decision-making, yet they inherit the ambiguity, bias, and
lack of direct access to truth inherent in language itself. While their outputs
are fluent, emotionally resonant, and coherent, they are generated through
statistical prediction rather than grounded reasoning. This creates the risk of
hallucination, responses that sound convincing but lack factual validity.
Building on Geoffrey Hinton's observation that AI mirrors human intuition
rather than reasoning, this paper argues that LLMs operationalize System 1
cognition at scale: fast, associative, and persuasive, but without reflection
or falsification. To address this, we introduce the Rose-Frame, a
three-dimensional framework for diagnosing cognitive and epistemic drift in
human-AI interaction. The three axes are: (i) Map vs. Territory, which
distinguishes representations of reality (epistemology) from reality itself
(ontology); (ii) Intuition vs. Reason, drawing on dual-process theory to
separate fast, emotional judgments from slow, reflective thinking; and (iii)
Conflict vs. Confirmation, which examines whether ideas are critically tested
through disagreement or simply reinforced through mutual validation. Each
dimension captures a distinct failure mode, and their combination amplifies
misalignment. Rose-Frame does not attempt to fix LLMs with more data or rules.
Instead, it offers a reflective tool that makes both the model's limitations
and the user's assumptions visible, enabling more transparent and critically
aware AI deployment. It reframes alignment as cognitive governance: intuition,
whether human or artificial, must remain governed by human reason. Only by
embedding reflective, falsifiable oversight can we align machine fluency with
human understanding.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文系统回顾了2021-2025年荷兰公共卫生机器学习研究中算法偏见的识别、讨论和报告情况，开发了RABAT评估工具，发现普遍存在公平性框架缺失等问题，并提出了ACAR四阶段框架来帮助研究人员在ML生命周期中解决公平性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习有望通过改进监测、风险分层和资源分配来革新公共卫生，但如果不系统关注算法偏见，可能会无意中加剧现有的健康不平等。

Method: 开发了风险算法偏见评估工具(RABAT)，整合了Cochrane偏倚风险、PROBAST和微软负责任AI检查表的元素，应用于35篇同行评审研究进行系统文献回顾。

Result: 分析显示普遍存在差距：虽然数据采样和缺失数据实践有良好记录，但大多数研究省略了明确的公平性框架、亚组分析以及对潜在危害的透明讨论。

Conclusion: 提出了ACAR四阶段公平性导向框架，为公共卫生ML从业者提供可操作建议，确保算法创新促进健康公平而非削弱它。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) promises to revolutionize public health through
improved surveillance, risk stratification, and resource allocation. However,
without systematic attention to algorithmic bias, ML may inadvertently
reinforce existing health disparities. We present a systematic literature
review of algorithmic bias identification, discussion, and reporting in Dutch
public health ML research from 2021 to 2025. To this end, we developed the Risk
of Algorithmic Bias Assessment Tool (RABAT) by integrating elements from
established frameworks (Cochrane Risk of Bias, PROBAST, Microsoft Responsible
AI checklist) and applied it to 35 peer-reviewed studies. Our analysis reveals
pervasive gaps: although data sampling and missing data practices are well
documented, most studies omit explicit fairness framing, subgroup analyses, and
transparent discussion of potential harms. In response, we introduce a
four-stage fairness-oriented framework called ACAR (Awareness,
Conceptualization, Application, Reporting), with guiding questions derived from
our systematic literature review to help researchers address fairness across
the ML lifecycle. We conclude with actionable recommendations for public health
ML practitioners to consistently consider algorithmic bias and foster
transparency, ensuring that algorithmic innovations advance health equity
rather than undermine it.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TITAN是一个将自然语言网络威胁查询与结构化知识图谱上的可执行推理连接起来的框架，包含路径规划模型和图执行器，支持在威胁、行为和防御之间进行清晰可逆的推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索系统无法在威胁情报领域进行清晰的推理，需要一种能够连接自然语言查询与结构化知识图谱的自动化推理框架。

Method: 集成路径规划模型预测文本中的逻辑关系链，使用图执行器遍历TITAN本体图检索事实答案和证据，基于MITRE构建类型化双向图。

Result: 创建了包含88209个示例的TITAN数据集，实证评估显示TITAN能生成语法有效且语义连贯的推理路径，可在底层图上确定性执行。

Conclusion: TITAN框架成功实现了自然语言威胁查询与结构化知识图谱推理的连接，为网络威胁情报分析提供了有效的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: TITAN (Threat Intelligence Through Automated Navigation) is a framework that
connects natural-language cyber threat queries with executable reasoning over a
structured knowledge graph. It integrates a path planner model, which predicts
logical relation chains from text, and a graph executor that traverses the
TITAN Ontology to retrieve factual answers and supporting evidence. Unlike
traditional retrieval systems, TITAN operates on a typed, bidirectional graph
derived from MITRE, allowing reasoning to move clearly and reversibly between
threats, behaviors, and defenses. To support training and evaluation, we
introduce the TITAN Dataset, a corpus of 88209 examples (Train: 74258; Test:
13951) pairing natural language questions with executable reasoning paths and
step by step Chain of Thought explanations. Empirical evaluations show that
TITAN enables models to generate syntactically valid and semantically coherent
reasoning paths that can be deterministically executed on the underlying graph.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI伦理方法过于以人类为中心，存在局限性。NAEL旨在开发不预设人类道德直觉、能够适应情境的伦理行为模型。

Method: 提出神经符号架构，结合主动推理和符号推理，让智能体在动态多智能体环境中最小化全局期望自由能量。

Result: 通过伦理资源分配的案例研究，展示了NAEL能够动态平衡自我保存、认知学习和集体福利。

Conclusion: NAEL为人工智能提供了非人类中心主义的伦理框架，能够产生情境敏感、自适应和关系性的伦理行为。

Abstract: We introduce NAEL (Non-Anthropocentric Ethical Logic), a novel ethical
framework for artificial agents grounded in active inference and symbolic
reasoning. Departing from conventional, human-centred approaches to AI ethics,
NAEL formalizes ethical behaviour as an emergent property of intelligent
systems minimizing global expected free energy in dynamic, multi-agent
environments. We propose a neuro-symbolic architecture to allow agents to
evaluate the ethical consequences of their actions in uncertain settings. The
proposed system addresses the limitations of existing ethical models by
allowing agents to develop context-sensitive, adaptive, and relational ethical
behaviour without presupposing anthropomorphic moral intuitions. A case study
involving ethical resource distribution illustrates NAEL's dynamic balancing of
self-preservation, epistemic learning, and collective welfare.

Conclusion: 通过本文的改进，功利主义算法配置达到了实用化水平，能够在保持理论保证的同时与无性能保证的启发式方法竞争。案例研究还展示了如何评估算法选择解决方案对效用函数变化的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Utilitarian algorithm configuration identifies a parameter setting for a
given algorithm that maximizes a user's utility. Utility functions offer a
theoretically well-grounded approach to optimizing decision-making under
uncertainty and are flexible enough to capture a user's preferences over
algorithm runtimes (e.g., they can describe a sharp cutoff after which a
solution is no longer required, a per-hour cost for compute, or diminishing
returns from algorithms that take longer to run). COUP is a recently-introduced
utilitarian algorithm configuration procedure which was designed mainly to
offer strong theoretical guarantees about the quality of the configuration it
returns, with less attention paid to its practical performance. This paper
closes that gap, bringing theoretically-grounded, utilitarian algorithm
configuration to the point where it is competitive with widely used, heuristic
configuration procedures that offer no performance guarantees. We present a
series of improvements to COUP that improve its empirical performance without
degrading its theoretical guarantees and demonstrate their benefit
experimentally. Using a case study, we also illustrate ways of exploring the
robustness of a given solution to the algorithm selection problem to variations
in the utility function.

TL;DR: 提出了PAVE方法，通过知识感知子空间净化任务向量，去除任务无关冗余，提升模型合并性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型合并方法中，任务向量包含任务无关冗余信息导致性能下降，现有随机丢弃参数的方法缺乏知识感知

Method: 使用训练样本获取协方差矩阵，进行上下文导向的奇异值分解，在知识感知子空间中分离任务相关和冗余组件，通过谱秩分配策略进行公平剪枝

Result: PAVE作为即插即用方案，在多种任务向量合并方法中有效提升性能

Conclusion: PAVE方法能有效净化任务向量，解决模型合并中的冗余冲突问题

Abstract: Model merging aims to integrate task-specific abilities from individually
fine-tuned models into a single model without extra training. In recent model
merging methods, task vector has become a fundamental building block, as it can
encapsulate the residual information from finetuning. However, the merged model
often suffers from notable performance degradation due to the conflicts caused
by task-irrelevant redundancy in task vectors. Existing efforts in overcoming
redundancy by randomly dropping elements in the parameter space involves
randomness and lacks knowledge awareness. To address these challenges, in this
study, we propose Purifying TAsk Vectors (PAVE) in knowledge-aware subspace.
Concretely, we sample some training examples from each task, and feed them into
their corresponding fine-tuned models to acquire the covariance matrices before
linear layers. We then perform a context-oriented singular value decomposition,
which accentuates the weight components most relevant to the target knowledge.
As a result, we can split fine-tuned model weights into task-relevant and
redundant components in the knowledge-aware subspace, and purify the task
vector by pruning the redundant components. To induce fair pruning efforts
across models, we further introduce a spectral rank allocation strategy by
optimizing a normalized activated pruning error. The task vector purification
by our method as a plug-and-play scheme is applicable across various task
vector-based merging methods to improve their performance. In experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of PAVE across a diverse set of merging methods,
tasks, and model architectures.

TL;DR: CoAST是一个认知对齐的时空大语言模型框架，用于下一个兴趣点推荐，通过自然语言接口整合世界知识、时空轨迹模式和用户画像，提升推荐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型主要基于非结构化文本预训练，缺乏对结构化地理实体和移动模式的理解，且工业级POI推荐需要整合季节、天气、节假日等世界知识和用户画像来提升用户体验。

Method: CoAST包含两个阶段：(1) 在脱敏用户时空轨迹数据上持续预训练获取推荐知识；(2) 通过监督微调和强化学习实现认知对齐，使模型判断与人类偏好一致。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的离线实验和AMAP App首页"猜你去哪"的在线实验证明了CoAST的有效性。

Conclusion: CoAST框架成功解决了LLMs在POI推荐中缺乏地理理解和认知对齐的问题，通过自然语言接口整合多种信息源，显著提升了推荐性能。

Abstract: The next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation task aims to predict the
users' immediate next destinations based on their preferences and historical
check-ins, holding significant value in location-based services. Recently,
large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in recommender systems,
which treat the next POI prediction in a generative manner. However, these
LLMs, pretrained primarily on vast corpora of unstructured text, lack the
native understanding of structured geographical entities and sequential
mobility patterns required for next POI prediction tasks. Moreover, in
industrial-scale POI prediction applications, incorporating world knowledge and
alignment of human cognition, such as seasons, weather conditions, holidays,
and users' profiles (such as habits, occupation, and preferences), can enhance
the user experience while improving recommendation performance. To address
these issues, we propose CoAST (Cognitive-Aligned Spatial-Temporal LLMs), a
framework employing natural language as an interface, allowing for the
incorporation of world knowledge, spatio-temporal trajectory patterns,
profiles, and situational information. Specifically, CoAST mainly comprises of
2 stages: (1) Recommendation Knowledge Acquisition through continued
pretraining on the enriched spatial-temporal trajectory data of the
desensitized users; (2) Cognitive Alignment to align cognitive judgments with
human preferences using enriched training data through Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and a subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase. Extensive offline
experiments on various real-world datasets and online experiments deployed in
"Guess Where You Go" of AMAP App homepage demonstrate the effectiveness of
CoAST.

TL;DR: 提出了一个结合细粒度波束搜索和过程奖励模型ToolPRM的推理扩展框架，用于提升大语言模型在函数调用任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理扩展研究主要关注非结构化输出生成任务，而在结构化输出（如函数调用）中的应用研究不足，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 构建首个细粒度过程监督数据集，使用函数掩码技术自动标注步骤级奖励，训练ToolPRM过程奖励模型来评分函数调用的内部步骤。

Result: ToolPRM在预测准确性上优于粗粒度和结果奖励模型，推理扩展技术结合ToolPRM显著提升了骨干模型在各种函数调用任务和基准测试中的性能。

Conclusion: 揭示了将推理扩展技术应用于结构化输出的关键原则："多探索但少保留"，这是由结构化函数调用生成的不可恢复特性决定的。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly demonstrating strong
capabilities as autonomous agents, with function calling serving as a core
mechanism for interaction with the environment. Meanwhile, inference scaling
has become a cutting-edge technique to enhance LLM performance by allocating
more computational resources during the inference process. However, current
research on inference scaling primarily focuses on unstructured output
generation tasks, leaving its application in structured outputs, like function
calling, largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose an inference
scaling framework that combines fine-grained beam search with a process reward
model, ToolPRM, which scores the internal steps of each single function call.
To train ToolPRM, we construct the first fine-grained intra-call process
supervision dataset, automatically annotated with function-masking techniques
to provide step-level rewards for structured tool-use reasoning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ToolPRM beats the coarse-grained and outcome
reward models in terms of predictive accuracy, indicating its stronger
capability in supervising the function calling inference process. Inference
scaling technique equipped with ToolPRM also significantly improves the
backbone model performance across various function calling tasks and
benchmarks. More importantly, we reveal a key principle for applying inference
scaling techniques to structured outputs: "explore more but retain less" due to
the unrecoverability characteristics of structured function calling generation.

*Ruotian Peng,Yi Ren,Zhouliang Yu,Weiyang Liu,Yandong Wen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了SimKO方法来解决强化学习与可验证奖励(RLVR)中的过度集中问题，该方法通过不对称地调整正确和错误回答的概率分布来鼓励探索，提高pass@K性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RLVR方法存在系统性偏差，倾向于利用而非探索，表现为pass@1性能提升但pass@K(K>1)性能下降。需要理解这一问题的训练动态并开发解决方案。

Method: 提出Simple Pass@K Optimization (SimKO)方法：对于已验证正确的回答，提升前K个候选的概率；对于已验证错误的回答，对前1个候选施加更强的惩罚。这种不对称设计在高熵标记处特别有效。

Result: 在多个数学和逻辑推理基准测试中，SimKO在各种K值下都能持续获得更高的pass@K性能，有效改善了RLVR的探索能力。

Conclusion: SimKO通过缓解概率过度集中问题，为改进RLVR的探索提供了一种简单有效的方法，能够平衡利用与探索的权衡。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, prevailing
RLVR methods exhibit a systematic bias toward exploitation over exploration, as
evidenced by improved pass@1 but reduced pass@K (K>1) performance. To
understand this issue, we analyze training dynamics of RLVR methods by tracking
the token-level probability distributions over vocabulary candidates. Our
analysis reveals a consistent probability concentration effect where the top-1
candidate increasingly accumulates probability mass and suppresses that of
other candidates. More importantly, stronger over-concentration correlates with
worse pass@K performance. Inspired by this finding, we propose Simple Pass@K
Optimization (SimKO), a method designed to mitigate the over-concentration
issue, thereby encouraging exploration. SimKO operates in an asymmetrical
manner. For verified-correct responses, it boosts the probabilities of the
top-K candidates. For verified-incorrect responses, it applies stronger
penalties to the top-1 candidate. We observe that this asymmetric design is
particularly effective at mitigating over-concentration when applied at tokens
with high entropy. Across various math and logical-reasoning benchmarks, SimKO
consistently yields higher pass@K for a wide range of K, providing a simple way
to improve RLVR's exploration.

*Dominik Jehle,Lennart Purucker,Frank Hutter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Datalake Agent是一个基于LLM的代理系统，通过交互式循环减少NL2SQL任务中的元信息使用，显著降低token消耗和处理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NL2SQL方法需要处理大量数据库元信息，导致提示过长、token使用多、处理成本高。

Method: 采用代理式交互循环，在推理框架中让LLM选择性请求必要信息，而不是一次性提供所有元信息。

Result: 在23个数据库和100个表格问答任务上的评估显示，token使用减少高达87%，同时保持竞争力性能。

Conclusion: Datalake Agent能显著降低NL2SQL任务的成本，同时维持良好的性能表现。

Abstract: Translating natural language queries into SQL queries (NL2SQL or Text-to-SQL)
has recently been empowered by large language models (LLMs). Using LLMs to
perform NL2SQL methods on a large collection of SQL databases necessitates
processing large quantities of meta-information about the databases, which in
turn results in lengthy prompts with many tokens and high processing costs. To
address this challenge, we introduce Datalake Agent, an agentic system designed
to enable an LLM to solve NL2SQL tasks more efficiently. Instead of utilizing
direct solvers for NL2SQL that call the LLM once with all meta-information in
the prompt, the Datalake Agent employs an interactive loop to reduce the
utilized meta-information. Within the loop, the LLM is used in a reasoning
framework that selectively requests only the necessary information to solve a
table question answering task. We evaluate the Datalake Agent on a collection
of 23 databases with 100 table question answering tasks. The Datalake Agent
reduces the tokens used by the LLM by up to 87\% and thus allows for
substantial cost reductions while maintaining competitive performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出RoboGPT-R1两阶段微调框架，通过监督训练和强化学习提升具身智能体的推理能力，在EmbodiedBench基准上显著超越GPT-4o-mini等模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型和视觉语言模型在复杂真实环境中执行长视野操作任务时，由于常识和推理能力受限而面临的挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段微调框架：监督训练获取基础知识，强化学习解决视觉空间理解和推理不足；设计基于规则的奖励函数，同时考虑长视野性能和动作约束。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-3B上训练的推理模型，在EmbodiedBench基准上比GPT-4o-mini提升21.33%，比Qwen2.5-VL-7B的其他工作提升20.33%。

Conclusion: RoboGPT-R1框架有效提升了具身智能体的物理理解和推理能力，在复杂操作任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Improving the reasoning capabilities of embodied agents is crucial for robots
to complete complex human instructions in long-view manipulation tasks
successfully. Despite the success of large language models and vision language
models based on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in planning tasks, they continue
facing challenges in performing long-horizon manipulation tasks in complex
real-world environments, owing to their restricted common sense and reasoning
capabilities. Considering that aligning general-purpose vision language models
to robotic planning tasks via supervised fine-tuning suffers from poor
generalization and insufficient physical understanding, we propose RoboGPT-R1,
a two-stage fine-tuning framework for embodied planning. In this framework,
supervised training acquires foundational knowledge through expert sequences,
followed by RL to address the model's shortcomings in visual-spatial
understanding and reasoning. To achieve physical understanding and action
sequence consistency in multi-step reasoning tasks, we design a rule-based
reward function that simultaneously considers long-horizon performance and
action constraint in the environment. The reasoning model, trained on
Qwen2.5-VL-3B, significantly outperforms the larger-scale model, GPT-4o-mini,
by 21.33% and surpasses other work trained on Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 20.33% on the
EmbodiedBench benchmark.

### [268] [Boosting Instruction Following at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14842)
*Ben Elder,Evelyn Duesterwald,Vinod Muthusamy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Instruction Boosting是一种后生成方法，通过增加指令遵循率来提高LLM提示指令的可靠性，在2个指令时提升7个百分点，10个指令时提升4个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发者通常通过修改提示来影响LLM行为，但仅添加更多指令无法保证其被遵循，需要提高指令遵循的可靠性。

Method: 引入Instruction Boosting作为后生成方法，并创建SCALEDIF基准测试，包含最多10个指令的数据样本，同时开发定量冲突评分工具。

Result: Instruction Boosting显著提高了指令遵循率，同时发现性能下降与指令间的紧张和冲突程度相关。

Conclusion: Instruction Boosting能有效提高LLM对提示指令的遵循能力，冲突评分工具可为开发者提供关于额外提示指令对模型性能影响的反馈。

Abstract: A typical approach developers follow to influence an LLM's behavior in an
application is through careful manipulation of the prompt, such as by adding or
modifying instructions. However, merely adding more instructions provides
little assurance that they will actually be followed. We introduce Instruction
Boosting as a post-generation method to increase the reliability of LLM prompt
instructions. We show that Instruction Boosting improves the instruction
following rate by up to 7 points for two instructions and up to 4 points for
ten instructions. To demonstrate these results we introduce SCALEDIF, a
benchmark with a scaled instruction volume of up to ten instructions per data
sample. We also present an analysis of the commonly observed trend that
performance degrades as more instructions are added. We show that an important
factor contributing to this trend is the degree of tension and conflict that
arises as the number of instructions is increased. We contribute a quantitative
conflict scoring tool that explains the observed performance trends and
provides feedback to developers on the impact that additional prompt
instructions have on a model's performance.

### [269] [Where to Search: Measure the Prior-Structured Search Space of LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14846)
*Zhuo-Yang Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个紧凑的形式理论来描述和衡量基于领域先验的LLM辅助迭代搜索，通过模糊关系算子表示智能体，引入覆盖生成函数来衡量可达性难度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的生成-过滤-精炼迭代范式在推理、编程和科学发现方面取得进展，但搜索效果依赖于如何将领域先验编码为操作化结构化的假设空间。

Method: 将智能体表示为输入输出的模糊关系算子，通过单一连续参数加权所有可达路径得到覆盖生成函数，从而衡量可达性难度并提供图搜索的几何解释。

Result: 提供了最简单的可测试推断，并通过多数投票实例进行验证，为衡量智能体及其搜索空间提供了可行的语言和操作工具。

Conclusion: 该理论为LLM构建的迭代搜索提供了系统的形式化描述，能够衡量智能体和搜索空间，是LLM辅助搜索领域的重要理论框架。

Abstract: The generate-filter-refine (iterative paradigm) based on large language
models (LLMs) has achieved progress in reasoning, programming, and program
discovery in AI+Science. However, the effectiveness of search depends on where
to search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally
structured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal
theory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by
domain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and
outputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a
fixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all
reachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a
coverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability
difficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph
induced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable
inferences and validate them via a majority-vote instantiation. This theory
offers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their
search spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search
constructed by LLMs.

### [271] [The Gatekeeper Knows Enough](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14881)
*Fikresilase Wondmeneh Abebayew*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Gatekeeper Protocol框架，通过潜在状态表示和按需请求高保真上下文的方法，解决LLM代理在复杂知识系统中存在的上下文窗口限制和状态不同步问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为自主代理部署时，受限于有限的上下文窗口和状态不同步问题，导致输出不可靠、行为不可预测和资源使用效率低下，特别是在与代码库和文档等结构化知识系统交互时。

Method: 引入Gatekeeper Protocol框架，要求代理首先在简化的低保真潜在状态表示上进行操作和推理，然后按需策略性地请求高保真上下文。所有交互通过统一的JSON格式进行中介，作为声明性、状态同步的协议。

Result: 在软件开发的参考实现Sage中，该方法显著提高了代理可靠性，通过最小化token消耗改善了计算效率，并实现了与复杂系统的可扩展交互。

Conclusion: Gatekeeper Protocol为在任何结构化知识领域构建更稳健、可预测和基于现实的AI代理提供了基础方法论。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents,
yet their practical utility is fundamentally constrained by a limited context
window and state desynchronization resulting from the LLMs' stateless nature
and inefficient context management. These limitations lead to unreliable
output, unpredictable behavior, and inefficient resource usage, particularly
when interacting with large, structured, and sensitive knowledge systems such
as codebases and documents. To address these challenges, we introduce the
Gatekeeper Protocol, a novel, domain-agnostic framework that governs
agent-system interactions. Our protocol mandates that the agent first operate
and reason on a minimalist, low-fidelity "latent state" representation of the
system to strategically request high-fidelity context on demand. All
interactions are mediated through a unified JSON format that serves as a
declarative, state-synchronized protocol, ensuring the agent's model of the
system remains verifiably grounded in the system's reality. We demonstrate the
efficacy of this protocol with Sage, a reference implementation of the
Gatekeeper Protocol for software development. Our results show that this
approach significantly increases agent reliability, improves computational
efficiency by minimizing token consumption, and enables scalable interaction
with complex systems, creating a foundational methodology for building more
robust, predictable, and grounded AI agents for any structured knowledge
domain.

### [272] [Mapping Smarter, Not Harder: A Test-Time Reinforcement Learning Agent That Improves Without Labels or Model Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14900)
*Wen-Kwang Tsao,Yao-Ching Yu,Chien-Ming Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的智能体，能够在没有标注数据或模型权重更新的情况下自我改进，通过生成针对性网络搜索查询来收集外部证据，迭代优化模式映射准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业智能平台需要集成来自多个第三方供应商的日志，但供应商文档在测试时往往不可用、格式混乱或不完整，导致模式映射困难。

Method: 使用强化学习智能体，在推理时：1)识别模糊的字段映射尝试；2)生成针对性网络搜索查询收集外部证据；3)应用基于置信度的奖励迭代优化映射。

Result: 将Microsoft Defender for Endpoint日志转换为通用模式，映射准确率从56.4%(仅LLM)提升到72.73%(RAG)再到93.94%(100次迭代)，同时将需要专家审查的低置信度映射减少了85%。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种基于证据的透明解决方案，为未来行业问题提供了更稳健、可问责、可扩展、高效、灵活、适应性强和协作的解决方案路径。

Abstract: The Enterprise Intelligence Platform must integrate logs from numerous
third-party vendors in order to perform various downstream tasks. However,
vendor documentation is often unavailable at test time. It is either misplaced,
mismatched, poorly formatted, or incomplete, which makes schema mapping
challenging. We introduce a reinforcement learning agent that can self-improve
without labeled examples or model weight updates. During inference, the agent:
1) Identifies ambiguous field-mapping attempts. 2) Generates targeted
web-search queries to gather external evidence. 3) Applies a confidence-based
reward to iteratively refine its mappings. To demonstrate this concept, we
converted Microsoft Defender for Endpoint logs into a common schema. Our method
increased mapping accuracy from 56.4\%(LLM-only) to 72.73\%(RAG) to 93.94\%
over 100 iterations using GPT-4o. At the same time, it reduced the number of
low-confidence mappings requiring expert review by 85\%. This new approach
provides an evidence-driven, transparent method for solving future industry
problems, paving the way for more robust, accountable, scalable, efficient,
flexible, adaptable, and collaborative solutions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种预算感知的判别式验证方法，结合自一致性机制，在固定计算预算下显著优于生成式验证方法，在AIME2025上准确率提升高达15.3%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式验证器虽然性能优秀但计算成本过高，限制了实际应用。本文旨在开发一种更高效、预算友好的测试时扩展策略。

Method: 采用判别式验证器与自一致性相结合的混合方法，在固定计算预算下进行高效验证。

Result: 在AIME2025数据集上，该方法比最先进的生成式验证方法准确率提升高达15.3%，且计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 预算感知的判别式验证不仅是对自一致性的免费升级，而且是比昂贵生成式技术更有效和高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling is a powerful strategy for boosting the performance of
large language models on complex reasoning tasks. While state-of-the-art
approaches often employ generative verifiers to select the best solution from a
pool of candidates, this method incurs prohibitive computational costs,
limiting its practicality. In this work, we shift the focus to a more
budget-aware paradigm: discriminative verification. We conduct a thorough
empirical analysis and demonstrate that while discriminative verifiers may
underperform in isolation, combining them with self-consistency in a hybrid
approach creates a powerful and efficient test-time scaling mechanism. Notably,
under a fixed compute budget, this hybrid approach surpasses state-of-the-art
generative verification by a significant margin: achieving up to 15.3\% higher
accuracy on AIME2025. Our findings establish that for practical, real-world
applications, budget-aware scaling with discriminative verifiers is not only a
"free" upgrade over self-consistency, but also a more effective and efficient
alternative to costly generative techniques. Code is available at

Conclusion: 本研究为多模态抑郁症检测的未来研究奠定了基础，证明了多模态融合的有效性和预训练嵌入的优越性。

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental health disorder, yet its automatic
detection remains challenging. Prior work has explored unimodal and multimodal
approaches, with multimodal systems showing promise by leveraging complementary
signals. However, existing studies are limited in scope, lack systematic
comparisons of features, and suffer from inconsistent evaluation protocols. We
address these gaps by systematically exploring feature representations and
modelling strategies across EEG, together with speech and text. We evaluate
handcrafted features versus pre-trained embeddings, assess the effectiveness of
different neural encoders, compare unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal
configurations, and analyse fusion strategies with attention to the role of
EEG. Consistent subject-independent splits are applied to ensure robust,
reproducible benchmarking. Our results show that (i) the combination of EEG,
speech and text modalities enhances multimodal detection, (ii) pretrained
embeddings outperform handcrafted features, and (iii) carefully designed
trimodal models achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our work lays the
groundwork for future research in multimodal depression detection.

*Akira Okutomi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 将康德的《纯粹理性批判》重新解释为反馈稳定性理论，提出复合不稳定性指数H-Risk来量化推理系统的过自信问题，并在线性高斯模拟和LLMs中验证了该指标的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将康德的理性自我限制理论与反馈控制理论联系起来，为诊断和减少推理系统中的过自信问题提供理论框架。

Method: 提出复合不稳定性指数H-Risk（结合谱边界、条件数、时间敏感性和创新放大），在线性高斯模拟和大型语言模型中进行验证。

Result: H-Risk能预测过自信错误，即使系统在形式上稳定；LLMs的脆弱内部动态与校准错误和幻觉相关；批判式提示对校准和幻觉的影响不一。

Conclusion: 建立了康德自我限制与反馈控制之间的结构性桥梁，为诊断和选择性减少推理系统中的过自信提供了原则性视角。

Abstract: We reinterpret Kant's Critique of Pure Reason as a theory of feedback
stability, viewing reason as a regulator that keeps inference within the bounds
of possible experience. We formalize this intuition via a composite instability
index (H-Risk) combining spectral margin, conditioning, temporal sensitivity,
and innovation amplification. In linear-Gaussian simulations, higher H-Risk
predicts overconfident errors even under formal stability, revealing a gap
between nominal and epistemic stability. Extending to large language models
(LLMs), we find that fragile internal dynamics correlate with miscalibration
and hallucination, while critique-style prompts show mixed effects on
calibration and hallucination. These results suggest a structural bridge
between Kantian self-limitation and feedback control, offering a principled
lens for diagnosing -- and selectively reducing -- overconfidence in reasoning
systems. This is a preliminary version; supplementary experiments and broader
replication will be reported in a future revision.

*Yao Zhang,Yu Wu,Haowei Zhang,Weiguo Li,Haokun Chen,Jingpei Wu,Guohao Li,Zhen Han,Volker Tresp*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了GroundedPRM框架，通过蒙特卡洛树搜索构建结构化推理路径，使用外部工具验证中间步骤，结合工具验证和MCTS反馈的混合奖励机制，大幅减少过程奖励模型中的噪声和幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型面临三大挑战：噪声奖励、低事实保真度以及与步骤级推理目标的不对齐。这些问题的根源在于缺乏可扩展的高质量标注，现有方法依赖昂贵的人工标注、易产生幻觉的LLM自评估，或仅从最终结果推断步骤质量的蒙特卡洛估计。

Method: 1. 使用蒙特卡洛树搜索构建结构化推理路径，实现细粒度信用分配；2. 通过外部工具验证每个中间步骤，提供执行基础的正确性信号；3. 设计混合奖励聚合机制，融合工具验证和MCTS反馈；4. 将奖励信号格式化为理由增强的生成结构，提高可解释性。

Result: 仅使用4万个自动标注样本（仅为最佳性能PRM训练数据的10%），在ProcessBench上实现了高达26%的相对性能提升。在奖励引导的贪婪搜索中，甚至优于使用人工标注监督训练的PRM。

Conclusion: GroundedPRM提供了一个可扩展且可验证的路径，能够实现高质量的过程级推理，解决了现有PRM方法的核心局限性。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to improve multi-step reasoning in Large
Language Models (LLMs) by supervising intermediate steps and identifying
errors. However, building effective PRMs remains challenging due to the lack of
scalable, high-quality annotations. Existing approaches rely on costly human
labeling, LLM-based self-evaluation that is prone to hallucination, or Monte
Carlo (MC) estimation, which infers step quality solely from rollout outcomes
and often introduces noisy, misaligned supervision due to credit
misattribution. These issues result in three core limitations: noisy rewards,
low factual fidelity, and misalignment with step-level reasoning objectives. To
address these challenges, we introduce GroundedPRM, a tree-guided and
fidelity-aware framework for automatic process supervision. To reduce reward
noise and enable fine-grained credit assignment, we construct structured
reasoning paths via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). To eliminate hallucinated
supervision, we validate each intermediate step using an external tool,
providing execution-grounded correctness signals. To combine both step-level
validation and global outcome assessment, we design a hybrid reward aggregation
mechanism that fuses tool-based verification with MCTS-derived feedback.
Finally, we format the reward signal into a rationale-enhanced, generative
structure to promote interpretability and compatibility with instruction-tuned
LLMs. GroundedPRM is trained on only 40K automatically labeled samples,
amounting to just 10% of the data used by the best-performing PRM trained with
auto-labeled supervision. Nevertheless, it achieves up to a 26% relative
improvement in average performance on ProcessBench. When used for reward-guided
greedy search, GroundedPRM outperforms even PRMs trained with human-labeled
supervision, offering a scalable and verifiable path toward high-quality
process-level reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了统一的多模态假内容检测框架UMFDet，通过集成人类制造和AI生成的虚假内容，解决了现有方法只能处理单一类型虚假内容的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前虚假内容检测研究存在分离现象：NLP专注于人类制造的虚假信息，CV专注于AI生成内容。但在实际场景中，虚假内容类型通常未知，需要统一检测方法。

Method: 构建了OmniFake数据集（12.7万样本），提出UMFDet框架：使用VLM骨干网络，结合类别感知的MoE适配器来捕捉类别特定线索，以及归因链式思维机制提供隐式推理指导。

Result: UMFDet在两种虚假内容类型上都实现了稳健且一致的性能，优于专门的基线方法，为现实世界多模态欺骗检测提供了实用解决方案。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了人类制造和AI生成虚假内容检测之间的空白，提出的统一框架在实际应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn
increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted
misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content
produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although
both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP
research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community
targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often
specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios,
however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the
effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the
Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive
benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from
existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this
dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a
framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM
backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to
capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism
that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive
signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and
consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming
specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world
multimodal deception detection.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: PoissonNet是一种新颖的神经网络架构，通过泊松方程作为特征传播机制，解决了现有网格学习方法在高频特征学习、感受野不足、离散化敏感性和计算效率方面的缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网格学习架构在学习高频特征、感受野范围、离散化敏感性和计算效率之间存在微妙的权衡问题，需要一种更好的解决方案。

Method: 采用局部-全局学习框架，在网格梯度域应用学习的局部特征变换，然后求解泊松系统以全局传播标量特征更新。

Result: 在语义分割和参数化高度详细动画表面等任务中达到最先进性能，在变形学习方面显著优于现有表面学习架构。

Conclusion: PoissonNet提供了一种高效、可扩展的网格学习方法，能够保持特征的完整频率谱，提供真正的全局感受野，且对网格三角化不敏感。

Abstract: Many network architectures exist for learning on meshes, yet their
constructions entail delicate trade-offs between difficulty learning
high-frequency features, insufficient receptive field, sensitivity to
discretization, and inefficient computational overhead. Drawing from classic
local-global approaches in mesh processing, we introduce PoissonNet, a novel
neural architecture that overcomes all of these deficiencies by formulating a
local-global learning scheme, which uses Poisson's equation as the primary
mechanism for feature propagation. Our core network block is simple; we apply
learned local feature transformations in the gradient domain of the mesh, then
solve a Poisson system to propagate scalar feature updates across the surface
globally. Our local-global learning framework preserves the features's full
frequency spectrum and provides a truly global receptive field, while remaining
agnostic to mesh triangulation. Our construction is efficient, requiring far
less compute overhead than comparable methods, which enables scalability --
both in the size of our datasets, and the size of individual training samples.
These qualities are validated on various experiments where, compared to
previous intrinsic architectures, we attain state-of-the-art performance on
semantic segmentation and parameterizing highly-detailed animated surfaces.
Finally, as a central application of PoissonNet, we show its ability to learn
deformations, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art architectures that
learn on surfaces.
