### [1] [VSF: Simple, Efficient, and Effective Negative Guidance in Few-Step Image Generation Models By Value Sign Flip](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10931)
*Wenqi Guo,Shan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VSF是一种简单高效的负向提示引导方法，通过翻转负向提示的注意力值符号来抑制不需要的内容，在少步数扩散和流匹配模型中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的负向提示引导方法如CFG、NASA和NAG在少步数生成模型中效果有限，需要一种更有效的方法来动态抑制不需要的内容。

Method: 提出Value Sign Flip (VSF)方法，通过翻转负向提示的注意力值符号来动态抑制不需要的内容，计算开销小，兼容MMDiT和交叉注意力架构。

Result: 在复杂提示对数据集上验证，VSF在静态图像和视频生成任务中均表现优异，显著提升了负向提示的遵循度，同时保持图像质量竞争力。

Conclusion: VSF是一种简单高效的负向提示引导方法，在少步数模型中优于现有方法，甚至在某些情况下超越CFG在非少步数模型中的表现。

Abstract: We introduce Value Sign Flip (VSF), a simple and efficient method for
incorporating negative prompt guidance in few-step diffusion and flow-matching
image generation models. Unlike existing approaches such as classifier-free
guidance (CFG), NASA, and NAG, VSF dynamically suppresses undesired content by
flipping the sign of attention values from negative prompts. Our method
requires only small computational overhead and integrates effectively with
MMDiT-style architectures such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 Turbo, as well as
cross-attention-based models like Wan. We validate VSF on challenging datasets
with complex prompt pairs and demonstrate superior performance in both static
image and video generation tasks. Experimental results show that VSF
significantly improves negative prompt adherence compared to prior methods in
few-step models, and even CFG in non-few-step models, while maintaining
competitive image quality. Code and ComfyUI node are available in

### [2] [Mitigating Hallucinations in Multimodal LLMs via Object-aware Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20181)
*Alberto Compagnoni,Davide Caffagni,Nicholas Moratelli,Lorenzo Baraldi,Marcella Cornia,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CHAIR-DPO方法，利用CHAIR指标构建偏好数据，通过DPO对齐训练减少MLLM的幻觉问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型存在严重的幻觉问题，生成的答案与视觉输入不符，需要有效的对齐方法来减少幻觉

Method: 利用CHAIR指标自动区分幻觉和非幻觉样本作为偏好数据，使用Direct Preference Optimization对现成MLLM进行微调

Result: 在多个幻觉基准测试上有效减少了幻觉答案的数量，证明了基于CHAIR奖励微调的有效性

Conclusion: CHAIR-DPO提供了一种简单有效的MLLM对齐方法，无需复杂流水线或专有模型，就能显著减少幻觉问题

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) emerge as a unified interface to
address a multitude of tasks, ranging from NLP to computer vision. Despite
showcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue
is the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the
user's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we
address the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer
the MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In
contrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build
synthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary
models, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to
gauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of
generated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options
(i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf
MLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we
refer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated
answers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
fine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward. Source code and trained models
are publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/CHAIR-DPO.

### [3] [SDiFL: Stable Diffusion-Driven Framework for Image Forgery Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20182)
*Yang Su,Shunquan Tan,Jiwu Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于Stable Diffusion 3的多模态框架，通过将伪造残差作为显式模态融入潜空间，实现了不依赖法学数据的高效准确图片伪造定位方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图片伪造定位方法严重依赖人工标注数据，无法跟上多模态大模型驱动的图片编辑技术发展，需要更高效的无监督方案

Method: 利用SD3多模态处理能力，将高速筛波器提取的伪造图像残差作为显式模态融入潜空间，在保留原始语义信息的同时增强伪造定位性能

Result: 在广泛使用的标准数据集上较现有最佳方法提升12%性能，对未见过的真实文档伪造和自然场景图片也表现出强劲的逆向推理能力

Conclusion: 该方法成功将SD的图像生成和知觉能力集成到图像伪造检测中，为应对新兴图片编辑技术的伪造检测提供了无监督依赖的高效解决方案

Abstract: Driven by the new generation of multi-modal large models, such as Stable
Diffusion (SD), image manipulation technologies have advanced rapidly, posing
significant challenges to image forensics. However, existing image forgery
localization methods, which heavily rely on labor-intensive and costly
annotated data, are struggling to keep pace with these emerging image
manipulation technologies. To address these challenges, we are the first to
integrate both image generation and powerful perceptual capabilities of SD into
an image forensic framework, enabling more efficient and accurate forgery
localization. First, we theoretically show that the multi-modal architecture of
SD can be conditioned on forgery-related information, enabling the model to
inherently output forgery localization results. Then, building on this
foundation, we specifically leverage the multimodal framework of Stable
DiffusionV3 (SD3) to enhance forgery localization performance.We leverage the
multi-modal processing capabilities of SD3 in the latent space by treating
image forgery residuals -- high-frequency signals extracted using specific
highpass filters -- as an explicit modality. This modality is fused into the
latent space during training to enhance forgery localization performance.
Notably, our method fully preserves the latent features extracted by SD3,
thereby retaining the rich semantic information of the input image.
Experimental results show that our framework achieves up to 12% improvements in
performance on widely used benchmarking datasets compared to current
state-of-the-art image forgery localization models. Encouragingly, the model
demonstrates strong performance on forensic tasks involving real-world document
forgery images and natural scene forging images, even when such data were
entirely unseen during training.

### [4] [Grounding Multimodal Large Language Models with Quantitative Skin Attributes: A Retrieval Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20188)
*Max Torop,Masih Eskandar,Nicholas Kurtansky,Jinyang Liu,Jochen Weber,Octavia Camps,Veronica Rotemberg,Jennifer Dy,Kivanc Kose*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文探索将多模态大语言模型与定量属性相结合，通过微调使模型能够从图像预测病变属性值，从而提高皮肤疾病诊断AI模型的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型在皮肤疾病诊断方面表现出色，但模型预测的可解释性不足限制了其实际临床应用。需要提高模型决策的透明度，让临床医生能够理解和信任AI的诊断结果。

Method: 结合多模态大语言模型和定量属性分析，通过微调使MLLM能够从皮肤病变图像中预测相关的定量属性值（如病变面积等），并在SLICE-3D数据集上通过基于内容的图像检索案例研究来评估嵌入空间的属性基础。

Result: 研究表明MLLM嵌入空间可以通过微调来基于定量属性进行基础化，这为提高模型预测的可解释性提供了有效途径。

Conclusion: 将多模态大语言模型与定量属性相结合的方法能够显著提升皮肤疾病诊断AI模型的可解释性，为临床实践应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence models have demonstrated significant success in
diagnosing skin diseases, including cancer, showing the potential to assist
clinicians in their analysis. However, the interpretability of model
predictions must be significantly improved before they can be used in practice.
To this end, we explore the combination of two promising approaches: Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) and quantitative attribute usage. MLLMs offer a
potential avenue for increased interpretability, providing reasoning for
diagnosis in natural language through an interactive format. Separately, a
number of quantitative attributes that are related to lesion appearance (e.g.,
lesion area) have recently been found predictive of malignancy with high
accuracy. Predictions grounded as a function of such concepts have the
potential for improved interpretability. We provide evidence that MLLM
embedding spaces can be grounded in such attributes, through fine-tuning to
predict their values from images. Concretely, we evaluate this grounding in the
embedding space through an attribute-specific content-based image retrieval
case study using the SLICE-3D dataset.

### [5] [Enhancing Automatic Modulation Recognition With a Reconstruction-Driven Vision Transformer Under Limited Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20193)
*Hossein Ahmadi,Banafsheh Saffari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于Vision Transformer的统一框架，整合监督、自监督和重建目标，在低标签条件下实现自动调制识别的优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动调制识别方法依赖大量标注数据或多阶段训练流程，限制了实际应用中的可扩展性和泛化能力

Method: 使用ViT编码器、轻量卷积解码器和线性分类器的统一框架，通过重建分支将增强信号映射回原始信号，在预训练中学习鲁棒特征，在微调中使用部分标签监督

Result: 在RML2018.01A数据集上，低标签条件下优于监督CNN和ViT基线，仅用15-20%标注数据即可达到ResNet水平准确率，在不同SNR水平下保持强劲性能

Conclusion: 该框架为自动调制识别提供了简单、可泛化且标签高效的解决方案

Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is critical for cognitive radio,
spectrum monitoring, and secure wireless communication. However, existing
solutions often rely on large labeled datasets or multi-stage training
pipelines, which limit scalability and generalization in practice. We propose a
unified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework that integrates supervised,
self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The model combines a ViT
encoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier; the
reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to their originals, anchoring
the encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure. This strategy promotes robust,
discriminative feature learning during pretraining, while partial label
supervision in fine-tuning enables effective classification with limited
labels. On the RML2018.01A dataset, our approach outperforms supervised CNN and
ViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only
15-20% labeled data, and maintains strong performance across varying SNR
levels. Overall, the framework provides a simple, generalizable, and
label-efficient solution for AMR.

### [6] [InfinityHuman: Towards Long-Term Audio-Driven Human](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20210)
*Xiaodi Li,Pan Xie,Yi Ren,Qijun Gan,Chen Zhang,Fangyuan Kong,Xiang Yin,Bingyue Peng,Zehuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfinityHuman是一个从粗到细的音频驱动人体动画框架，通过姿态引导的细化器和手部特定奖励机制，生成高分辨率、长时长的视频，解决了身份漂移、颜色偏移和手部运动失真等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的音频驱动人体动画方法在生成高分辨率、长时长视频时存在身份漂移、颜色偏移、场景不稳定和手部运动建模不佳等问题，需要一种能够保持外观一致性和自然手部动作的解决方案。

Method: 提出coarse-to-fine框架：首先生成音频同步表示，然后使用姿态引导的细化器逐步细化为高分辨率视频；利用解耦的姿态序列和初始帧作为视觉锚点减少漂移；引入基于高质量手部运动数据训练的手部特定奖励机制。

Result: 在EMTD和HDTF数据集上的实验表明，InfinityHuman在视频质量、身份保持、手部准确性和唇部同步方面达到了最先进的性能，消融研究证实了各模块的有效性。

Conclusion: InfinityHuman通过姿态引导的细化策略和手部奖励机制，成功解决了音频驱动人体动画中的身份漂移和手部失真问题，为生成高质量、长时长的音频同步视频提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation has attracted wide attention thanks to its
practical applications. However, critical challenges remain in generating
high-resolution, long-duration videos with consistent appearance and natural
hand motions. Existing methods extend videos using overlapping motion frames
but suffer from error accumulation, leading to identity drift, color shifts,
and scene instability. Additionally, hand movements are poorly modeled,
resulting in noticeable distortions and misalignment with the audio. In this
work, we propose InfinityHuman, a coarse-to-fine framework that first generates
audio-synchronized representations, then progressively refines them into
high-resolution, long-duration videos using a pose-guided refiner. Since pose
sequences are decoupled from appearance and resist temporal degradation, our
pose-guided refiner employs stable poses and the initial frame as a visual
anchor to reduce drift and improve lip synchronization. Moreover, to enhance
semantic accuracy and gesture realism, we introduce a hand-specific reward
mechanism trained with high-quality hand motion data. Experiments on the EMTD
and HDTF datasets show that InfinityHuman achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip-sync. Ablation
studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module. Code will be made
public.

### [7] [Spherical Vision Transformers for Audio-Visual Saliency Prediction in 360-Degree Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20221)
*Mert Cokelek,Halit Ozsoy,Nevrez Imamoglu,Cagri Ozcinar,Inci Ayhan,Erkut Erdem,Aykut Erdem*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了SalViT360和SalViT360-AV两个新颖的360度视频显著性预测模型，并创建了YT360-EyeTracking数据集，通过整合空间音频线索显著提升了全景视频中的视觉注意力预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏全面的360度视听显著性预测数据集，且现有方法未能充分考虑球面畸变和空间音频整合的复杂性，本研究旨在探索如何利用视听线索有效预测360度视频中的视觉显著性。

Method: 创建了YT360-EyeTracking数据集（包含81个ODV视频），提出了基于视觉变换器的SalViT360框架（具有球面几何感知的时空注意力层）和SalViT360-AV模型（进一步整合了基于音频输入的变换器适配器）。

Result: 在多个基准数据集（包括YT360-EyeTracking）上的实验结果表明，SalViT360和SalViT360-AV在预测360度场景中观众注意力方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 在模型架构中整合空间音频线索对于准确预测全景视频中的显著性至关重要，音频信息是提升360度视频显著性预测性能的关键因素。

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos (ODVs) are redefining viewer experiences in virtual
reality (VR) by offering an unprecedented full field-of-view (FOV). This study
extends the domain of saliency prediction to 360-degree environments,
addressing the complexities of spherical distortion and the integration of
spatial audio. Contextually, ODVs have transformed user experience by adding a
spatial audio dimension that aligns sound direction with the viewer's
perspective in spherical scenes. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive
datasets for 360-degree audio-visual saliency prediction, our study curates
YT360-EyeTracking, a new dataset of 81 ODVs, each observed under varying
audio-visual conditions. Our goal is to explore how to utilize audio-visual
cues to effectively predict visual saliency in 360-degree videos. Towards this
aim, we propose two novel saliency prediction models: SalViT360, a
vision-transformer-based framework for ODVs equipped with spherical
geometry-aware spatio-temporal attention layers, and SalViT360-AV, which
further incorporates transformer adapters conditioned on audio input. Our
results on a number of benchmark datasets, including our YT360-EyeTracking,
demonstrate that SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV significantly outperform existing
methods in predicting viewer attention in 360-degree scenes. Interpreting these
results, we suggest that integrating spatial audio cues in the model
architecture is crucial for accurate saliency prediction in omnidirectional
videos. Code and dataset will be available at
https://cyberiada.github.io/SalViT360.

### [8] [A Novel Framework for Automated Explain Vision Model Using Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20227)
*Phu-Vinh Nguyen,Tan-Hanh Pham,Chris Ngo,Truong Son Hy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Vision-Language模型的视觉模型解释方法，能够在单个样本和整个数据集层面上提供有意义的解释，帮助发现模型的失败案例和偏向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉模型开发主要关注性能指标（如准确率、IoU、mAP），而很少注意可解释性。现有xAI方法多为单样本解释，缺乏能够在整个数据集层面上解释模型一般行为的方法，而这对防止偏已判断和识别模型趋势非常重要。

Method: 提出了一种基于Vision-Language模型的流水线方法，能够同时在样本级别和数据集级别上解释视觉模型的行为。

Result: 该方法可以用最小的努力发现视觉模型的失败案例，获得模型行为的深度见解，并将视觉模型开发与xAI分析相结合。

Conclusion: 通过提出的流水线方法，本研究提供了一种有效的途径来解释视觉模型的一般行为，有助于提升图像分析的可解释性和可靠性。

Abstract: The development of many vision models mainly focuses on improving their
performance using metrics such as accuracy, IoU, and mAP, with less attention
to explainability due to the complexity of applying xAI methods to provide a
meaningful explanation of trained models. Although many existing xAI methods
aim to explain vision models sample-by-sample, methods explaining the general
behavior of vision models, which can only be captured after running on a large
dataset, are still underexplored. Furthermore, understanding the behavior of
vision models on general images can be very important to prevent biased
judgments and help identify the model's trends and patterns. With the
application of Vision-Language Models, this paper proposes a pipeline to
explain vision models at both the sample and dataset levels. The proposed
pipeline can be used to discover failure cases and gain insights into vision
models with minimal effort, thereby integrating vision model development with
xAI analysis to advance image analysis.

TL;DR: 提出ATMS-KD框架，结合自适应温度调度和混合样本增强，将MobileNetV3 Large教师模型知识蒸馏到轻量级CNN学生模型，在农业玫瑰成熟度分类任务中取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对农业资源受限环境开发轻量级CNN模型，解决传统知识蒸馏方法在农业计算机视觉应用中效果有限的问题。

Method: 使用自适应温度调度和混合样本增强的知识蒸馏框架，从MobileNetV3 Large教师模型向三种不同规模的残差CNN学生模型（Compact 1.3M、Standard 2.4M、Enhanced 3.8M参数）传递知识。

Result: 所有学生模型验证准确率超过96.7%，优于直接训练的95-96%。紧凑模型达到97.11%准确率，比次优方法提升1.60个百分点，推理延迟仅72.19ms，知识保留率超过99%。

Conclusion: ATMS-KD框架在农业计算机视觉任务中表现出色，能有效实现知识转移，适用于资源受限的农业环境，为轻量级模型开发提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This study proposes ATMS-KD (Adaptive Temperature and Mixed-Sample Knowledge
Distillation), a novel framework for developing lightweight CNN models suitable
for resource-constrained agricultural environments. The framework combines
adaptive temperature scheduling with mixed-sample augmentation to transfer
knowledge from a MobileNetV3 Large teacher model (5.7\,M parameters) to
lightweight residual CNN students. Three student configurations were evaluated:
Compact (1.3\,M parameters), Standard (2.4\,M parameters), and Enhanced (3.8\,M
parameters). The dataset used in this study consists of images of \textit{Rosa
damascena} (Damask rose) collected from agricultural fields in the Dades Oasis,
southeastern Morocco, providing a realistic benchmark for agricultural computer
vision applications under diverse environmental conditions. Experimental
evaluation on the Damascena rose maturity classification dataset demonstrated
significant improvements over direct training methods. All student models
achieved validation accuracies exceeding 96.7\% with ATMS-KD compared to
95--96\% with direct training. The framework outperformed eleven established
knowledge distillation methods, achieving 97.11\% accuracy with the compact
model -- a 1.60 percentage point improvement over the second-best approach
while maintaining the lowest inference latency of 72.19\,ms. Knowledge
retention rates exceeded 99\% for all configurations, demonstrating effective
knowledge transfer regardless of student model capacity.

### [10] [Linking heterogeneous microstructure informatics with expert characterization knowledge through customized and hybrid vision-language representations for industrial qualification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20243)
*Mutahar Safdar,Gentry Wood,Max Zimmermann,Guy Lamouche,Priti Wanjara,Yaoyao Fiona Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这项研究提出了一种新的混合视觉-语言表征框架，通过结合深度语义分割和预训练多模态模型，实现了异质微观结构的零样本分类，提升了加工制造中材料质量评估的效率和可追溯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决工业制造中高级材料质量评估的瓶颈问题，特别是对于非传统增材制造过程产生的异质结构，需要快速可靠的质量评估方法。

Method: 使用定制化的混合视觉-语言表征(VLRs)，结合深度语义分割和预训练多模态模型(CLIP和FLAVA)，将微观结构数据和专家评估编码为共享表征。通过网状相似性评分方法实现零样本分类。

Result: 在增材制造金属基复合材数据集上验证，框架能够区分合格和缺陷样品。FLAVA模型具有更高的视觉敏感性，CLIP模型在语言标准上表现更一致。Z分数标准化提升了分类效果。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了质量评估流程的可追溯性和可解释性，支持人在循环决策而无需任务特定模型重新训练，为工程信息学领域提供了可扩展的域适配质量评估策略。

Abstract: Rapid and reliable qualification of advanced materials remains a bottleneck
in industrial manufacturing, particularly for heterogeneous structures produced
via non-conventional additive manufacturing processes. This study introduces a
novel framework that links microstructure informatics with a range of expert
characterization knowledge using customized and hybrid vision-language
representations (VLRs). By integrating deep semantic segmentation with
pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), we encode both visual
microstructural data and textual expert assessments into shared
representations. To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we
develop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both
positive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their
associated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of
previously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach.
Validation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset
demonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and
defective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative
analysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the
CLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score
normalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on
their local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and
classification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method
enhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by
enabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model
retraining. By advancing semantic interoperability between raw data and expert
knowledge, this work contributes toward scalable and domain-adaptable
qualification strategies in engineering informatics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于MedNeXt-L-k5的自动化软脚空间（PVS）分割方法，在T2加权MRI数据上达到了相当于人工分割的性能，但在T1加权数据上性能较低，并未超过nnU-Net方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动分割PVS耗时且中等而可靠，现有自动化深度学习模型性能中等且稀缺跨数据集的泛化能力。

Method: 采用Transformer受启发的3D编码器-解码器卷积网络MedNeXt-L-k5，分别在同质性T2加权数据集和异质性T1加权数据集上训练模型，并通过5折交叉验证和留一地点交叉验证评估性能。

Result: 在T2加权数据上达到粗细胞级Dice分数0.88±0.06，相当于人工分割可靠性；在T1加权数据上Dice分数为0.58±0.09；跨数据集泛化性能中等，未超过nnU-Net。

Conclusion: MedNeXt-L-k5提供了一种高效的轻脚空间自动分割方案，但Transformer模型的全局上下文注意机制对于PVS分割任务并非必需。

Abstract: Enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) are increasingly recognized as biomarkers
of cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and
aging-related neurodegeneration. However, manual segmentation of PVS is
time-consuming and subject to moderate inter-rater reliability, while existing
automated deep learning models have moderate performance and typically fail to
generalize across diverse clinical and research MRI datasets. We adapted
MedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder convolutional network,
for automated PVS segmentation. Two models were trained: one using a
homogeneous dataset of 200 T2-weighted (T2w) MRI scans from the Human
Connectome Project-Aging (HCP-Aging) dataset and another using 40 heterogeneous
T1-weighted (T1w) MRI volumes from seven studies across six scanners. Model
performance was evaluated using internal 5-fold cross validation (5FCV) and
leave-one-site-out cross validation (LOSOCV). MedNeXt-L-k5 models trained on
the T2w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved voxel-level Dice scores of
0.88+/-0.06 (white matter, WM), comparable to the reported inter-rater
reliability of that dataset, and the highest yet reported in the literature.
The same models trained on the T1w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved a
substantially lower Dice score of 0.58+/-0.09 (WM). Under LOSOCV, the model had
voxel-level Dice scores of 0.38+/-0.16 (WM) and 0.35+/-0.12 (BG), and
cluster-level Dice scores of 0.61+/-0.19 (WM) and 0.62+/-0.21 (BG).
MedNeXt-L-k5 provides an efficient solution for automated PVS segmentation
across diverse T1w and T2w MRI datasets. MedNeXt-L-k5 did not outperform the
nnU-Net, indicating that the attention-based mechanisms present in
transformer-inspired models to provide global context are not required for high
accuracy in PVS segmentation.

### [12] [Plug-in Feedback Self-adaptive Attention in CLIP for Training-free Open-Vocabulary Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20265)
*Zhixiang Chi,Yanan Wu,Li Gu,Huan Liu,Ziqiang Wang,Yang Zhang,Yang Wang,Konstantinos N. Plataniotis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练、基于反馈的自适应框架，将输出层面的补丁级对应关系反向适配到中间注意力机制中，以增强CLIP在开放词汇分割中的空间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在视觉-文本对齐方面表现强劲，但在开放词汇分割中由于定位能力差而表现不佳。先前方法通过修改中间注意力来增强空间一致性，但由于后续操作（如投影）导致这种一致性无法持续传播到最终输出，且中间注意力缺乏与文本表示的直接交互。

Method: 设计了一个训练免费的反馈驱动自适应框架，包括注意力隔离、基于置信度的稀疏适配剪枝和适配集成等关键模块，将输出预测作为更强的空间一致性先验反馈到中间注意力。

Result: 该方法作为即插即用模块，无缝集成到四种最先进方法和三种骨干网络（ViT-B、ViT-L、ViT-H）中，在多种注意力类型和八个基准测试中 consistently 提升性能。

Conclusion: 通过利用模型输出作为空间一致性先验，有效增强了内部表示与最终预测之间的语义一致性，显著提升了CLIP在开放词汇分割任务中的表现。

Abstract: CLIP exhibits strong visual-textual alignment but struggle with
open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization. Prior methods enhance
spatial coherence by modifying intermediate attention. But, this coherence
isn't consistently propagated to the final output due to subsequent operations
such as projections. Additionally, intermediate attention lacks direct
interaction with text representations, such semantic discrepancy limits the
full potential of CLIP.
  In this work, we propose a training-free, feedback-driven self-adaptive
framework that adapts output-based patch-level correspondences back to the
intermediate attention. The output predictions, being the culmination of the
model's processing, encapsulate the most comprehensive visual and textual
semantics about each patch. Our approach enhances semantic consistency between
internal representations and final predictions by leveraging the model's
outputs as a stronger spatial coherence prior. We design key modules, including
attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and
adaptation ensemble, to effectively feedback the output coherence cues. Our
method functions as a plug-in module, seamlessly integrating into four
state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H). We
further validate our framework across multiple attention types (Q-K, self-self,
and Proxy augmented with MAE, SAM, and DINO). Our approach consistently
improves their performance across eight benchmarks.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务上表现优异，但其内部处理机制仍未被充分探索，需要系统分析模型如何跨层次处理多模态输入

Method: 训练线性分类器从各层token嵌入中预测细粒度视觉类别，使用标准化锚点问题，并在三种提示变体下评估：词汇变体、语义否定变体和输出格式变体

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5、LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3和Qwen2-VL中发现一致的分阶段结构：早期层执行视觉基础，中间层支持词汇整合和语义推理，最终层准备任务特定输出

Conclusion: 该框架为MLLM的层次组织提供了统一视角，并提供了轻量级、模型无关的方法来分析多模态表示动态，整体阶段结构在不同变体中保持稳定但具体层次分配随基础LLM架构变化

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet their internal processing
dynamics remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce a probing framework
to systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across
layers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories
(e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a
standardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different
layers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt
variations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level
changes, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by
modifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that
preserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent
stage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle
layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers
prepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall
stage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization,
instruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation
to each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture. Our
findings provide a unified perspective on the layer-wise organization of MLLMs
and offer a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal
representation dynamics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出SLiCS方法，通过监督字典学习将视觉-语言联合嵌入空间解耦为概念特定的子空间，实现更精确的概念过滤图像检索和条件生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言联合嵌入空间（如CLIP）包含丰富的语义信息，但缺乏对复杂场景内容的解耦能力。作者假设可以通过将嵌入分解为多个概念特定的分量向量来实现空间解耦。

Method: 采用监督字典学习方法，估计线性合成模型，通过稀疏、非负的字典原子组合来匹配多标签信息。使用新颖的交替优化算法保证收敛，并利用文本嵌入进行语义描述和零样本分类。

Result: SLiCS方法在TiTok压缩自编码器嵌入和DINOv2自监督嵌入上都实现了更精确的概念过滤图像检索，定量和定性结果均显示性能提升。

Conclusion: 稀疏线性概念子空间（SLiCS）能够有效解耦嵌入空间，为概念过滤的图像检索和条件生成提供更精确的结果，适用于多种嵌入表示。

Abstract: Vision-language co-embedding networks, such as CLIP, provide a latent
embedding space with semantic information that is useful for downstream tasks.
We hypothesize that the embedding space can be disentangled to separate the
information on the content of complex scenes by decomposing the embedding into
multiple concept-specific component vectors that lie in different subspaces. We
propose a supervised dictionary learning approach to estimate a linear
synthesis model consisting of sparse, non-negative combinations of groups of
vectors in the dictionary (atoms), whose group-wise activity matches the
multi-label information. Each concept-specific component is a non-negative
combination of atoms associated to a label. The group-structured dictionary is
optimized through a novel alternating optimization with guaranteed convergence.
Exploiting the text co-embeddings, we detail how semantically meaningful
descriptions can be found based on text embeddings of words best approximated
by a concept's group of atoms, and unsupervised dictionary learning can exploit
zero-shot classification of training set images using the text embeddings of
concept labels to provide instance-wise multi-labels. We show that the
disentangled embeddings provided by our sparse linear concept subspaces (SLiCS)
enable concept-filtered image retrieval (and conditional generation using
image-to-prompt) that is more precise. We also apply SLiCS to highly-compressed
autoencoder embeddings from TiTok and the latent embedding from self-supervised
DINOv2. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight the improved precision
of the concept-filtered image retrieval for all embeddings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗视觉语言模型在临床应用中存在严重的PHI泄露、数据泄漏和网络安全风险，需要安全可靠的部署解决方案。

Method: 开发图形用户界面工具包，支持手动选择模型、插件式部署Hugging Face开源模型，通过Docker编排实现操作系统无关的隐私保护推理。

Result: 使用单个NVIDIA A6000 GPU的离线工作站成功部署5个先进VLM模型，病理学家评估了1015个临床-模型评分事件，发现模型存在回答偏离、推理模糊和病理术语不一致等限制。

Conclusion: MedFoundationHub提供了一个安全、易用的医疗VLM部署解决方案，但当前模型仍存在显著局限性，需要进一步改进以提升临床实用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in medical vision-language models (VLMs) open up remarkable
opportunities for clinical applications such as automated report generation,
copilots for physicians, and uncertainty quantification. However, despite their
promise, medical VLMs introduce serious security concerns, most notably risks
of Protected Health Information (PHI) exposure, data leakage, and vulnerability
to cyberthreats - which are especially critical in hospital environments. Even
when adopted for research or non-clinical purposes, healthcare organizations
must exercise caution and implement safeguards. To address these challenges, we
present MedFoundationHub, a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit that: (1)
enables physicians to manually select and use different models without
programming expertise, (2) supports engineers in efficiently deploying medical
VLMs in a plug-and-play fashion, with seamless integration of Hugging Face
open-source models, and (3) ensures privacy-preserving inference through
Docker-orchestrated, operating system agnostic deployment. MedFoundationHub
requires only an offline local workstation equipped with a single NVIDIA A6000
GPU, making it both secure and accessible within the typical resources of
academic research labs. To evaluate current capabilities, we engaged
board-certified pathologists to deploy and assess five state-of-the-art VLMs
(Google-MedGemma3-4B, Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, and
LLaVA-1.5-7B/13B). Expert evaluation covered colon cases and renal cases,
yielding 1015 clinician-model scoring events. These assessments revealed
recurring limitations, including off-target answers, vague reasoning, and
inconsistent pathology terminology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务密集预测中充分的跨任务交互对成功至关重要，但现有方法面临交互完整性与计算效率之间的权衡限制

Method: 引入双向交互扫描（BI-Scan）机制构建任务特定的双向序列表示，结合任务优先和位置优先扫描模式；采用多尺度扫描（MS-Scan）机制实现多粒度场景建模

Result: 在NYUD-V2和PASCAL-Context两个基准测试上表现出优于最先进竞争方法的性能

Conclusion: BIM模型通过创新的扫描机制有效解决了多任务密集预测中的交互效率问题，在保持线性复杂度的同时实现了充分的跨任务信息交互

Abstract: Sufficient cross-task interaction is crucial for success in multi-task dense
prediction. However, sufficient interaction often results in high computational
complexity, forcing existing methods to face the trade-off between interaction
completeness and computational efficiency. To address this limitation, this
work proposes a Bidirectional Interaction Mamba (BIM), which incorporates novel
scanning mechanisms to adapt the Mamba modeling approach for multi-task dense
prediction. On the one hand, we introduce a novel Bidirectional Interaction
Scan (BI-Scan) mechanism, which constructs task-specific representations as
bidirectional sequences during interaction. By integrating task-first and
position-first scanning modes within a unified linear complexity architecture,
BI-Scan efficiently preserves critical cross-task information. On the other
hand, we employ a Multi-Scale Scan~(MS-Scan) mechanism to achieve
multi-granularity scene modeling. This design not only meets the diverse
granularity requirements of various tasks but also enhances nuanced cross-task
feature interactions. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks,
\emph{i.e.}, NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context, show the superiority of our BIM vs its
state-of-the-art competitors.

Motivation: 现有的可视化编辑方法主要依靠文本指导，在复杂场景下无法充分描述，需要非文本编辑提示来补充信息

Method: 利用预训练的多模态编码器，通过消除音频编码器空间与变分模型提示编码器空间的差异，采用分离噪声分支和适配性补丁选择来处理多模态编辑提示

Result: 在多样化编辑任务上进行了全面实验，证明该框架能够通过融合音频丰富信息来处理复杂编辑场景，而仅依靠文本的方法无法完成

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新的音频导向可视化编辑框架，能够在不需额外训练的情况下有效处理复杂的多模态编辑任务，为多模态编辑领域提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Visual editing with diffusion models has made significant progress but often
struggles with complex scenarios that textual guidance alone could not
adequately describe, highlighting the need for additional non-text editing
prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel audio-guided visual editing
framework that can handle complex editing tasks with multiple text and audio
prompts without requiring additional training. Existing audio-guided visual
editing methods often necessitate training on specific datasets to align audio
with text, limiting their generalization to real-world situations. We leverage
a pre-trained multi-modal encoder with strong zero-shot capabilities and
integrate diverse audio into visual editing tasks, by alleviating the
discrepancy between the audio encoder space and the diffusion model's prompt
encoder space. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to handle complex
scenarios with multiple and multi-modal editing prompts through our separate
noise branching and adaptive patch selection. Our comprehensive experiments on
diverse editing tasks demonstrate that our framework excels in handling
complicated editing scenarios by incorporating rich information from audio,
where text-only approaches fail.

Conclusion: AEVLP框架通过创新的损失函数和伪标签技术，有效解决了单正多标签学习中的噪声和准确性问题，为多标签分类任务提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Multi-label learning is a challenging computer vision task that requires
assigning multiple categories to each image. However, fully annotating
large-scale datasets is often impractical due to high costs and effort,
motivating the study of learning from partially annotated data. In the extreme
case of Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPML), each image is provided
with only one positive label, while all other labels remain unannotated.
Traditional SPML methods that treat missing labels as unknown or negative tend
to yield inaccuracies and false negatives, and integrating various
pseudo-labeling strategies can introduce additional noise. To address these
challenges, we propose the Generalized Pseudo-Label Robust Loss (GPR Loss), a
novel loss function that effectively learns from diverse pseudo-labels while
mitigating noise. Complementing this, we introduce a simple yet effective
Dynamic Augmented Multi-focus Pseudo-labeling (DAMP) technique. Together, these
contributions form the Adaptive and Efficient Vision-Language Pseudo-Labeling
(AEVLP) framework. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our framework significantly advances multi-label classification, achieving
state-of-the-art results.

Motivation: 当前ANN-SNN转换方法在分类任务中表现优异，但在视觉棆测任务中性能仍不理想，需要解决异质性刺激模式导致的残余膜电位问题

Method: 提出延迟刺激方法来减少异质性刺激模式的影响，设计时间依赖积分发点神经元（tdIF），使IF神经元能够根据时间序列动态调整积累和发点行为

Conclusion: 该方法能够使刺激呈现出明显的时间特性，而不仅依赖频率表征，在保持低能耗的同时实现了更精确的特征表征，为高性能超低延迟视觉检测提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the brain, are characterized by
minimal power consumption and swift inference capabilities on neuromorphic
hardware, and have been widely applied to various visual perception tasks.
Current ANN-SNN conversion methods have achieved excellent results in
classification tasks with ultra-low time-steps, but their performance in visual
detection tasks remains suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a delay-spike
approach to mitigate the issue of residual membrane potential caused by
heterogeneous spiking patterns. Furthermore, we propose a novel
temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture for SNNs. This
enables Integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons to dynamically adjust their
accumulation and firing behaviors based on the temporal order of time-steps.
Our method enables spikes to exhibit distinct temporal properties, rather than
relying solely on frequency-based representations. Moreover, the tdIF neuron
maintains energy consumption on par with traditional IF neuron. We demonstrate
that our method achieves more precise feature representation with lower
time-steps, enabling high performance and ultra-low latency in visual detection
tasks. In this study, we conduct extensive evaluation of the tdIF method across
two critical vision tasks: object detection and lane line detection. The
results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses current ANN-SNN
conversion approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with ultra-low
latency (within 5 time-steps).

Motivation: 现有显著目标检测方法在复杂场景中容易丢失细节、边缘模糊，且单模态信息融合不足，需要提升检测精度和鲁棒性

Method: 设计动态不确定性图卷积模块(DUGC)传播层间不确定性，提出多模态协同融合策略(MCF)加权融合RGB、深度和边缘特征，采用多尺度损失和一致性约束优化检测性能

Conclusion: DUP-MCRNet通过不确定性传播和多模态协同融合有效提升了显著目标检测的精度和鲁棒性，特别适用于复杂场景

Abstract: In view of the problems that existing salient object detection (SOD) methods
are prone to losing details, blurring edges, and insufficient fusion of
single-modal information in complex scenes, this paper proposes a dynamic
uncertainty propagation and multimodal collaborative reasoning network
(DUP-MCRNet). Firstly, a dynamic uncertainty graph convolution module (DUGC) is
designed to propagate uncertainty between layers through a sparse graph
constructed based on spatial semantic distance, and combined with channel
adaptive interaction, it effectively improves the detection accuracy of small
structures and edge regions. Secondly, a multimodal collaborative fusion
strategy (MCF) is proposed, which uses learnable modality gating weights to
weightedly fuse the attention maps of RGB, depth, and edge features. It can
dynamically adjust the importance of each modality according to different
scenes, effectively suppress redundant or interfering information, and
strengthen the semantic complementarity and consistency between
cross-modalities, thereby improving the ability to identify salient regions
under occlusion, weak texture or background interference. Finally, the
detection performance at the pixel level and region level is optimized through
multi-scale BCE and IoU loss, cross-scale consistency constraints, and
uncertainty-guided supervision mechanisms. Extensive experiments show that
DUP-MCRNet outperforms various SOD methods on most common benchmark datasets,
especially in terms of edge clarity and robustness to complex backgrounds. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/YukiBear426/DUP-MCRNet.

Conclusion: 多尺度图像特征通过多尺度BEV特征的利用能够有效提升多视角行人检测性能，特别是在处理尺度变化大的场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Detection (MVPD) aims to detect pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view (BEV) from multi-view images. In MVPD, end-to-end
trainable deep learning methods have progressed greatly. However, they often
struggle to detect pedestrians with consistently small or large scales in views
or with vastly different scales between views. This is because they do not
exploit multi-scale image features to generate the BEV feature and detect
pedestrians. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel MVPD method, called
Multi-Scale Multi-View Detection (MSMVD). MSMVD generates multi-scale BEV
features by projecting multi-scale image features extracted from individual
views into the BEV space, scale-by-scale. Each of these BEV features inherits
the properties of its corresponding scale image features from multiple views.
Therefore, these BEV features help the precise detection of pedestrians with
consistently small or large scales in views. Then, MSMVD combines information
at different scales of multiple views by processing the multi-scale BEV
features using a feature pyramid network. This improves the detection of
pedestrians with vastly different scales between views. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that exploiting multi-scale image features via multi-scale BEV
features greatly improves the detection performance, and MSMVD outperforms the
previous highest MODA by $4.5$ points on the GMVD dataset.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of real-time deepfake generation techniques,
forged content is becoming increasingly realistic and widespread across
applications like video conferencing and social media. Although
state-of-the-art detectors achieve high accuracy on standard benchmarks, their
heavy computational cost hinders real-time deployment in practical
applications. To address this, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Aware
Multi-Scale Fusion Network (SFMFNet), a lightweight yet effective architecture
for real-time deepfake detection. We design a spatial-frequency hybrid aware
module that jointly leverages spatial textures and frequency artifacts through
a gated mechanism, enhancing sensitivity to subtle manipulations. A
token-selective cross attention mechanism enables efficient multi-level feature
interaction, while a residual-enhanced blur pooling structure helps retain key
semantic cues during downsampling. Experiments on several benchmark datasets
show that SFMFNet achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency,
with strong generalization and practical value for real-time applications.

Abstract: We propose a novel medical image classification method that integrates
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation (SKD). In
real-world medical settings, deploying large-scale models is often limited by
computational resource constraints, which pose significant challenges for their
practical implementation. Thus, developing lightweight models that achieve
comparable performance to large-scale models while maintaining computational
efficiency is crucial. To address this, we employ a dual-model weight selection
strategy that initializes two lightweight models with weights derived from a
large pretrained model, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Next, SKD is
applied to these selected models, allowing the use of a broad range of initial
weight configurations without imposing additional excessive computational cost,
followed by fine-tuning for the target classification tasks. By combining
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches, which often fail to
retain critical information in compact models. Extensive experiments on
publicly available datasets-chest X-ray images, lung computed tomography scans,
and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans-demonstrate the superior performance
and robustness of our approach compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: 通过整合两个轻量模块，方法生成了紧凑的特征表示，提供了高效的上下文建模和加速的编码过程。

Abstract: LiDAR point clouds are fundamental to various applications, yet
high-precision scans incur substantial storage and transmission overhead.
Existing methods typically convert unordered points into hierarchical octree or
voxel structures for dense-to-sparse predictive coding. However, the extreme
sparsity of geometric details hinders efficient context modeling, thereby
limiting their compression performance and speed. To address this challenge, we
propose to generate compact features for efficient predictive coding. Our
framework comprises two lightweight modules. First, the Geometry
Re-Densification Module re-densifies encoded sparse geometry, extracts features
at denser scale, and then re-sparsifies the features for predictive coding.
This module avoids costly computation on highly sparse details while
maintaining a lightweight prediction head. Second, the Cross-scale Feature
Propagation Module leverages occupancy cues from multiple resolution levels to
guide hierarchical feature propagation. This design facilitates information
sharing across scales, thereby reducing redundant feature extraction and
providing enriched features for the Geometry Re-Densification Module. By
integrating these two modules, our method yields a compact feature
representation that provides efficient context modeling and accelerates the
coding process. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art
compression ratios and real-time performance, achieving 26 FPS for both
encoding and decoding at 12-bit quantization. Code is available at

Conclusion: 视频中的常识先验知识显著促进了3D创作，为3D生成提供了新的解决方案，所有资源均已开源。

Abstract: Scaling laws have validated the success and promise of large-data-trained
models in creative generation across text, image, and video domains. However,
this paradigm faces data scarcity in the 3D domain, as there is far less of it
available on the internet compared to the aforementioned modalities.
Fortunately, there exist adequate videos that inherently contain commonsense
priors, offering an alternative supervisory signal to mitigate the
generalization bottleneck caused by limited native 3D data. On the one hand,
videos capturing multiple views of an object or scene provide a spatial
consistency prior for 3D generation. On the other hand, the rich semantic
information contained within the videos enables the generated content to be
more faithful to the text prompts and semantically plausible. This paper
explores how to apply the video modality in 3D asset generation, spanning
datasets to models. We introduce Droplet3D-4M, the first large-scale video
dataset with multi-view level annotations, and train Droplet3D, a generative
model supporting both image and dense text input. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to
produce spatially consistent and semantically plausible content. Moreover, in
contrast to the prevailing 3D solutions, our approach exhibits the potential
for extension to scene-level applications. This indicates that the commonsense
priors from the videos significantly facilitate 3D creation. We have
open-sourced all resources including the dataset, code, technical framework,
and model weights: https://dropletx.github.io/.

TL;DR: G^2Editor是一个用于驾驶视频中逼真精确物体编辑的框架，通过3D高斯表示和层次化特征控制，在Waymo数据集上实现了优于现有方法的姿态控制性和视觉质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统的训练和验证需要大量corner cases，但真实世界采集成本高且危险。现有基于3D高斯溅射或图像生成模型的方法存在视觉保真度有限和姿态控制不精确的问题

Method: 使用编辑对象的3D高斯表示作为密集先验注入去噪过程，采用场景级3D边界框布局重建非目标对象的遮挡区域，并融入层次化细粒度特征指导编辑对象的外观细节

Result: 在Waymo Open Dataset上的实验表明，G^2Editor在统一框架内有效支持物体重定位、插入和删除操作，在姿态控制性和视觉质量方面优于现有方法

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶系统提供了高质量的场景编辑工具，能够生成多样化的corner cases，同时有利于下游数据驱动任务

Abstract: Corner cases are crucial for training and validating autonomous driving
systems, yet collecting them from the real world is often costly and hazardous.
Editing objects within captured sensor data offers an effective alternative for
generating diverse scenarios, commonly achieved through 3D Gaussian Splatting
or image generative models. However, these approaches often suffer from limited
visual fidelity or imprecise pose control. To address these issues, we propose
G^2Editor, a framework designed for photorealistic and precise object editing
in driving videos. Our method leverages a 3D Gaussian representation of the
edited object as a dense prior, injected into the denoising process to ensure
accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box
layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects.
Furthermore, to guide the appearance details of the edited object, we
incorporate hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during
generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that G^2Editor
effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a
unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability
and visual quality, while also benefiting downstream data-driven tasks.

TL;DR: 通过病理知识领域随机化策略，从健康数据生成合成数据来解决胎儿脑分割中CCD病例数据稀缺问题，实现了更准确的分割和生物标记物提取


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胎儿脑分割对评估神经发育至关重要，但胰体胶体发育不良(CCD)等稀有病变导致注释数据极其稀缺，限制了深度学习模型的普遍性

Method: 提出病理知识领域随机化策略，将CCD表现的先验知识嵌入合成数据生成流程，仅依靠健康数据模拟多样化的脑部改变

Result: 在248例健康胎儿、26例CCD病例和47例其他脑部病变的群体中，在CCD案例上取得显著改善，同时保持对健康和其他病变的性能。LCC估计错误从10.9mm降至0.7mm

Conclusion: 将领域特定的解剖先验知识整合到合成数据流程中，可有效缓解数据稀缺问题，提高对稀有但临床重要病变的分析能力

Abstract: Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and
assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum
dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the
rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of
deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain
randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a
synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations
from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without
requiring pathological annotations.
  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with
CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on
CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with
other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically
relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show
their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed
augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in
healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these
quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological
consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable
shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating
domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively
mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant
malformations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音识别系统对聋哑人士不可用，而现有的视觉替代方案（手语和唇读）通常被孤立研究，缺乏统一的整合框架来探索多模态协同效应。

Method: 设计了一个统一的模态无关架构，能够有效处理异构输入，特别探索了唇部运动作为非手动线索在手语理解中的作用。

Result: 在SLT、VSR、ASR和AVSR等多个任务上达到或优于专门化最先进模型，分析表明将唇部运动作为独立模态显式建模能显著提升手语翻译性能。

Conclusion: 该统一框架成功整合了多种通信模态，证明了多模态协同的重要性，特别是唇部运动在手语理解中的关键作用，为无障碍通信技术提供了新方向。

Abstract: Audio is the primary modality for human communication and has driven the
success of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies. However, such
systems remain inherently inaccessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of
hearing. Visual alternatives such as sign language and lip reading offer
effective substitutes, and recent advances in Sign Language Translation (SLT)
and Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) have improved audio-less communication.
Yet, these modalities have largely been studied in isolation, and their
integration within a unified framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we
introduce the first unified framework capable of handling diverse combinations
of sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation.
We focus on three main objectives: (i) designing a unified, modality-agnostic
architecture capable of effectively processing heterogeneous inputs; (ii)
exploring the underexamined synergy among modalities, particularly the role of
lip movements as non-manual cues in sign language comprehension; and (iii)
achieving performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art models
specialized for individual tasks. Building on this framework, we achieve
performance on par with or better than task-specific state-of-the-art models
across SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that
explicitly modeling lip movements as a separate modality significantly improves
SLT performance.

TL;DR: Video-MTR是一个强化多轮推理框架，通过迭代选择关键视频片段和问题理解，实现端到端的长视频理解，无需外部视觉语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解存在长时序依赖和多事件的挑战，现有方法依赖静态推理或外部视觉语言模型，存在复杂性和端到端训练不足导致的性能不佳问题。

Method: 提出多轮推理框架，逐步选择视频片段并基于先前处理片段的理解进行迭代推理；引入门控双层次奖励系统，结合轨迹级和轮级奖励来优化视频片段选择和问题理解。

Result: 在VideoMME、MLVU和EgoSchema等基准测试中，Video-MTR在准确性和效率方面均优于现有方法，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Video-MTR通过迭代推理和端到端训练，有效解决了长视频理解的挑战，提升了性能并减少了对外部模型的依赖。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding, characterized by long-range temporal
dependencies and multiple events, remains a challenge. Existing methods often
rely on static reasoning or external visual-language models (VLMs), which face
issues like complexity and sub-optimal performance due to the lack of
end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose Video-MTR, a reinforced
multi-turn reasoning framework designed to enable iterative key video segment
selection and question comprehension. Unlike traditional video reasoning
pipeline, which generate predictions in a single turn, Video-MTR performs
reasoning in multiple turns, selecting video segments progressively based on
the evolving understanding of previously processed segments and the current
question. This iterative process allows for a more refined and contextually
aware analysis of the video. To ensure intermediate reasoning process, we
introduce a novel gated bi-level reward system, combining trajectory-level
rewards based on answer correctness and turn-level rewards emphasizing
frame-query relevance. This system optimizes both video segment selection and
question comprehension, eliminating the need for external VLMs and allowing
end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU,
and EgoSchema demonstrate that Video-MTR outperforms existing methods in both
accuracy and efficiency, advancing the state-of-the-art in long video
understanding.

TL;DR: DUO是首个针对单目3D目标检测的测试时自适应框架，通过联合优化语义和几何双重不确定性来提升域迁移下的检测鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTA方法虽然认识到低不确定性与高泛化能力的正相关，但未能解决M3OD中固有的双重不确定性（语义不确定性和几何不确定性），导致在真实世界域迁移下可靠性下降。

Method: 提出了双重不确定性优化(DUO)框架：1）通过凸优化视角创新性地推导出无监督版本的focal loss，实现标签无关的不确定性加权；2）设计语义感知的法向场约束，在语义清晰区域保持几何一致性；3）构建双分支互补机制，空间感知改善语义分类，语义预测优化空间理解。

Result: 在多个数据集和域迁移类型上的广泛实验表明，DUO优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DUO通过联合最小化语义和几何双重不确定性，显著提升了单目3D目标检测在域迁移下的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) is pivotal for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, yet its reliability deteriorates
significantly under real-world domain shifts caused by environmental or sensor
variations. To address these shifts, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have
emerged, enabling models to adapt to target distributions during inference.
While prior TTA approaches recognize the positive correlation between low
uncertainty and high generalization ability, they fail to address the dual
uncertainty inherent to M3OD: semantic uncertainty (ambiguous class
predictions) and geometric uncertainty (unstable spatial localization). To
bridge this gap, we propose Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO), the first TTA
framework designed to jointly minimize both uncertainties for robust M3OD.
Through a convex optimization lens, we introduce an innovative convex structure
of the focal loss and further derive a novel unsupervised version, enabling
label-agnostic uncertainty weighting and balanced learning for high-uncertainty
objects. In parallel, we design a semantic-aware normal field constraint that
preserves geometric coherence in regions with clear semantic cues, reducing
uncertainty from the unstable 3D representation. This dual-branch mechanism
forms a complementary loop: enhanced spatial perception improves semantic
classification, and robust semantic predictions further refine spatial
understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DUO over
existing methods across various datasets and domain shift types.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to more studies to enhance golfers'
shot precision. However, these existing studies have not quantitatively
established the relationship between swing posture and ball trajectory,
limiting their ability to provide golfers with the necessary insights for swing
improvement. In this paper, we propose a new dataset called CaddieSet, which
includes joint information and various ball information from a single shot.
CaddieSet extracts joint information from a single swing video by segmenting it
into eight swing phases using a computer vision-based approach. Furthermore,
based on expert golf domain knowledge, we define 15 key metrics that influence
a golf swing, enabling the interpretation of swing outcomes through
swing-related features. Through experiments, we demonstrated the feasibility of
CaddieSet for predicting ball trajectories using various benchmarks. In
particular, we focus on interpretable models among several benchmarks and
verify that swing feedback using our joint features is quantitatively
consistent with established domain knowledge. This work is expected to offer
new insight into golf swing analysis for both academia and the sports industry.

Result: 在MVTec 3D-AD数据集上实现了新的最先进性能，显著降低了误报率

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了多模态融合中的性能退化问题，具有工业部署的实用价值

Abstract: Surface anomaly detection is pivotal for ensuring product quality in
industrial manufacturing. While 2D image-based methods have achieved remarkable
success, 3D point cloud-based detection remains underexplored despite its
richer geometric cues. We argue that the key bottleneck is the absence of
powerful pretrained foundation backbones in 3D comparable to those in 2D. To
bridge this gap, we propose Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet), an
ensemble framework that synergizes 2D pretrained expert with 3D expert models.
However, naively fusing predictions from disparate sources is non-trivial:
existing strategies can be affected by a poorly performing modality and thus
degrade overall accuracy. To address this challenge, We introduce an novel
Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module that dynamically assesses the contribution
of each source and reweights their anomaly scores. Furthermore, we devise
critical loss functions that explicitly guide the optimization of IAF, enabling
it to combine the collective knowledge of the source experts but also preserve
their unique strengths, thereby enhancing the overall performance of anomaly
detection. Extensive experiments on MVTec 3D-AD demonstrate that our IAENet
achieves a new state-of-the-art with a markedly lower false positive rate,
underscoring its practical value for industrial deployment.

Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成中语义图像编辑的挑战，现有方法存在重建误差和数据集质量限制的问题。

Method: 提出Cross-Attentive UNet架构，通过注意力桥接机制将参考图像特征注入到提示到编辑图像的生成过程中，无需架构修改或反转。

Result: 在Emu Edit基准测试中显示编辑准确性和一致性得到提升，能够无缝集成ControlNet、IP-Adapter等扩展。

Conclusion: DescriptiveEdit框架通过重新定义编辑范式，克服了指令数据集质量限制，具有更好的可扩展性和生成能力。

Abstract: Despite the progress in text-to-image generation, semantic image editing
remains a challenge. Inversion-based algorithms unavoidably introduce
reconstruction errors, while instruction-based models mainly suffer from
limited dataset quality and scale. To address these problems, we propose a
descriptive-prompt-based editing framework, named DescriptiveEdit. The core
idea is to re-frame `instruction-based image editing' as `reference-image-based
text-to-image generation', which preserves the generative power of well-trained
Text-to-Image models without architectural modifications or inversion.
Specifically, taking the reference image and a prompt as input, we introduce a
Cross-Attentive UNet, which newly adds attention bridges to inject reference
image features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process. Owing to its
text-to-image nature, DescriptiveEdit overcomes limitations in instruction
dataset quality, integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other
extensions, and is more scalable. Experiments on the Emu Edit benchmark show it
improves editing accuracy and consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的持续测试时适应方法依赖模型预测生成伪标签，但伪标签质量无法保证且存在错误累积问题。仅依赖目标域特征会导致混淆和学习偏差。

Method: 使用双分类器将目标数据的完整特征表示解耦为语义相关特征和域相关特征，保持子特征与完整特征的一致性。设置自适应阈值计算样本置信度，进行损失加权的自监督学习。

Result: 在CIFAR10-C、CIFAR100-C和ImageNet-C等多个数据集上的广泛实验验证了该方法的有效性，在持续测试时适应场景中表现出稳定的性能。

Conclusion: DCFS框架通过双路径特征一致性和置信度感知学习，能够从多角度全面捕捉数据特征，有效减少伪标签噪声并缓解错误累积问题。

Abstract: Continual test-time adaptation aims to continuously adapt a pre-trained model
to a stream of target domain data without accessing source data. Without access
to source domain data, the model focuses solely on the feature characteristics
of the target data. Relying exclusively on these features can lead to confusion
and introduce learning biases. Currently, many existing methods generate
pseudo-labels via model predictions. However, the quality of pseudo-labels
cannot be guaranteed and the problem of error accumulation must be solved. To
address these challenges, we propose DCFS, a novel CTTA framework that
introduces dual-path feature consistency and confidence-aware sample learning.
This framework disentangles the whole feature representation of the target data
into semantic-related feature and domain-related feature using dual classifiers
to learn distinct feature representations. By maintaining consistency between
the sub-features and the whole feature, the model can comprehensively capture
data features from multiple perspectives. Additionally, to ensure that the
whole feature information of the target domain samples is not overlooked, we
set a adaptive threshold and calculate a confidence score for each sample to
carry out loss weighted self-supervised learning, effectively reducing the
noise of pseudo-labels and alleviating the problem of error accumulation. The
efficacy of our proposed method is validated through extensive experimentation
across various datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C,
demonstrating consistent performance in continual test-time adaptation
scenarios.

Motivation: 相机标定质量对新视角合成至关重要，1像素错误就会对重建质量产生显著影响，而真实场景缺乏真实标定地基

Method: 通过3DGS模型进行相机参数细调，利用新视角颜色损失的回传优化标定参数

Result: 在3DGS参考数据集上平均提升0.4 dB PSNR，显著提升了新视角合成质量

Conclusion: 虽然细调过程可能耗时，但对于重要场景的标定，新视角质量的提升价值远超过训练时间成本

Abstract: The quality of the camera calibration is of major importance for evaluating
progresses in novel view synthesis, as a 1-pixel error on the calibration has a
significant impact on the reconstruction quality. While there is no ground
truth for real scenes, the quality of the calibration is assessed by the
quality of the novel view synthesis. This paper proposes to use a 3DGS model to
fine tune calibration by backpropagation of novel view color loss with respect
to the cameras parameters. The new calibration alone brings an average
improvement of 0.4 dB PSNR on the dataset used as reference by 3DGS. The fine
tuning may be long and its suitability depends on the criticity of training
time, but for calibration of reference scenes, such as Mip-NeRF 360, the stake
of novel view quality is the most important.

Conclusion: 该框架通过动态多模态样本选择有效减少了标注成本，为医学图像分割提供了一种高效的主动学习解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate gross tumor volume segmentation on multi-modal medical data is
critical for radiotherapy planning in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and
glioblastoma. Recent advances in deep neural networks have brought promising
results in medical image segmentation, leading to an increasing demand for
labeled data. Since labeling medical images is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, active learning has emerged as a solution to reduce annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples to label and adapting
high-performance models with as few labeled samples as possible. Previous
active domain adaptation (ADA) methods seek to minimize sample redundancy by
selecting samples that are farthest from the source domain. However, such
one-off selection can easily cause negative transfer, and access to source
medical data is often limited. Moreover, the query strategy for multi-modal
medical data remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an active and
sequential domain adaptation framework for dynamic multi-modal sample selection
in ADA. We derive a query strategy to prioritize labeling and training on the
most valuable samples based on their informativeness and representativeness.
Empirical validation on diverse gross tumor volume segmentation tasks
demonstrates that our method achieves favorable segmentation performance,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art ADA methods. Code is available at

Conclusion: 数据级融合策略能够有效利用LiDAR和RGB图像的互补信息，通过双向融合和噪声抑制方法，显著提升了无监督3D目标检测的性能

Abstract: Existing LiDAR-based 3D object detectors typically rely on manually annotated
labels for training to achieve good performance. However, obtaining
high-quality 3D labels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this
issue, recent works explore unsupervised 3D object detection by introducing RGB
images as an auxiliary modal to assist pseudo-box generation. However, these
methods simply integrate pseudo-boxes generated by LiDAR point clouds and RGB
images. Yet, such a label-level fusion strategy brings limited improvements to
the quality of pseudo-boxes, as it overlooks the complementary nature in terms
of LiDAR and RGB image data. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a
novel data-level fusion framework that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data at
an early stage. Specifically, we utilize vision foundation models for instance
segmentation and depth estimation on images and introduce a bi-directional
fusion method, where real points acquire category labels from the 2D space,
while 2D pixels are projected onto 3D to enhance real point density. To
mitigate noise from depth and segmentation estimations, we propose a local and
global filtering method, which applies local radius filtering to suppress depth
estimation errors and global statistical filtering to remove
segmentation-induced outliers. Furthermore, we propose a data-level fusion
based dynamic self-evolution strategy, which iteratively refines pseudo-boxes
under a dense representation, significantly improving localization accuracy.
Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the detector
trained by our method significantly outperforms that trained by previous
state-of-the-art methods with 28.4$\%$ mAP on the nuScenes validation
benchmark.

Abstract: Estimating Body Mass Index (BMI) from camera images with machine learning
models enables rapid weight assessment when traditional methods are unavailable
or impractical, such as in telehealth or emergency scenarios. Existing computer
vision approaches have been limited to datasets of up to 14,500 images. In this
study, we present a deep learning-based BMI estimation method trained on our
WayBED dataset, a large proprietary collection of 84,963 smartphone images from
25,353 individuals. We introduce an automatic filtering method that uses
posture clustering and person detection to curate the dataset by removing
low-quality images, such as those with atypical postures or incomplete views.
This process retained 71,322 high-quality images suitable for training. We
achieve a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.9% on our hold-out test
set (WayBED data) using full-body images, the lowest value in the published
literature to the best of our knowledge. Further, we achieve a MAPE of 13% on
the completely unseen~(during training) VisualBodyToBMI dataset, comparable
with state-of-the-art approaches trained on it, demonstrating robust
generalization. Lastly, we fine-tune our model on VisualBodyToBMI and achieve a
MAPE of 8.56%, the lowest reported value on this dataset so far. We deploy the
full pipeline, including image filtering and BMI estimation, on Android devices
using the CLAID framework. We release our complete code for model training,
filtering, and the CLAID package for mobile deployment as open-source

Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) techniques have the potential in machine learning to
alleviate distribution differences between training and test sets by leveraging
information from source domains. In image classification, most advances in DA
have been made using natural images rather than medical data, which are harder
to work with. Moreover, even for natural images, the use of mainstream datasets
can lead to performance bias. {With the aim of better understanding the
benefits of DA for both natural and medical images, this study performs 557
simulation studies using seven widely-used DA techniques for image
classification in five natural and eight medical datasets that cover various
scenarios, such as out-of-distribution, dynamic data streams, and limited
training samples.} Our experiments yield detailed results and insightful
observations highlighting the performance and medical applicability of these
techniques. Notably, our results have shown the outstanding performance of the
Deep Subdomain Adaptation Network (DSAN) algorithm. This algorithm achieved
feasible classification accuracy (91.2\%) in the COVID-19 dataset using
Resnet50 and showed an important accuracy improvement in the dynamic data
stream DA scenario (+6.7\%) compared to the baseline. Our results also
demonstrate that DSAN exhibits remarkable level of explainability when
evaluated on COVID-19 and skin cancer datasets. These results contribute to the
understanding of DA techniques and offer valuable insight into the effective
adaptation of models to medical data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频目标检测面临运动模糊、遮挡和变形等图像退化问题，现有方法虽然通过特征聚合和复杂后处理提升了性能，但计算成本较高。需要在不增加推理计算负担的情况下提高对图像退化的鲁棒性

Method: 1) 使用对比损失实现对比学习辅助分支，增强主干网络的特征表示能力；2) 提出动态损失加权策略，训练初期强调辅助特征学习，训练收敛时逐渐优先检测任务

Result: 在ImageNet VID数据集上，使用ResNet-101达到84.0% mAP，使用ResNeXt-101达到85.2% mAP，实现了CNN模型的无后处理SOTA性能

Conclusion: CLAB方法通过简单的对比学习辅助分支和动态损失加权，有效提升了视频目标检测的性能，且无需额外的后处理方法和推理计算成本

Abstract: Video object detection is a challenging task because videos often suffer from
image deterioration such as motion blur, occlusion, and deformable shapes,
making it significantly more difficult than detecting objects in still images.
Prior approaches have improved video object detection performance by employing
feature aggregation and complex post-processing techniques, though at the cost
of increased computational demands. To improve robustness to image degradation
without additional computational load during inference, we introduce a
straightforward yet effective Contrastive Learning through Auxiliary Branch
(CLAB) method. First, we implement a constrastive auxiliary branch using a
contrastive loss to enhance the feature representation capability of the video
object detector's backbone. Next, we propose a dynamic loss weighting strategy
that emphasizes auxiliary feature learning early in training while gradually
prioritizing the detection task as training converges. We validate our approach
through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating
consistent performance gains. Without bells and whistles, CLAB reaches a
performance of 84.0% mAP and 85.2% mAP with ResNet-101 and ResNeXt-101,
respectively, on the ImageNet VID dataset, thus achieving state-of-the-art
performance for CNN-based models without requiring additional post-processing
methods.

TL;DR: 分析CLIP视觉编码器在排版攻击下的行为，发现专门处理排版信息的注意力头，提出无需微调的防御方法，通过选择性消融排版电路来提升模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 排版攻击通过向图像中注入文本来操纵多模态系统，导致目标错误分类、恶意内容生成和视觉语言模型越狱，需要有效防御方法。

Method: 定位CLIP模型中专门提取和传输排版信息的注意力头，构建排版电路，通过选择性消融这些注意力头来防御攻击，无需微调。

Result: 在ImageNet-100的排版变体上性能提升达19.6%，标准ImageNet-100准确率下降小于1%，与需要微调的最先进方法竞争力相当。

Conclusion: 发布了一系列抗排版攻击的dyslexic CLIP模型，可作为安全关键应用的即插即用替代方案，在文本识别效用与文本操纵风险之间提供更好平衡。

Abstract: Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into
images, leading to targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation
and even Vision-Language Model jailbreaks. In this work, we analyze how CLIP
vision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized
attention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract
and transmit typographic information to the cls token. Building on these
insights, we introduce a method to defend CLIP models against typographic
attacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention
heads. Without requiring finetuning, our method improves performance by up to
19.6% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard
ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Notably, our training-free approach
remains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that
rely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models
which are significantly more robust against typographic attacks. These models
serve as suitable drop-in replacements for a broad range of safety-critical
applications, where the risks of text-based manipulation outweigh the utility
of text recognition.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a crucial task in computer vision with
wide range of applications including human computer interaction, surveillance,
and assistive technologies. However, challenges such as occlusion, expression
variability, and lack of interpretability hinder the performance of traditional
FER systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful alternative by
modeling relational dependencies between facial landmarks, enabling structured
and interpretable learning. In this paper, we propose GLaRE, a novel
Graph-based Landmark Region Embedding network for emotion recognition. Facial
landmarks are extracted using 3D facial alignment, and a quotient graph is
constructed via hierarchical coarsening to preserve spatial structure while
reducing complexity. Our method achieves 64.89 percentage accuracy on AffectNet
and 94.24 percentage on FERG, outperforming several existing baselines.
Additionally, ablation studies have demonstrated that region-level embeddings
from quotient graphs have contributed to improved prediction performance.

Method: 提出FastFit框架，采用半注意力机制，用类别嵌入替代传统时间步嵌入，实现参考特征编码与去噪过程的完全解耦，参考特征只需计算一次即可在所有步骤中无损重用

Conclusion: FastFit通过创新的可缓存扩散架构成功解决了多参考虚拟试穿的效率和性能问题，为复杂虚拟试穿应用提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Despite its great potential, virtual try-on technology is hindered from
real-world application by two major challenges: the inability of current
methods to support multi-reference outfit compositions (including garments and
accessories), and their significant inefficiency caused by the redundant
re-computation of reference features in each denoising step. To address these
challenges, we propose FastFit, a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on
framework based on a novel cacheable diffusion architecture. By employing a
Semi-Attention mechanism and substituting traditional timestep embeddings with
class embeddings for reference items, our model fully decouples reference
feature encoding from the denoising process with negligible parameter overhead.
This allows reference features to be computed only once and losslessly reused
across all steps, fundamentally breaking the efficiency bottleneck and
achieving an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods. Furthermore, to
facilitate research on complex, multi-reference virtual try-on, we introduce
DressCode-MR, a new large-scale dataset. It comprises 28,179 sets of
high-quality, paired images covering five key categories (tops, bottoms,
dresses, shoes, and bags), constructed through a pipeline of expert models and
human feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD, DressCode,
and our DressCode-MR datasets show that FastFit surpasses state-of-the-art
methods on key fidelity metrics while offering its significant advantage in
inference efficiency.

Conclusion: UTA-Sign方法有效解决了低光照环境下交通标志感知的挑战，通过多模态融合提升了自动驾驶系统的环境理解能力

Abstract: The thermal camera excels at perceiving outdoor environments under low-light
conditions, making it ideal for applications such as nighttime autonomous
driving and unmanned navigation. However, thermal cameras encounter challenges
when capturing signage from objects made of similar materials, which can pose
safety risks for accurately understanding semantics in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast, the neuromorphic vision camera, also known as an event
camera, detects changes in light intensity asynchronously and has proven
effective in high-speed, low-light traffic environments. Recognizing the
complementary characteristics of these two modalities, this paper proposes
UTA-Sign, an unsupervised thermal-event video augmentation for traffic signage
in low-illumination environments, targeting elements such as license plates and
roadblock indicators. To address the signage blind spots of thermal imaging and
the non-uniform sampling of event cameras, we developed a dual-boosting
mechanism that fuses thermal frames and event signals for consistent signage
representation over time. The proposed method utilizes thermal frames to
provide accurate motion cues as temporal references for aligning the uneven
event signals. At the same time, event signals contribute subtle signage
content to the raw thermal frames, enhancing the overall understanding of the
environment. The proposed method is validated on datasets collected from
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior quality in traffic signage
sketching and improved detection accuracy at the perceptual level.

Abstract: Identifying sitters in historical paintings is a key task for art historians,
offering insight into their lives and how they chose to be seen. However, the
process is often subjective and limited by the lack of data and stylistic
variations. Automated facial recognition is capable of handling challenging
conditions and can assist, but while traditional facial recognition models
perform well on photographs, they struggle with paintings due to domain shift
and high intra-class variation. Artistic factors such as style, skill, intent,
and influence from other works further complicate recognition. In this work, we
investigate the potential of foundation models to improve facial recognition in
artworks. By fine-tuning foundation models and integrating their embeddings
with those from conventional facial recognition networks, we demonstrate
notable improvements over current state-of-the-art methods. Our results show
that foundation models can bridge the gap where traditional methods are
ineffective. Paper page at https://www.idiap.ch/paper/artface/

Conclusion: 提出的主动防御方法通过低频扰动有效破坏了深度伪造技术的生成过程，为对抗深度伪造攻击提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Deepfake technology, driven by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), poses
significant risks to privacy and societal security. Existing detection methods
are predominantly passive, focusing on post-event analysis without preventing
attacks. To address this, we propose an active defense method based on
low-frequency perceptual perturbations to disrupt face swapping manipulation,
reducing the performance and naturalness of generated content. Unlike prior
approaches that used low-frequency perturbations to impact classification
accuracy,our method directly targets the generative process of deepfake
techniques. We combine frequency and spatial domain features to strengthen
defenses. By introducing artifacts through low-frequency perturbations while
preserving high-frequency details, we ensure the output remains visually
plausible. Additionally, we design a complete architecture featuring an
encoder, a perturbation generator, and a decoder, leveraging discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to extract low-frequency components and generate perturbations
that disrupt facial manipulation models. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW
demonstrate significant reductions in face-swapping effectiveness, improved
defense success rates, and preservation of visual quality.

Abstract: Foundation image-text models such as CLIP with zero-shot capabilities enable
a wide array of applications. MobileCLIP is a recent family of image-text
models at 3-15ms latency and 50-150M parameters with state-of-the-art zero-shot
accuracy. The main ingredients in MobileCLIP were its low-latency and light
architectures and a novel multi-modal reinforced training that made knowledge
distillation from multiple caption-generators and CLIP teachers efficient,
scalable, and reproducible. In this paper, we improve the multi-modal
reinforced training of MobileCLIP through: 1) better CLIP teacher ensembles
trained on the DFN dataset, 2) improved captioner teachers trained on the DFN
dataset and fine-tuned on a diverse selection of high-quality image-caption
datasets. We discover new insights through ablations such as the importance of
temperature tuning in contrastive knowledge distillation, the effectiveness of
caption-generator fine-tuning for caption diversity, and the additive
improvement from combining synthetic captions generated by multiple models. We
train a new family of models called MobileCLIP2 and achieve state-of-the-art
ImageNet-1k zero-shot accuracies at low latencies. In particular, we observe
2.2% improvement in ImageNet-1k accuracy for MobileCLIP2-B compared with
MobileCLIP-B architecture. Notably, MobileCLIP2-S4 matches the zero-shot
accuracy of SigLIP-SO400M/14 on ImageNet-1k while being 2$\times$ smaller and
improves on DFN ViT-L/14 at 2.5$\times$ lower latency. We release our
pretrained models (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip) and the data
generation code (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip-dr). The data
generation code makes it easy to create new reinforced datasets with arbitrary
teachers using distributed scalable processing.

Abstract: Generating 3D human motions from text is a challenging yet valuable task. The
key aspects of this task are ensuring text-motion consistency and achieving
generation diversity. Although recent advancements have enabled the generation
of precise and high-quality human motions from text, achieving diversity in the
generated motions remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we aim to
overcome the above challenge by designing a simple yet effective text-to-motion
generation method, \textit{i.e.}, Diverse-T2M. Our method introduces
uncertainty into the generation process, enabling the generation of highly
diverse motions while preserving the semantic consistency of the text.
Specifically, we propose a novel perspective that utilizes noise signals as
carriers of diversity information in transformer-based methods, facilitating a
explicit modeling of uncertainty. Moreover, we construct a latent space where
text is projected into a continuous representation, instead of a rigid
one-to-one mapping, and integrate a latent space sampler to introduce
stochastic sampling into the generation process, thereby enhancing the
diversity and uncertainty of the outputs. Our results on text-to-motion
generation benchmark datasets~(HumanML3D and KIT-ML) demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances diversity while maintaining state-of-the-art
performance in text consistency.

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound images are inherently challenging to interpret in
liver surgery due to the limited field of view and complex anatomical
structures. Bridging the gap between preoperative and intraoperative data is
crucial for effective surgical guidance. 3D IntraVascular UltraSound (IVUS)
offers a potential solution by enabling the reconstruction of the entire organ,
which facilitates registration between preoperative computed tomography (CT)
scans and intraoperative IVUS images. In this work, we propose an
optimization-based calibration method using a 3D-printed phantom for accurate
3D Intravascular Ultrasound volume reconstruction. Our approach ensures precise
alignment of tracked IVUS data with preoperative CT images, improving
intraoperative navigation. We validated our method using in vivo swine liver
images, achieving a calibration error from 0.88 to 1.80 mm and a registration
error from 3.40 to 5.71 mm between the 3D IVUS data and the corresponding CT
scan. Our method provides a reliable and accurate means of calibration and
volume reconstruction. It can be used to register intraoperative ultrasound
images with preoperative CT images in the context of liver surgery, and enhance
intraoperative guidance.

Abstract: Generalizable Gaussian Splatting aims to synthesize novel views for unseen
scenes without per-scene optimization. In particular, recent advancements
utilize feed-forward networks to predict per-pixel Gaussian parameters,
enabling high-quality synthesis from sparse input views. However, existing
approaches fall short in encoding discriminative, multi-view consistent
features for Gaussian predictions, which struggle to construct accurate
geometry with sparse views. To address this, we propose $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS, a
framework that enhances feature learning by incorporating context-aware,
cross-dimension, and cross-scale constraints. Our architecture integrates three
lightweight modules into a unified rendering pipeline, improving feature fusion
and enabling photorealistic synthesis without requiring additional supervision.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate that $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS

Conclusion: PI-GenMFI方法能够有效生成合成MFI数据，为机器学习算法提供训练数据，优化半导体缺陷定位过程

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, defect detection and localization are
critical to ensuring product quality and yield. While X-ray imaging is a
reliable non-destructive testing method, it is memory-intensive and
time-consuming for large-scale scanning, Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) offers a
more efficient means to localize regions of interest (ROI) for targeted X-ray
scanning. However, the limited availability of MFI datasets due to proprietary
concerns presents a significant bottleneck for training machine learning (ML)
models using MFI. To address this challenge, we consider an ML-driven approach
leveraging diffusion models with two physical constraints. We propose Physics
Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images (PI-GenMFI) to generate
synthetic MFI samples by integrating specific physical information. We generate
MFI images for the most common defect types: power shorts. These synthetic
images will serve as training data for ML algorithms designed to localize
defect areas efficiently. To evaluate generated MFIs, we compare our model to
SOTA generative models from both variational autoencoder (VAE) and diffusion
methods. We present a domain expert evaluation to assess the generated samples.
In addition, we present qualitative and quantitative evaluation using various
metrics used for image generation and signal processing, showing promising
results to optimize the defect localization process.

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize objects in 3D scenes using
natural language descriptions. Although supervised methods achieve higher
accuracy in constrained settings, zero-shot 3DVG holds greater promise for
real-world applications since eliminating scene-specific training requirements.
However, existing zero-shot methods face challenges of spatial-limited
reasoning due to reliance on single-view localization, and contextual omissions
or detail degradation. To address these issues, we propose SeqVLM, a novel
zero-shot 3DVG framework that leverages multi-view real-world scene images with
spatial information for target object reasoning. Specifically, SeqVLM first
generates 3D instance proposals via a 3D semantic segmentation network and
refines them through semantic filtering, retaining only semantic-relevant
candidates. A proposal-guided multi-view projection strategy then projects
these candidate proposals onto real scene image sequences, preserving spatial
relationships and contextual details in the conversion process of 3D point
cloud to images. Furthermore, to mitigate VLM computational overload, we
implement a dynamic scheduling mechanism that iteratively processes
sequances-query prompts, leveraging VLM's cross-modal reasoning capabilities to
identify textually specified objects. Experiments on the ScanRefer and Nr3D
benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Acc@0.25 scores
of 55.6% and 53.2%, surpassing previous zero-shot methods by 4.0% and 5.2%,
respectively, which advance 3DVG toward greater generalization and real-world
applicability. The code is available at https://github.com/JiawLin/SeqVLM.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于GAN的进阶性特征优化攻击框架，能够在分开推理中更有效地恢复敏感输入数据，特别是在高分辨率和深层模型中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数据重构攻击方法仅在浅层模型中有效，且无法充分利用语义先验知识，导致重构质量和通用性受限。分开推理中交换的中间特征存在严重隐私风险。

Method: 设计了一种基于GAN的攻击框架，采用进阶性特征优化(PFO)技术，将生成器分解为层次块并逐步精炼中间表征。为了稳定优化过程和提高图像真实性，在重构过程中引入了L1-ball约束。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在高分辨率场景、分布外设置以及面对更深更复杂的DNN模型时，表现显著超过了之前的攻击方法。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的GAN-PFO框架能够有效解决分开推理中的隐私泄漏问题，为深度网络安全提供了新的攻击手段和防御研究方向。

Abstract: The growing complexity of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has led to the adoption
of Split Inference (SI), a collaborative paradigm that partitions computation
between edge devices and the cloud to reduce latency and protect user privacy.
However, recent advances in Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRAs) reveal that
intermediate features exchanged in SI can be exploited to recover sensitive
input data, posing significant privacy risks. Existing DRAs are typically
effective only on shallow models and fail to fully leverage semantic priors,
limiting their reconstruction quality and generalizability across datasets and
model architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based DRA framework
with Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO), which decomposes the generator
into hierarchical blocks and incrementally refines intermediate representations
to enhance the semantic fidelity of reconstructed images. To stabilize the
optimization and improve image realism, we introduce an L1-ball constraint
during reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
prior attacks by a large margin, especially in high-resolution scenarios,
out-of-distribution settings, and against deeper and more complex DNNs.

TL;DR: 研究CLIP模型在军事环境中对遮挡的鲁棒性，发现Transformer架构优于CNN，分散遮挡比连续遮挡影响更大，微调可显著提升抗遮挡能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP等视觉语言模型在零样本分类中表现出色，但在军事应用中的部分遮挡和低信噪比环境下的鲁棒性尚未充分研究，需要评估其在真实军事部署中的可靠性

Method: 使用包含18类军事车辆的自定义数据集，通过不同遮挡百分比评估CLIP变体的性能，采用归一化曲线下面积(NAUC)作为评估指标，比较Transformer和CNN架构，分析不同遮挡模式的影响

Result: 1) Transformer-based CLIP模型始终优于CNN；2) 细粒度分散遮挡比大面积连续遮挡对性能影响更大；3) 线性探测模型在约35%遮挡时性能急剧下降；4) 通过微调模型主干，性能下降点可推迟到60%以上遮挡

Conclusion: 研究强调了训练过程中遮挡特定增强的重要性，需要进一步探索补丁级敏感性和架构韧性，以确保CLIP在真实世界军事部署中的可靠性

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared embedding space, offering advantages for
defense applications with scarce labeled data. However, CLIP's robustness in
challenging military environments, with partial occlusion and degraded
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remains underexplored. We investigate CLIP
variants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle
classes and evaluate using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across
occlusion percentages. Four key insights emerge: (1) Transformer-based CLIP
models consistently outperform CNNs, (2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions
degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, (3) despite
improved accuracy, performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around
35% occlusion, (4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop
occurs at more than 60% occlusion. These results underscore the importance of
occlusion-specific augmentations during training and the need for further
exploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for
real-world deployment of CLIP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在控制灵活性、运动自然度和表情质量方面存在局限，且现有数据集主要在实验室环境下采集，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出扩散模型框架EmoCAST，包含文本引导解耦情感模块进行外观建模，情感音频注意力模块捕捉情感与音频的交互，并构建情感说话头数据集，采用情感感知采样训练和渐进功能训练策略。

Result: EmoCAST在生成真实、情感丰富且音频同步的说话头视频方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了情感说话头合成中的关键挑战，为实际应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Emotional talking head synthesis aims to generate talking portrait videos
with vivid expressions. Existing methods still exhibit limitations in control
flexibility, motion naturalness, and expression quality. Moreover, currently
available datasets are primarily collected in lab settings, further
exacerbating these shortcomings. Consequently, these limitations substantially
hinder practical applications in real-world scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose EmoCAST, a diffusion-based framework with two key
modules for precise text-driven emotional synthesis. In appearance modeling,
emotional prompts are integrated through a text-guided decoupled emotive
module, enhancing the spatial knowledge to improve emotion comprehension. To
improve the relationship between audio and emotion, we introduce an emotive
audio attention module to capture the interplay between controlled emotion and
driving audio, generating emotion-aware features to guide more precise facial
motion synthesis. Additionally, we construct an emotional talking head dataset
with comprehensive emotive text descriptions to optimize the framework's
performance. Based on the proposed dataset, we propose an emotion-aware
sampling training strategy and a progressive functional training strategy that
further improve the model's ability to capture nuanced expressive features and
achieve accurate lip-synchronization. Overall, EmoCAST achieves
state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, emotionally expressive,
and audio-synchronized talking-head videos. Project Page:

Abstract: Focusing on the development of an end-to-end autonomous vehicle model with
pixel-to-pixel context awareness, this research proposes the SKGE-Swin
architecture. This architecture utilizes the Swin Transformer with a skip-stage
mechanism to broaden feature representation globally and at various network
levels. This approach enables the model to extract information from distant
pixels by leveraging the Swin Transformer's Shifted Window-based Multi-head
Self-Attention (SW-MSA) mechanism and to retain critical information from the
initial to the final stages of feature extraction, thereby enhancing its
capability to comprehend complex patterns in the vehicle's surroundings. The
model is evaluated on the CARLA platform using adversarial scenarios to
simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the
SKGE-Swin architecture achieves a superior Driving Score compared to previous
methods. Furthermore, an ablation study will be conducted to evaluate the
contribution of each architectural component, including the influence of skip
connections and the use of the Swin Transformer, in improving model
performance.

Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in
women, and early detection is essential for improving outcomes. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is a highly sensitive tool for breast cancer detection,
particularly in women at high risk or with dense breast tissue, where
mammography is less effective. The ODELIA consortium organized a multi-center
challenge to foster AI-based solutions for breast cancer diagnosis and
classification. The dataset included 511 studies from six European centers,
acquired on scanners from multiple vendors at both 1.5 T and 3 T. Each study
was labeled for the left and right breast as no lesion, benign lesion, or
malignant lesion. We developed a SwinUNETR-based deep learning framework that
incorporates breast region masking, extensive data augmentation, and ensemble
learning to improve robustness and generalizability. Our method achieved second
place on the challenge leaderboard, highlighting its potential to support
clinical breast MRI interpretation. We publicly share our codebase at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够识别抽象概念（如正义、自由、团结），而现有视频理解技术主要关注具体实体识别。抽象概念识别是视频理解的关键开放挑战，需要基于上下文信息进行多层次的语义推理。

Method: 通过调查研究和文献综述，分析不同任务和数据集，总结社区数十年的经验，探讨如何利用多模态基础模型来解决抽象概念理解问题。

Conclusion: 在基础模型时代重新审视抽象概念理解这一重大挑战时，借鉴社区长期积累的经验将有助于避免重复工作，推动模型更好地与人类推理和价值观对齐。

Abstract: The automatic understanding of video content is advancing rapidly. Empowered
by deeper neural networks and large datasets, machines are increasingly capable
of understanding what is concretely visible in video frames, whether it be
objects, actions, events, or scenes. In comparison, humans retain a unique
ability to also look beyond concrete entities and recognize abstract concepts
like justice, freedom, and togetherness. Abstract concept recognition forms a
crucial open challenge in video understanding, where reasoning on multiple
semantic levels based on contextual information is key. In this paper, we argue
that the recent advances in foundation models make for an ideal setting to
address abstract concept understanding in videos. Automated understanding of
high-level abstract concepts is imperative as it enables models to be more
aligned with human reasoning and values. In this survey, we study different
tasks and datasets used to understand abstract concepts in video content. We
observe that, periodically and over a long period, researchers have attempted
to solve these tasks, making the best use of the tools available at their
disposal. We advocate that drawing on decades of community experience will help
us shed light on this important open grand challenge and avoid ``re-inventing
the wheel'' as we start revisiting it in the era of multi-modal foundation
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AvatarBack是一个用于3D高斯头像重建的即插即用框架，通过生成身份一致的后视图伪图像和自适应空间对齐策略，解决了现有方法因依赖前视图图像而导致后头部重建质量差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于高斯泼溅的头像重建方法主要依赖前视图图像，导致后头部区域重建质量差，出现几何不一致、结构模糊和真实感降低等问题，限制了重建头像的保真度。

Method: 提出AvatarBack框架，包含两个核心技术：主题特定生成器（SSG）利用生成先验从稀疏前视图输入合成身份一致的后视图伪图像；自适应空间对齐策略（ASA）使用可学习的变换矩阵在训练期间优化，实现合成视图与3D高斯表示之间的精确几何对齐。

Result: 在NeRSemble和K-hairstyle数据集上的大量实验表明，AvatarBack显著提升了后头部重建质量，同时保持了前视图保真度，重建的头像在不同运动下保持一致的视觉真实感且完全可动画化。

Conclusion: AvatarBack通过显式建模缺失的后头部区域，成功解决了3D高斯头像重建中的后头部质量问题，为构建完整一致的头像提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have significantly boosted the
reconstruction of head avatars, enabling high-quality facial modeling by
representing an 3D avatar as a collection of 3D Gaussians. However, existing
methods predominantly rely on frontal-view images, leaving the back-head poorly
constructed. This leads to geometric inconsistencies, structural blurring, and
reduced realism in the rear regions, ultimately limiting the fidelity of
reconstructed avatars. To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a
novel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and
consistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head
regions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the
Subject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy
(ASA). The former leverages a generative prior to synthesize
identity-consistent, plausible back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal
inputs, providing robust multi-view supervision. To achieve precise geometric
alignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the
later employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training,
effectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies. Extensive
experiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets, evaluated using geometric,
photometric, and GPT-4o-based perceptual metrics, demonstrate that AvatarBack
significantly enhances back-head reconstruction quality while preserving
frontal fidelity. Moreover, the reconstructed avatars maintain consistent
visual realism under diverse motions and remain fully animatable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐方法依赖外部数据集、人工标注或复杂后处理，限制了可扩展性并增加了成本，需要更有效的多模态对齐解决方案

Method: 生成去偏自评分数作为自评估指标，通过模型内部生成而非依赖外部资源，改进解码策略和偏好调优过程

Result: 显著减少幻觉、增强安全性并提升整体能力，在实证结果中明显优于传统方法

Conclusion: 该方法为LVLMs对齐提供了更有效的解决方案，实现了自主改进对齐的能力

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have opened up new opportunities for integrating
visual and linguistic modalities. However, effectively aligning these
modalities remains challenging, often leading to hallucinations--where
generated outputs are not grounded in the visual input--and raising safety
concerns across various domains. Existing alignment methods, such as
instruction tuning and preference tuning, often rely on external datasets,
human annotations, or complex post-processing, which limit scalability and
increase costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
generates the debiased self-judgment score, a self-evaluation metric created
internally by the model without relying on external resources. This enables the
model to autonomously improve alignment. Our method enhances both decoding
strategies and preference tuning processes, resulting in reduced
hallucinations, enhanced safety, and improved overall capability. Empirical
results show that our approach significantly outperforms traditional methods,
offering a more effective solution for aligning LVLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在涂鸦这种高对比度、抽象的媒介中，面部特征的细微扭曲会消除主体的可识别性，破坏个人和文化真实性，因此需要解决极端风格变换中的身份保持问题。

Method: 使用LoRA微调的预训练扩散变换器进行涂鸦风格迁移，通过面部一致性自注意力机制增强身份嵌入，采用CLIP引导的提示扩展实现无关键点的姿态定制。

Result: 定量结果显示具有竞争力的面部特征一致性和最先进的美学及人类偏好评分，定性分析和现场部署证明了系统的实际创作影响。

Conclusion: CraftGraffiti推进了身份尊重的AI辅助艺术目标，为创造性AI应用中融合风格自由和可识别性提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Preserving facial identity under extreme stylistic transformation remains a
major challenge in generative art. In graffiti, a high-contrast, abstract
medium, subtle distortions to the eyes, nose, or mouth can erase the subject's
recognizability, undermining both personal and cultural authenticity. We
present CraftGraffiti, an end-to-end text-guided graffiti generation framework
designed with facial feature preservation as a primary objective. Given an
input image and a style and pose descriptive prompt, CraftGraffiti first
applies graffiti style transfer via LoRA-fine-tuned pretrained diffusion
transformer, then enforces identity fidelity through a face-consistent
self-attention mechanism that augments attention layers with explicit identity
embeddings. Pose customization is achieved without keypoints, using CLIP-guided
prompt extension to enable dynamic re-posing while retaining facial coherence.
We formally justify and empirically validate the "style-first, identity-after"
paradigm, showing it reduces attribute drift compared to the reverse order.
Quantitative results demonstrate competitive facial feature consistency and
state-of-the-art aesthetic and human preference scores, while qualitative
analyses and a live deployment at the Cruilla Festival highlight the system's
real-world creative impact. CraftGraffiti advances the goal of
identity-respectful AI-assisted artistry, offering a principled approach for
blending stylistic freedom with recognizability in creative AI applications.

Conclusion: 该方法有助于降低误诊风险，提高诊断可靠性和患者安全性，为医生和患者提供必要的警告

Abstract: Recent advancements in skin lesion classification models have significantly
improved accuracy, with some models even surpassing dermatologists' diagnostic
performance. However, in medical practice, distrust in AI models remains a
challenge. Beyond high accuracy, trustworthy, explainable diagnoses are
essential. Existing explainability methods have reliability issues, with
LIME-based methods suffering from inconsistency, while CAM-based methods
failing to consider all classes. To address these limitations, we propose
Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation, a method that analyses
all classes' activation probability maps probabilistically and at a pixel
level. By visualizing the diagnostic process in a unified manner, it helps
reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Furthermore, the application of SafeML
enhances the detection of false diagnoses and issues warnings to doctors and
patients as needed, improving diagnostic reliability and ultimately patient
safety. We evaluated our method using the ISIC datasets with MobileNetV2 and
Vision Transformers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言语义的一个基本方面是能够从已知部分组合成新的含义。虽然视觉语言模型(VLMs)取得了显著进展，但有证据表明它们无法进行这种组合推理，比如CLIP在处理属性组合时容易出现错误。

Method: 评估三种模型（扩散分类器、CLIP和ViLT）在零样本学习(ZSL)和广义零样本学习(GZSL)设置下绑定对象属性和关系的能力。分析了CLIP嵌入表示以探究困难来源。

Result: 扩散分类器和ViLT在概念绑定任务上表现良好，但所有模型在关系GZSL任务上都显著困难。CLIP嵌入分析表明，困难可能源于关系概念（如左右）的表示过于相似。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在组合泛化方面相比判别模型有所改进，但所有视觉语言模型在关系推理方面仍面临重大挑战，需要进一步改进关系概念的表示学习。

Abstract: A fundamental aspect of the semantics of natural language is that novel
meanings can be formed from the composition of previously known parts.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent years,
however, there is evidence that they are unable to perform this kind of
composition. For example, given an image of a red cube and a blue cylinder, a
VLM such as CLIP is likely to incorrectly label the image as a red cylinder or
a blue cube, indicating it represents the image as a `bag-of-words' and fails
to capture compositional semantics. Diffusion models have recently gained
significant attention for their impressive generative abilities, and zero-shot
classifiers based on diffusion models have been shown to perform competitively
with CLIP in certain compositional tasks. In this work we explore whether the
generative Diffusion Classifier has improved compositional generalisation
abilities compared to discriminative models. We assess three models --
Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT -- on their ability to bind objects with
attributes and relations in both zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalised
zero-shot learning (GZSL) settings. Our results show that the Diffusion
Classifier and ViLT perform well at concept binding tasks, but that all models
struggle significantly with the relational GZSL task, underscoring the broader
challenges VLMs face with relational reasoning. Analysis of CLIP embeddings
suggests that the difficulty may stem from overly similar representations of
relational concepts such as left and right. Code and dataset are available at:

Result: 在图像引导和多模态引导数据上训练的模型对真实内容泛化能力更强，因为保留了视觉上下文。但整体性能仍然有限。

Conclusion: 推断意图具有复杂性，需要专门的架构来解决这一挑战，当前方法在意图识别方面仍有较大提升空间。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal AI have enabled progress in detecting synthetic
and out-of-context content. However, existing efforts largely overlook the
intent behind AI-generated images. To fill this gap, we introduce S-HArM, a
multimodal dataset for intent-aware classification, comprising 9,576 "in the
wild" image-text pairs from Twitter/X and Reddit, labeled as Humor/Satire, Art,
or Misinformation. Additionally, we explore three prompting strategies
(image-guided, description-guided, and multimodally-guided) to construct a
large-scale synthetic training dataset with Stable Diffusion. We conduct an
extensive comparative study including modality fusion, contrastive learning,
reconstruction networks, attention mechanisms, and large vision-language
models. Our results show that models trained on image- and multimodally-guided
data generalize better to "in the wild" content, due to preserved visual
context. However, overall performance remains limited, highlighting the
complexity of inferring intent and the need for specialized architectures.

Result: 在室内外数据集上证明了模型相对于最先进方法的优越性和鲁棒性能

Conclusion: 提出的surfel-based pose learning regression方法能够有效解决点云配准中的噪声和旋转敏感问题，具有优异的性能表现

Abstract: Point cloud registration is crucial for ensuring 3D alignment consistency of
multiple local point clouds in 3D reconstruction for remote sensing or digital
heritage. While various point cloud-based registration methods exist, both
non-learning and learning-based, they ignore point orientations and point
uncertainties, making the model susceptible to noisy input and aggressive
rotations of the input point cloud like orthogonal transformation; thus, it
necessitates extensive training point clouds with transformation augmentations.
To address these issues, we propose a novel surfel-based pose learning
regression approach. Our method can initialize surfels from Lidar point cloud
using virtual perspective camera parameters, and learns explicit
$\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant features, including both position and rotation
through $\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant convolutional kernels to predict relative
transformation between source and target scans. The model comprises an
equivariant convolutional encoder, a cross-attention mechanism for similarity
computation, a fully-connected decoder, and a non-linear Huber loss.
Experimental results on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate our model
superiority and robust performance on real point-cloud scans compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 在三个大规模基准测试中优于最先进模型，在可解释性、用户信任和泛化能力方面获得显著提升

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式解耦因果推理与答案生成，提供了透明且逻辑连贯的推理过程，CCE可作为跨领域可重用的因果推理引擎

Abstract: Existing Causal-Why Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models often struggle
with higher-order reasoning, relying on opaque, monolithic pipelines that
entangle video understanding, causal inference, and answer generation. These
black-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on
shallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular framework that explicitly
decouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language
causal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human
cognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level
video content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and
logically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal
Chain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs,
and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in
these chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a
scalable method for generating high-quality causal chains from existing
datasets using large language models. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluation
metric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art
models, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and
generalization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engine
across diverse domains. Project page:

TL;DR: 提出动态路由自编码器和速率控制代理的神经视频压缩框架，实现可变比特率控制，在保持RD性能的同时达到14.8%的BD-Rate降低和0.47dB的BD-PSNR提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经视频压缩中精确速率控制的挑战，因为基于学习的编解码器存在固有局限性，需要为可变比特率场景设计解决方案。

Method: 1) 动态路由自编码器：具有可变编码路径，每条路径占用部分计算复杂度并对应不同的RD权衡；2) 速率控制代理：实时估计每条路径的比特率并调整编码路径；3) 联合路径优化策略：实现各种路径的协同训练。

Result: 在HEVC和UVG数据集上，平均BD-Rate降低14.8%，BD-PSNR提升0.47dB，平均比特率误差仅为1.66%，实现了各种比特率和比特率受限应用的RDCO优化。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了神经视频压缩中的速率控制问题，在保持优异RD性能的同时实现了精确的比特率控制，为可变比特率应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Neural Video Compression (NVC) has achieved remarkable performance in recent
years. However, precise rate control remains a challenge due to the inherent
limitations of learning-based codecs. To solve this issue, we propose a dynamic
video compression framework designed for variable bitrate scenarios. First, to
achieve variable bitrate implementation, we propose the Dynamic-Route
Autoencoder with variable coding routes, each occupying partial computational
complexity of the whole network and navigating to a distinct RD trade-off.
Second, to approach the target bitrate, the Rate Control Agent estimates the
bitrate of each route and adjusts the coding route of DRA at run time. To
encompass a broad spectrum of variable bitrates while preserving overall RD
performance, we employ the Joint-Routes Optimization strategy, achieving
collaborative training of various routes. Extensive experiments on the HEVC and
UVG datasets show that the proposed method achieves an average BD-Rate
reduction of 14.8% and BD-PSNR gain of 0.47dB over state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining an average bitrate error of 1.66%, achieving
Rate-Distortion-Complexity Optimization (RDCO) for various bitrate and
bitrate-constrained applications. Our code is available at

Abstract: Accurate cardiac motion estimation from cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
images is vital for assessing cardiac function and detecting its abnormalities.
Existing methods often struggle to capture heart motion accurately because they
rely on intensity-based image registration similarity losses that may overlook
cardiac anatomical regions. To address this, we propose CardioMorphNet, a
recurrent Bayesian deep learning framework for 3D cardiac shape-guided
deformable registration using short-axis (SAX) CMR images. It employs a
recurrent variational autoencoder to model spatio-temporal dependencies over
the cardiac cycle and two posterior models for bi-ventricular segmentation and
motion estimation. The derived loss function from the Bayesian formulation
guides the framework to focus on anatomical regions by recursively registering
segmentation maps without using intensity-based image registration similarity
loss, while leveraging sequential SAX volumes and spatio-temporal features. The
Bayesian modelling also enables computation of uncertainty maps for the
estimated motion fields. Validated on the UK Biobank dataset by comparing
warped mask shapes with ground truth masks, CardioMorphNet demonstrates
superior performance in cardiac motion estimation, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Uncertainty assessment shows that it also yields
lower uncertainty values for estimated motion fields in the cardiac region
compared with other probabilistic-based cardiac registration methods,
indicating higher confidence in its predictions.

Result: 不仅提高了模拟精度，还相比传统蒙特卡洛方法实现了显著的速度提升

Conclusion: ExpertSim为CERN粒子物理实验中的高效探测器模拟提供了一个有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Simulating detector responses is a crucial part of understanding the inner
workings of particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Such
simulations are currently performed with statistical Monte Carlo methods, which
are computationally expensive and put a significant strain on CERN's
computational grid. Therefore, recent proposals advocate for generative machine
learning methods to enable more efficient simulations. However, the
distribution of the data varies significantly across the simulations, which is
hard to capture with out-of-the-box methods. In this study, we present
ExpertSim - a deep learning simulation approach tailored for the Zero Degree
Calorimeter in the ALICE experiment. Our method utilizes a
Mixture-of-Generative-Experts architecture, where each expert specializes in
simulating a different subset of the data. This allows for a more precise and
efficient generation process, as each expert focuses on a specific aspect of
the calorimeter response. ExpertSim not only improves accuracy, but also
provides a significant speedup compared to the traditional Monte-Carlo methods,
offering a promising solution for high-efficiency detector simulations in
particle physics experiments at CERN. We make the code available at

Motivation: 非典型有丝分裂图像(AMFs)是重要的组织病理学标志物，但在不同扫描仪、染色和采集条件导致的域偏移下难以保持一致的识别准确性

Method: 1) 在骨干网络早期和中期插入风格扰动增加特征多样性；2) 使用弱域标签通过辅助对齐损失对齐注意力精炼特征；3) 通过温度缩放KL散度从EMA教师模型蒸馏以稳定预测

Result: 在MIDOG 2025初步排行榜上获得：平衡准确率0.8762、灵敏度0.8873、特异性0.8651、ROC AUC 0.9499

Conclusion: 该方法推理开销可忽略，仅需粗略域元数据，提供强大且平衡的性能，是MIDOG 2025挑战赛的有竞争力方案

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are important histopathological markers yet
remain challenging to identify consistently, particularly under domain shift
stemming from scanner, stain, and acquisition differences. We present a simple
training-time recipe for domain-robust AMF classification in MIDOG 2025 Task 2.
The approach (i) increases feature diversity via style perturbations inserted
at early and mid backbone stages, (ii) aligns attention-refined features across
sites using weak domain labels (Scanner, Origin, Species, Tumor) through an
auxiliary alignment loss, and (iii) stabilizes predictions by distilling from
an exponential moving average (EMA) teacher with temperature-scaled KL
divergence. On the organizer-run preliminary leaderboard for atypical mitosis
classification, our submission attains balanced accuracy of 0.8762, sensitivity
of 0.8873, specificity of 0.8651, and ROC AUC of 0.9499. The method incurs
negligible inference-time overhead, relies only on coarse domain metadata, and
delivers strong, balanced performance, positioning it as a competitive

Motivation: 现有的点式奖励模型容易受到奖励攻击，小的分数差异经过标准化后会被放大，导致模型过分优化突破性改进

Method: 提出Pref-GRPO方法，使用对比偏好模型进行图像两两比较，以胜率作为奖励信号，将优化目标从分数最大化转向偏好拟合

Result: 实验表明Pref-GRPO能够区分细微的图像质量差异，提供更稳定的优势，有效减轻奖励攻击问题

Conclusion: 该研究成功地解决了T2I生成中的奖励攻击问题，并通过UniGenBench标准化了模型评估，为文本到图像生成领域提供了更可靠的评测基准

Abstract: Recent advancements highlight the importance of GRPO-based reinforcement
learning methods and benchmarking in enhancing text-to-image (T2I) generation.
However, current methods using pointwise reward models (RM) for scoring
generated images are susceptible to reward hacking. We reveal that this happens
when minimal score differences between images are amplified after
normalization, creating illusory advantages that drive the model to
over-optimize for trivial gains, ultimately destabilizing the image generation
process. To address this, we propose Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference
reward-based GRPO method that shifts the optimization objective from score
maximization to preference fitting, ensuring more stable training. In
Pref-GRPO, images are pairwise compared within each group using preference RM,
and the win rate is used as the reward signal. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PREF-GRPO differentiates subtle image quality differences,
providing more stable advantages and mitigating reward hacking. Additionally,
existing T2I benchmarks are limited by coarse evaluation criteria, hindering
comprehensive model assessment. To solve this, we introduce UniGenBench, a
unified T2I benchmark comprising 600 prompts across 5 main themes and 20
subthemes. It evaluates semantic consistency through 10 primary and 27
sub-criteria, leveraging MLLM for benchmark construction and evaluation. Our
benchmarks uncover the strengths and weaknesses of both open and closed-source
T2I models and validate the effectiveness of Pref-GRPO.

Motivation: 现有学术基准与工业实践存在严重差异，训练源同质化且测试图像质量低，阻碍了检测器的实际部署

Method: 构建分层泛化测试的HydraFake数据集；提出基于MLLM的Veritas检测器，采用模式感知推理（规划和自我反思）模拟人类取证过程；设计两阶段训练管道

Result: 传统检测器在跨模型场景表现良好但在未见伪造技术和数据域上不足；Veritas在不同OOD场景取得显著提升，能提供透明可信的检测输出

Conclusion: HydraFake数据集有效模拟真实世界挑战，Veritas通过模式感知推理显著提升深度伪造检测的泛化能力和可解释性

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and
evolving nature of fake content in real-world scenarios. However, existing
academic benchmarks suffer from severe discrepancies from industrial practice,
typically featuring homogeneous training sources and low-quality testing
images, which hinder the practical deployments of current detectors. To
mitigate this gap, we introduce HydraFake, a dataset that simulates real-world
challenges with hierarchical generalization testing. Specifically, HydraFake
involves diversified deepfake techniques and in-the-wild forgeries, along with
rigorous training and evaluation protocol, covering unseen model architectures,
emerging forgery techniques and novel data domains. Building on this resource,
we propose Veritas, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) based deepfake
detector. Different from vanilla chain-of-thought (CoT), we introduce
pattern-aware reasoning that involves critical reasoning patterns such as
"planning" and "self-reflection" to emulate human forensic process. We further
propose a two-stage training pipeline to seamlessly internalize such deepfake
reasoning capacities into current MLLMs. Experiments on HydraFake dataset
reveal that although previous detectors show great generalization on
cross-model scenarios, they fall short on unseen forgeries and data domains.
Our Veritas achieves significant gains across different OOD scenarios, and is
capable of delivering transparent and faithful detection outputs.

Motivation: 当前深度伪造检测方法主要针对完全合成的内容，对于局部细微修改的部分伪造视频存在检测能力空白，这类伪造更具欺骗性且难以识别。

Method: 提出了FakePartsBench基准数据集，包含超过25,000个视频，提供像素级和帧级操作标注，用于全面评估检测方法。通过用户研究和现有检测模型测试验证部分伪造的检测难度。

Result: 用户研究表明FakeParts将人类检测准确率降低了30%以上，最先进的检测模型也出现类似的性能下降，揭示了当前检测方法的严重漏洞。

Conclusion: 这项工作发现了当前深度伪造检测方法的关键漏洞，并为开发更强大的部分视频操作检测方法提供了必要的资源和基准数据集。

Abstract: We introduce FakeParts, a new class of deepfakes characterized by subtle,
localized manipulations to specific spatial regions or temporal segments of
otherwise authentic videos. Unlike fully synthetic content, these partial
manipulations, ranging from altered facial expressions to object substitutions
and background modifications, blend seamlessly with real elements, making them
particularly deceptive and difficult to detect. To address the critical gap in
detection capabilities, we present FakePartsBench, the first large-scale
benchmark dataset specifically designed to capture the full spectrum of partial
deepfakes. Comprising over 25K videos with pixel-level and frame-level
manipulation annotations, our dataset enables comprehensive evaluation of
detection methods. Our user studies demonstrate that FakeParts reduces human
detection accuracy by over 30% compared to traditional deepfakes, with similar
performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art detection models. This
work identifies an urgent vulnerability in current deepfake detection
approaches and provides the necessary resources to develop more robust methods
for partial video manipulations.

Abstract: Accurate dental caries detection from panoramic X-rays plays a pivotal role
in preventing lesion progression. However, current detection methods often
yield suboptimal accuracy due to subtle contrast variations and diverse lesion
morphology of dental caries. In this work, inspired by the clinical workflow
where dentists systematically combine whole-image screening with detailed
tooth-level inspection, we present DVCTNet, a novel Dual-View Co-Training
network for accurate dental caries detection. Our DVCTNet starts with employing
automated tooth detection to establish two complementary views: a global view
from panoramic X-ray images and a local view from cropped tooth images. We then
pretrain two vision foundation models separately on the two views. The
global-view foundation model serves as the detection backbone, generating
region proposals and global features, while the local-view model extracts
detailed features from corresponding cropped tooth patches matched by the
region proposals. To effectively integrate information from both views, we
introduce a Gated Cross-View Attention (GCV-Atten) module that dynamically
fuses dual-view features, enhancing the detection pipeline by integrating the
fused features back into the detection model for final caries detection. To
rigorously evaluate our DVCTNet, we test it on a public dataset and further
validate its performance on a newly curated, high-precision dental caries
detection dataset, annotated using both intra-oral images and panoramic X-rays
for double verification. Experimental results demonstrate DVCTNet's superior
performance against existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both datasets,
indicating the clinical applicability of our method. Our code and labeled
dataset are available at https://github.com/ShanghaiTech-IMPACT/DVCTNet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VIF方法主要关注图像质量优化，虽然近期研究开始引入语义分割和目标检测等下游任务，但这些方法需要大量标注或在高密度场景中面临边界框重叠和遮挡问题。RGB-T人群计数虽受关注但尚未与VIF整合。

Method: 提出多任务学习框架FusionCounting，将人群计数集成到VIF过程中。采用动态损失函数权重策略加速收敛和平衡任务贡献，并引入对抗训练增强模型鲁棒性。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，FusionCounting不仅提升了图像融合质量，还实现了更优越的人群计数性能。

Conclusion: 人群计数为VIF提供了直接定量的人口密度信息，且标注需求最小，特别适合密集场景。该框架通过多任务设计实现了图像融合和人群计数的互利共赢。

Abstract: Most visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) methods focus primarily on
optimizing fused image quality. Recent studies have begun incorporating
downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, to
provide semantic guidance for VIF. However, semantic segmentation requires
extensive annotations, while object detection, despite reducing annotation
efforts compared with segmentation, faces challenges in highly crowded scenes
due to overlapping bounding boxes and occlusion. Moreover, although RGB-T crowd
counting has gained increasing attention in recent years, no studies have
integrated VIF and crowd counting into a unified framework. To address these
challenges, we propose FusionCounting, a novel multi-task learning framework
that integrates crowd counting into the VIF process. Crowd counting provides a
direct quantitative measure of population density with minimal annotation,
making it particularly suitable for dense scenes. Our framework leverages both
input images and population density information in a mutually beneficial
multi-task design. To accelerate convergence and balance tasks contributions,
we introduce a dynamic loss function weighting strategy. Furthermore, we
incorporate adversarial training to enhance the robustness of both VIF and
crowd counting, improving the model's stability and resilience to adversarial
attacks. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that
FusionCounting not only enhances image fusion quality but also achieves
superior crowd counting performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel pipeline for 2D keypoint estima- tion of surgical
tools by leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) fine- tuned using a low rank
adjusting (LoRA) technique. Unlike traditional Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) or Transformer-based approaches, which often suffer from overfitting in
small-scale medical datasets, our method harnesses the generalization
capabilities of pre-trained VLMs. We carefully design prompts to create an

keypoint descriptions. Experimental results show that with only two epochs of
fine tuning, the adapted VLM outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating the
ef- fectiveness of LoRA in low-resource scenarios. This approach not only
improves keypoint detection performance, but also paves the way for future work

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) has been recently explored to enhance the
generalizability of Point Cloud Classification (PCC) models toward unseen
domains. Prior works are based on convolutional networks, Transformer or Mamba
architectures, either suffering from limited receptive fields or high
computational cost, or insufficient long-range dependency modeling. RWKV, as an
emerging architecture, possesses superior linear complexity, global receptive
fields, and long-range dependency. In this paper, we present the first work
that studies the generalizability of RWKV models in DG PCC. We find that
directly applying RWKV to DG PCC encounters two significant challenges: RWKV's
fixed direction token shift methods, like Q-Shift, introduce spatial
distortions when applied to unstructured point clouds, weakening local
geometric modeling and reducing robustness. In addition, the Bi-WKV attention
in RWKV amplifies slight cross-domain differences in key distributions through
exponential weighting, leading to attention shifts and degraded generalization.
To this end, we propose PointDGRWKV, the first RWKV-based framework tailored
for DG PCC. It introduces two key modules to enhance spatial modeling and
cross-domain robustness, while maintaining RWKV's linear efficiency. In
particular, we present Adaptive Geometric Token Shift to model local
neighborhood structures to improve geometric context awareness. In addition,
Cross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment is designed to mitigate
attention drift by aligning key feature distributions across domains. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PointDGRWKV achieves
state-of-the-art performance on DG PCC.

Abstract: Deep learning based automated pathological diagnosis has markedly improved
diagnostic efficiency and reduced variability between observers, yet its
clinical adoption remains limited by opaque model decisions and a lack of
traceable rationale. To address this, recent multimodal visual reasoning
architectures provide a unified framework that generates segmentation masks at
the pixel level alongside semantically aligned textual explanations. By
localizing lesion regions and producing expert style diagnostic narratives,
these models deliver the transparent and interpretable insights necessary for
dependable AI assisted pathology. Building on these advancements, we propose
PathMR, a cell-level Multimodal visual Reasoning framework for Pathological
image analysis. Given a pathological image and a textual query, PathMR
generates expert-level diagnostic explanations while simultaneously predicting
cell distribution patterns. To benchmark its performance, we evaluated our
approach on the publicly available PathGen dataset as well as on our newly
developed GADVR dataset. Extensive experiments on these two datasets
demonstrate that PathMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art visual
reasoning methods in text generation quality, segmentation accuracy, and
cross-modal alignment. These results highlight the potential of PathMR for
improving interpretability in AI-driven pathological diagnosis. The code will

Conclusion: 建立了自动化PDAC检测的稳健流程，可增强病理学家能力，并为其他癌症类型检测提供基础，同时对有限医疗影像数据集的深度学习应用提供了宝贵见解

Abstract: Pacreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal forms
of cancer, with a five-year survival rate below 10% primarily due to late
detection. This research develops and validates a deep learning framework for
early PDAC detection through analysis of dual-modality imaging:
autofluorescence and second harmonic generation (SHG). We analyzed 40 unique
patient samples to create a specialized neural network capable of
distinguishing between normal, fibrotic, and cancerous tissue. Our methodology
evaluated six distinct deep learning architectures, comparing traditional
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with modern Vision Transformers (ViTs).
Through systematic experimentation, we identified and overcome significant
challenges in medical image analysis, including limited dataset size and class
imbalance. The final optimized framework, based on a modified ResNet
architecture with frozen pre-trained layers and class-weighted training,
achieved over 90% accuracy in cancer detection. This represents a significant
improvement over current manual analysis methods an demonstrates potential for
clinical deployment. This work establishes a robust pipeline for automated PDAC
detection that can augment pathologists' capabilities while providing a
foundation for future expansion to other cancer types. The developed
methodology also offers valuable insights for applying deep learning to
limited-size medical imaging datasets, a common challenge in clinical
applications.

*Pushkar Shukla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一系列基于反事实推理的框架，用于解释、审计和减少视觉分类器和生成模型中的偏见。包括CAVLI、ASAC、TIBET、BiasConnect和InterMit等方法，通过系统性改变语义属性来探索偏见和建立更健壮的系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反事实推理在可解释和公平AI中趋于核心地位，需要发展框架来解释、审计和减少视觉分类器和生成模型中的偏见问题。

Method: 使用反事实推理方法，系统性地改变语义有意义的属性同时保持其他属性不变。CAVLI结合归因分析和概念级分析，ASAC使用对抗性反事实，TIBET通过变化身份相关词语进行偏见评估，BiasConnect构建因果图，InterMit提供模块化的偏见减少算法。

Result: 这些方法能够揭示偏见相关性、探索因果依赖关系，并帮助构建更健壮的系统。CAVLI显示了模型对无关线索的依赖，ASAC提高了模型的公平性和准确性，避免刻板印象。

Conclusion: 反事实推理作为一个统一的视角，在判别性和生成模型中实现了可解释性、公平性和因果性的结合，为社会责任偏见评估和减少提供了原则性、可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning -- the practice of asking ``what if'' by varying
inputs and observing changes in model behavior -- has become central to
interpretable and fair AI. This thesis develops frameworks that use
counterfactuals to explain, audit, and mitigate bias in vision classifiers and
generative models. By systematically altering semantically meaningful
attributes while holding others fixed, these methods uncover spurious
correlations, probe causal dependencies, and help build more robust systems.
  The first part addresses vision classifiers. CAVLI integrates attribution
(LIME) with concept-level analysis (TCAV) to quantify how strongly decisions
rely on human-interpretable concepts. With localized heatmaps and a Concept
Dependency Score, CAVLI shows when models depend on irrelevant cues like
backgrounds. Extending this, ASAC introduces adversarial counterfactuals that
perturb protected attributes while preserving semantics. Through curriculum
learning, ASAC fine-tunes biased models for improved fairness and accuracy
while avoiding stereotype-laden artifacts.
  The second part targets generative Text-to-Image (TTI) models. TIBET provides
a scalable pipeline for evaluating prompt-sensitive biases by varying
identity-related terms, enabling causal auditing of how race, gender, and age
affect image generation. To capture interactions, BiasConnect builds causal
graphs diagnosing intersectional biases. Finally, InterMit offers a modular,
training-free algorithm that mitigates intersectional bias via causal
sensitivity scores and user-defined fairness goals.
  Together, these contributions show counterfactuals as a unifying lens for
interpretability, fairness, and causality in both discriminative and generative
models, establishing principled, scalable methods for socially responsible bias
evaluation and mitigation.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle perception typically relies on modular pipelines that
decompose the task into detection, tracking, and prediction. While
interpretable, these pipelines suffer from error accumulation and limited
inter-task synergy. Unified perception has emerged as a promising paradigm that
integrates these sub-tasks within a shared architecture, potentially improving
robustness, contextual reasoning, and efficiency while retaining interpretable
outputs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of unified
perception, introducing a holistic and systemic taxonomy that categorizes
methods along task integration, tracking formulation, and representation flow.
We define three paradigms -Early, Late, and Full Unified Perception- and
systematically review existing methods, their architectures, training
strategies, datasets used, and open-source availability, while highlighting
future research directions. This work establishes the first comprehensive
framework for understanding and advancing unified perception, consolidates
fragmented efforts, and guides future research toward more robust,
generalizable, and interpretable perception.

Method: 提出Dino U-Net架构，使用冻结的DINOv3主干作为编码器，通过专门的适配器融合丰富的语义特征和低级空间细节，并设计了保真度感知投影模块(FAPM)来在降维过程中保持表示质量。

Conclusion: 利用通用基础模型的优越密集预训练特征，为提升医学图像分割精度提供了一种高效且参数有效的方法。

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale natural image datasets offer a
powerful paradigm for medical image segmentation. However, effectively
transferring their learned representations for precise clinical applications
remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Dino U-Net, a novel
encoder-decoder architecture designed to exploit the high-fidelity dense
features of the DINOv3 vision foundation model. Our architecture introduces an
encoder built upon a frozen DINOv3 backbone, which employs a specialized
adapter to fuse the model's rich semantic features with low-level spatial
details. To preserve the quality of these representations during dimensionality
reduction, we design a new fidelity-aware projection module (FAPM) that
effectively refines and projects the features for the decoder. We conducted
extensive experiments on seven diverse public medical image segmentation
datasets. Our results show that Dino U-Net achieves state-of-the-art
performance, consistently outperforming previous methods across various imaging
modalities. Our framework proves to be highly scalable, with segmentation
accuracy consistently improving as the backbone model size increases up to the
7-billion-parameter variant. The findings demonstrate that leveraging the
superior, dense-pretrained features from a general-purpose foundation model
provides a highly effective and parameter-efficient approach to advance the
accuracy of medical image segmentation. The code is available at

Abstract: Mitotic figures (MFs) are relevant biomarkers in tumor grading.
Differentiating atypical MFs (AMFs) from normal MFs (NMFs) remains difficult,
as manual annotation is time-consuming and subjective. In this work an ensemble

achieved a balanced accuracy of 84.02%. While the RBR increased specificity, it
reduced sensitivity and overall performance. The results show that deep
ensembles perform well for AMF classification. RBR can increase specific
metrics but requires further research.

Conclusion: 该融合管道实现了准确且可扩展的人体运动跟踪，非常适合工业和安全关键应用

Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, monitoring human activity is essential for
ensuring both ergonomic safety and overall well-being. While multi-camera
centralized setups improve pose estimation accuracy, they often suffer from
high computational costs and bandwidth requirements, limiting scalability and
real-time applicability. Distributing processing across edge devices can reduce
network bandwidth and computational load. On the other hand, the constrained
resources of edge devices lead to accuracy degradation, and the distribution of
computation leads to temporal and spatial inconsistencies. We address this
challenge by proposing COMETH (Convex Optimization for Multiview Estimation and
Tracking of Humans), a lightweight algorithm for real-time multi-view human
pose fusion that relies on three concepts: it integrates kinematic and
biomechanical constraints to increase the joint positioning accuracy; it
employs convex optimization-based inverse kinematics for spatial fusion; and it
implements a state observer to improve temporal consistency. We evaluate COMETH
on both public and industrial datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in localization, detection, and tracking accuracy. The proposed fusion
pipeline enables accurate and scalable human motion tracking, making it
well-suited for industrial and safety-critical applications. The code is

Abstract: Many high-performance networks were not designed with lightweight application
scenarios in mind from the outset, which has greatly restricted their scope of
application. This paper takes ConvNeXt as the research object and significantly
reduces the parameter scale and network complexity of ConvNeXt by integrating
the Cross Stage Partial Connections mechanism and a series of optimized
designs. The new network is named E-ConvNeXt, which can maintain high accuracy
performance under different complexity configurations. The three core
innovations of E-ConvNeXt are : (1) integrating the Cross Stage Partial Network
(CSPNet) with ConvNeXt and adjusting the network structure, which reduces the
model's network complexity by up to 80%; (2) Optimizing the Stem and Block
structures to enhance the model's feature expression capability and operational
efficiency; (3) Replacing Layer Scale with channel attention. Experimental
validation on ImageNet classification demonstrates E-ConvNeXt's superior
accuracy-efficiency balance: E-ConvNeXt-mini reaches 78.3% Top-1 accuracy at
0.9GFLOPs. E-ConvNeXt-small reaches 81.9% Top-1 accuracy at 3.1GFLOPs. Transfer

Abstract: We present DrivingGaussian++, an efficient and effective framework for
realistic reconstructing and controllable editing of surrounding dynamic

training-free controllable editing for dynamic driving scenes, including
texture modification, weather simulation, and object manipulation, leveraging
multi-view images and depth priors. By integrating large language models (LLMs)

Conclusion: 该研究通过创新的注释生成方法和数据集构建技术，有效解决了图像操纵定位领域的数据短缺问题，为该领域的研究提供了重要的数据支撑和新的研究方向

Abstract: Images manipulated using image editing tools can mislead viewers and pose
significant risks to social security. However, accurately localizing the
manipulated regions within an image remains a challenging problem. One of the
main barriers in this area is the high cost of data acquisition and the severe
lack of high-quality annotated datasets. To address this challenge, we
introduce novel methods that mitigate data scarcity by leveraging readily
available web data. We utilize a large collection of manually forged images
from the web, as well as automatically generated annotations derived from a
simpler auxiliary task, constrained image manipulation localization.
Specifically, we introduce a new paradigm CAAAv2, which automatically and
accurately annotates manipulated regions at the pixel level. To further improve
annotation quality, we propose a novel metric, QES, which filters out
unreliable annotations. Through CAAA v2 and QES, we construct MIMLv2, a
large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset containing 246,212 manually
forged images with pixel-level mask annotations. This is over 120x larger than
existing handcrafted datasets like IMD20. Additionally, we introduce Object
Jitter, a technique that further enhances model training by generating
high-quality manipulation artifacts. Building on these advances, we develop a
new model, Web-IML, designed to effectively leverage web-scale supervision for
the image manipulation localization task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach substantially alleviates the data scarcity problem and
significantly improves the performance of various models on multiple real-world
forgery benchmarks. With the proposed web supervision, Web-IML achieves a
striking performance gain of 31% and surpasses previous SOTA TruFor by 24.1
average IoU points. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at

Motivation: 现有视频加速方法存在根本局限性：既不建模视频帧的时间连贯性，也无法为大规模视频模型提供单步蒸馏，导致采样效率低下。

Method: 采用两阶段蒸馏过程：1）稳定性预热机制稳定对抗蒸馏；2）统一对抗平衡机制在高斯噪声空间中进行稳定的单步对抗训练。对于条件生成还提出了条件对抗一致性方法。

Conclusion: POSE成功解决了大规模视频扩散模型的采样效率瓶颈，实现了高质量单步视频生成，在保持竞争力的同时显著降低了计算延迟。

Abstract: The field of video diffusion generation faces critical bottlenecks in
sampling efficiency, especially for large-scale models and long sequences.
Existing video acceleration methods adopt image-based techniques but suffer
from fundamental limitations: they neither model the temporal coherence of
video frames nor provide single-step distillation for large-scale video models.
To bridge this gap, we propose POSE (Phased One-Step Equilibrium), a
distillation framework that reduces the sampling steps of large-scale video
diffusion models, enabling the generation of high-quality videos in a single
step. POSE employs a carefully designed two-phase process to distill video
models:(i) stability priming: a warm-up mechanism to stabilize adversarial
distillation that adapts the high-quality trajectory of the one-step generator
from high to low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, optimizing the video quality of
single-step mappings near the endpoints of flow trajectories. (ii) unified
adversarial equilibrium: a flexible self-adversarial distillation mechanism
that promotes stable single-step adversarial training towards a Nash
equilibrium within the Gaussian noise space, generating realistic single-step
videos close to real videos. For conditional video generation, we propose (iii)
conditional adversarial consistency, a method to improve both semantic
consistency and frame consistency between conditional frames and generated
frames. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that POSE outperforms other
acceleration methods on VBench-I2V by average 7.15% in semantic alignment,
temporal conference and frame quality, reducing the latency of the pre-trained
model by 100$\times$, from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds, while maintaining
competitive performance.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models enable high-quality image generation but are
computationally expensive. While prior work optimizes per-inference efficiency,
we explore an orthogonal approach: reducing redundancy across correlated
prompts. Our method leverages the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion models,
where early denoising steps capture shared structures among similar prompts. We
propose a training-free approach that clusters prompts based on semantic
similarity and shares computation in early diffusion steps. Experiments show
that for models trained conditioned on image embeddings, our approach
significantly reduces compute cost while improving image quality. By leveraging
UnClip's text-to-image prior, we enhance diffusion step allocation for greater
efficiency. Our method seamlessly integrates with existing pipelines, scales
with prompt sets, and reduces the environmental and financial burden of
large-scale text-to-image generation. Project page:

Motivation: 标记手写数据稀缺限制了识别系统的效果，现有合成方法存在两个主要问题：传统卷积架构难以建模长距离依赖和复杂笔画模式，以及忽视频率信息对捕捉细粒度风格细节的关键作用。

Method: 提出FW-GAN框架，包含相位感知Wave-MLP生成器来捕捉空间关系并保留风格线索，频率引导判别器利用高频成分增强真实性检测，以及新颖的频率分布损失来对齐合成与真实手写的频率特征。

Result: 在越南语和英语手写数据集上的实验表明，FW-GAN能够生成高质量、风格一致的手写体，有效增强低资源手写识别流程的数据。

Conclusion: FW-GAN通过充分利用频率信息，显著提升了手写体合成的真实性和风格一致性，为低资源手写识别提供了有价值的数据增强工具。

Abstract: Labeled handwriting data is often scarce, limiting the effectiveness of
recognition systems that require diverse, style-consistent training samples.
Handwriting synthesis offers a promising solution by generating artificial data
to augment training. However, current methods face two major limitations.
First, most are built on conventional convolutional architectures, which
struggle to model long-range dependencies and complex stroke patterns. Second,
they largely ignore the crucial role of frequency information, which is
essential for capturing fine-grained stylistic and structural details in
handwriting. To address these challenges, we propose FW-GAN, a one-shot
handwriting synthesis framework that generates realistic, writer-consistent
text from a single example. Our generator integrates a phase-aware Wave-MLP to
better capture spatial relationships while preserving subtle stylistic cues. We
further introduce a frequency-guided discriminator that leverages
high-frequency components to enhance the authenticity detection of generated
samples. Additionally, we introduce a novel Frequency Distribution Loss that
aligns the frequency characteristics of synthetic and real handwriting, thereby
enhancing visual fidelity. Experiments on Vietnamese and English handwriting
datasets demonstrate that FW-GAN generates high-quality, style-consistent
handwriting, making it a valuable tool for augmenting data in low-resource
handwriting recognition (HTR) pipelines. Official implementation is available

*Junpeng Ma,Qizhe Zhang,Ming Lu,Zhibin Wang,Qiang Zhou,Jun Song,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMG-Vid是一个无需训练的视觉token剪枝框架，通过最大化边际增益在段级和token级去除冗余，显著减少75%视觉token同时保持99.5%性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频大语言模型的视觉token过多导致计算效率低下，现有方法未考虑视频的动态特性和时间依赖性

Method: 提出两阶段方法：1)基于帧相似性分割视频并动态分配token预算；2)使用时序引导的DPC算法联合建模帧间独特性和帧内多样性

Result: 在LLaVA-OneVision-7B上减少75%视觉token，预填充阶段加速3.9倍，保持99.5%原始性能

Conclusion: MMG-Vid能最大化有限token预算的利用率，在显著提升效率的同时保持强大性能

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) excel in video understanding, but their
excessive visual tokens pose a significant computational challenge for
real-world applications. Current methods aim to enhance inference efficiency by
visual token pruning. However, they do not consider the dynamic characteristics
and temporal dependencies of video frames, as they perceive video understanding
as a multi-frame task. To address these challenges, we propose MMG-Vid, a novel
training-free visual token pruning framework that removes redundancy by
Maximizing Marginal Gains at both segment-level and token-level. Specifically,
we first divide the video into segments based on frame similarity, and then
dynamically allocate the token budget for each segment to maximize the marginal
gain of each segment. Subsequently, we propose a temporal-guided DPC algorithm
that jointly models inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity, thereby
maximizing the marginal gain of each token. By combining both stages, MMG-Vid
can maximize the utilization of the limited token budget, significantly
improving efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MMG-Vid can maintain over 99.5% of the original
performance, while effectively reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating the
prefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B. Code will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CogVLA是一个认知对齐的视觉-语言-动作框架，通过指令驱动路由和稀疏化技术，在提高效率的同时提升性能，相比OpenVLA减少2.5倍训练成本和2.8倍推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型需要大量后训练，计算开销大，限制了可扩展性和部署。需要一种更高效的框架来减少计算负担。

Method: 采用3阶段渐进架构：1) EFA-Routing将指令信息注入视觉编码器，选择性聚合压缩视觉token；2) LFP-Routing引入动作意图，剪枝指令无关的视觉token实现token级稀疏；3) V-L-A耦合注意力结合因果视觉语言注意力和双向动作并行解码。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试和真实机器人任务中分别达到97.4%和70.0%的成功率，实现最先进性能，同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: CogVLA通过认知对齐的设计，在保持高性能的同时大幅提升了效率，为视觉-语言-动作模型的部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built on pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) require extensive post-training, resulting in
high computational overhead that limits scalability and deployment.We propose
CogVLA, a Cognition-Aligned Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages
instruction-driven routing and sparsification to improve both efficiency and
performance. CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and
introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based
Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the
vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens,
forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this
compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing)
introduces action intent into the language model by pruning
instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level
sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support
accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention
(CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional
action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and
real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art
performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing
training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold
compared to OpenVLA. CogVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at

TL;DR: 首个数据驱动的多视角3D点跟踪器，使用4台摄像机即可进行精确的3D跟踪，充分利用多视角特征解决单目跟踪的深度歧义和遮挡问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单目跟踪器存在深度歧义和遮挡问题，而传统多摄像机方法需要20台以上摄像机且需每个序列优化，故需要一种更实用的多视角3D跟踪方案

Method: 使用已知摄像机姿态和深度信息，将多视角特征融合成统一点云，采用k近邻相关和基于transformer的更新机制来估计长程3D对应关系

Result: 在Panoptic Studio和DexYCB两个真实数据集上评测，达到中位轨迹误差分别为3.1cm和2.0cm，能够良好地泛化到1-8个视角的多种摄像机配置

Conclusion: 该方法为多视角3D跟踪研究设置了新标准，提供了一种实用的工具，并开源了跟踪器和数据集以促进领域发展

Abstract: We introduce the first data-driven multi-view 3D point tracker, designed to
track arbitrary points in dynamic scenes using multiple camera views. Unlike
existing monocular trackers, which struggle with depth ambiguities and
occlusion, or prior multi-camera methods that require over 20 cameras and
tedious per-sequence optimization, our feed-forward model directly predicts 3D
correspondences using a practical number of cameras (e.g., four), enabling
robust and accurate online tracking. Given known camera poses and either
sensor-based or estimated multi-view depth, our tracker fuses multi-view
features into a unified point cloud and applies k-nearest-neighbors correlation
alongside a transformer-based update to reliably estimate long-range 3D
correspondences, even under occlusion. We train on 5K synthetic multi-view
Kubric sequences and evaluate on two real-world benchmarks: Panoptic Studio and
DexYCB, achieving median trajectory errors of 3.1 cm and 2.0 cm, respectively.
Our method generalizes well to diverse camera setups of 1-8 views with varying
vantage points and video lengths of 24-150 frames. By releasing our tracker
alongside training and evaluation datasets, we aim to set a new standard for
multi-view 3D tracking research and provide a practical tool for real-world
applications. Project page available at https://ethz-vlg.github.io/mvtracker.

TL;DR: OneReward是一个统一的强化学习框架，使用单一奖励模型提升多任务生成能力，在图像编辑任务中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多任务生成方法通常需要针对特定任务进行监督微调，限制了泛化能力和训练效率，需要一种统一的奖励框架来解决这个问题

Method: 使用单一视觉语言模型作为生成奖励模型，能够区分不同任务和评估标准下的优劣结果，基于此开发了Seedream 3.0 Fill模型，通过多任务强化学习直接在预训练基础模型上训练

Result: 实验结果表明，该统一编辑模型在多个评估维度上一致优于商业和开源竞争对手，如Ideogram、Adobe Photoshop和FLUX Fill [Pro]

Conclusion: OneReward框架证明了使用单一奖励模型可以有效提升多任务生成能力，无需任务特定的监督微调，在图像编辑领域取得了优异性能

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OneReward, a unified reinforcement learning
framework that enhances the model's generative capabilities across multiple
tasks under different evaluation criteria using only \textit{One Reward} model.
By employing a single vision-language model (VLM) as the generative reward
model, which can distinguish the winner and loser for a given task and a given
evaluation criterion, it can be effectively applied to multi-task generation
models, particularly in contexts with varied data and diverse task objectives.
We utilize OneReward for mask-guided image generation, which can be further
divided into several sub-tasks such as image fill, image extend, object
removal, and text rendering, involving a binary mask as the edit area. Although
these domain-specific tasks share same conditioning paradigm, they differ
significantly in underlying data distributions and evaluation metrics. Existing
methods often rely on task-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which limits
generalization and training efficiency. Building on OneReward, we develop
Seedream 3.0 Fill, a mask-guided generation model trained via multi-task
reinforcement learning directly on a pre-trained base model, eliminating the
need for task-specific SFT. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified
edit model consistently outperforms both commercial and open-source
competitors, such as Ideogram, Adobe Photoshop, and FLUX Fill [Pro], across
multiple evaluation dimensions. Code and model are available at:

quality 5-second-long 24 FPS virtual try-on videos at 1152x720 resolution of a
user wearing desired garments while moving in accordance with a given reference
video. Our approach requires a single user image and supports a range of tops,
bottoms, and one-piece garments, as well as simultaneous tops and bottoms
try-on in a single pass. Key to our framework is CondNet, a novel conditioning
network that leverages attention to unify multi-modal inputs (text, images, and

trained on heterogeneous training data, combining limited video data and a
larger, more readily available image dataset, in a multistage progressive
manner. Dress&Dance outperforms existing open source and commercial solutions

*Fahad Shamshad,Tameem Bakr,Yahia Shaaban,Noor Hussein,Karthik Nandakumar,Nils Lukas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对NeurIPS 2024隐式水印擦除挑战的获胜解决方案，包含黑盒和白盒两种攻击方法，实现了95.7%的水印去除率且保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数字水印技术在面对对抗攻击时的鲁棒性不明确，需要通过挑战赛来测试水印在各种对抗条件下的稳健性。

Method: 白盒攻击采用自适应VAE规避攻击，结合测试时优化和CIELAB空间的颜色对比度恢复；黑盒攻击先基于空间或频域伪影聚类图像，然后对每个聚类应用图像到图像扩散模型，结合受控噪声注入和ChatGPT生成的语义先验。

Result: 实证评估显示该方法成功实现了近乎完美的水印去除（95.7%），对剩余图像质量影响可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 这些攻击方法有望激发更鲁棒的图像水印技术的发展。

Abstract: Content watermarking is an important tool for the authentication and
copyright protection of digital media. However, it is unclear whether existing
watermarks are robust against adversarial attacks. We present the winning
solution to the NeurIPS 2024 Erasing the Invisible challenge, which
stress-tests watermark robustness under varying degrees of adversary knowledge.
The challenge consisted of two tracks: a black-box and beige-box track,
depending on whether the adversary knows which watermarking method was used by
the provider. For the beige-box track, we leverage an adaptive VAE-based
evasion attack, with a test-time optimization and color-contrast restoration in
CIELAB space to preserve the image's quality. For the black-box track, we first
cluster images based on their artifacts in the spatial or frequency-domain.
Then, we apply image-to-image diffusion models with controlled noise injection
and semantic priors from ChatGPT-generated captions to each cluster with
optimized parameter settings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method
successfully achieves near-perfect watermark removal (95.7%) with negligible
impact on the residual image's quality. We hope that our attacks inspire the
development of more robust image watermarking methods.

Abstract: Pretrained multilingual models exhibit the same social bias as models
processing English texts. This systematic review analyzes emerging research
that extends bias evaluation and mitigation approaches into multilingual and
non-English contexts. We examine these studies with respect to linguistic
diversity, cultural awareness, and their choice of evaluation metrics and
mitigation techniques. Our survey illuminates gaps in the field's dominant
methodological design choices (e.g., preference for certain languages, scarcity
of multilingual mitigation experiments) while cataloging common issues
encountered and solutions implemented in adapting bias benchmarks across
languages and cultures. Drawing from the implications of our findings, we chart
directions for future research that can reinforce the multilingual bias
literature's inclusivity, cross-cultural appropriateness, and alignment with
state-of-the-art NLP advancements.

Motivation: 降低人工测试开发成本和不一致性，探索在有限数据条件下使用语言模型自动生成高质量评估项目的可行性。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1) 比较微调的中等模型(Gemma, 2B)与未调优的大模型(GPT-3.5, 175B)；2) 评估七种结构化提示策略，包括零样本、少样本、思维链、基于角色、顺序设计及其组合。使用自动化指标和专家评分进行评估，并利用GPT-4.1模拟大规模人工评分。

Result: 结构化提示策略（特别是思维链与顺序设计组合）显著提升了Gemma的输出质量。Gemma生成的项目比GPT-3.5的零样本响应更具结构一致性和教学适宜性，提示设计对中等规模模型性能起关键作用。

Conclusion: 结构化提示和高效微调可以增强中等规模模型在有限数据条件下的自动生成能力。结合自动化指标、专家判断和大模型模拟的方法能确保评估目标的一致性，为K-12语言评估项目开发提供实用且可扩展的工作流程。

Abstract: This study explores automatic generation (AIG) using language models to
create multiple choice questions (MCQs) for morphological assessment, aiming to
reduce the cost and inconsistency of manual test development. The study used a
two-fold approach. First, we compared a fine-tuned medium model (Gemma, 2B)
with a larger untuned one (GPT-3.5, 175B). Second, we evaluated seven
structured prompting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot,
chain-of-thought, role-based, sequential, and combinations. Generated items
were assessed using automated metrics and expert scoring across five
dimensions. We also used GPT-4.1, trained on expert-rated samples, to simulate
human scoring at scale. Results show that structured prompting, especially
strategies combining chain-of-thought and sequential design, significantly
improved Gemma's outputs. Gemma generally produced more construct-aligned and
instructionally appropriate items than GPT-3.5's zero-shot responses, with
prompt design playing a key role in mid-size model performance. This study
demonstrates that structured prompting and efficient fine-tuning can enhance
midsized models for AIG under limited data conditions. We highlight the value
of combining automated metrics, expert judgment, and large-model simulation to
ensure alignment with assessment goals. The proposed workflow offers a
practical and scalable way to develop and validate language assessment items
for K-12.

Abstract: The growing complexity of cyber-physical systems, particularly in automotive
applications, has increased the demand for efficient modeling and cross-domain
co-simulation techniques. While SystemC Transaction-Level Modeling (TLM)
enables effective hardware/software co-design, its limited interoperability

By encapsulating SystemC TLM components as FMI 3.0 Co Simulation Functional
Mock-up Units (FMUs), the proposed approach facilitates seamless, standardized

lightweight open-source toolchain, address key technical challenges such as
time synchronization and data exchange, and demonstrate the feasibility and
effectiveness of the integration through representative case studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 紧凑语言模型（如0.5B参数）由于推理能力差，在强化学习训练中面临奖励稀疏和训练不稳定的问题，难以实现代理式RAG行为。

Method: 提出蒸馏引导策略优化（DGPO），包括从教师演示进行冷启动初始化，以及在策略优化过程中提供持续的教师指导。

Result: DGPO使紧凑模型能够实现复杂的代理搜索行为，在某些情况下甚至超越了更大的教师模型，使代理式RAG在计算资源受限环境中变得可行。

Conclusion: DGPO方法有效解决了小模型在强化学习训练中的困难，通过系统性的教师指导机制，成功实现了紧凑模型的代理式RAG能力提升。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a post-training approach to elicit
agentic RAG behaviors such as search and planning from language models.
However, compact language models (e.g., 0.5B parameters) struggle due to poor
reasoning ability, resulting in sparse rewards and unstable training. To
overcome these difficulties, we propose Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization
(DGPO), which addresses the challenges through cold-start initialization from
teacher demonstrations and continuous teacher guidance during policy
optimization. To systematically evaluate our approach, we introduce Agentic RAG
Capabilities (ARC), a fine-grained metric analyzing reasoning, search
coordination, and response synthesis. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that DGPO enables compact models to achieve sophisticated agentic search
behaviors, even outperforming the larger teacher model in some cases. DGPO
makes agentic RAG feasible in computing resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GUARD是一种将政府AI伦理指南转化为可操作测试问题的方法，通过自动生成违反指南的问题来评估大语言模型的合规性，并包含越狱诊断功能来识别潜在安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在各领域的广泛应用，其可能生成有害内容的风险引发了社会关注。政府发布的伦理指南多为高层级要求，缺乏具体可操作的测试方法，需要将其转化为实际的测试问题来验证模型合规性。

Method: GUARD方法通过自动生成违反政府指南的问题来测试LLM响应，对于不直接违反指南的响应，引入GUARD-JD越狱诊断功能，创建可能引发不道德或违规响应的场景，识别可能绕过内置安全机制的情况。

Result: 在7个LLM上实证验证了GUARD的有效性，包括Vicuna-13B、LongChat-7B、Llama2-7B等模型，测试了三个政府指南的合规性并进行了越狱诊断。GUARD-JD还可迁移到视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: GUARD提供了一种系统化的方法来将高层级伦理指南转化为具体测试，能够有效评估LLM的合规性并识别潜在安全漏洞，有助于促进可靠的LLM应用开发。

Abstract: As Large Language Models become increasingly integral to various domains,
their potential to generate harmful responses has prompted significant societal
and regulatory concerns. In response, governments have issued ethics guidelines
to promote the development of trustworthy AI. However, these guidelines are
typically high-level demands for developers and testers, leaving a gap in
translating them into actionable testing questions to verify LLM compliance.
  To address this challenge, we introduce GUARD (\textbf{G}uideline
\textbf{U}pholding Test through \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}ole-play and
Jailbreak \textbf{D}iagnostics), a testing method designed to operationalize
guidelines into specific guideline-violating questions that assess LLM
adherence. To implement this, GUARD uses automated generation of
guideline-violating questions based on government-issued guidelines, thereby
testing whether responses comply with these guidelines. When responses directly
violate guidelines, GUARD reports inconsistencies. Furthermore, for responses
that do not directly violate guidelines, GUARD integrates the concept of
``jailbreaks'' to diagnostics, named GUARD-JD, which creates scenarios that
provoke unethical or guideline-violating responses, effectively identifying
potential scenarios that could bypass built-in safety mechanisms. Our method
finally culminates in a compliance report, delineating the extent of adherence
and highlighting any violations.
  We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on seven LLMs,
including Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4,
GPT-4o, and Claude-3.7, by testing compliance under three government-issued
guidelines and conducting jailbreak diagnostics. Additionally, GUARD-JD can
transfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models, demonstrating its
usage in promoting reliable LLM-based applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在处理长上下文时存在内存限制和复杂推理困难的问题，同时缺乏透明度且容易产生幻觉，需要新的解决方案来提升长文本理解能力。

Method: JERR框架包含三个关键组件：1）策略性分块提取摘要；2）构建有向无环图解决冗余问题；3）集成蒙特卡洛树搜索来导航复杂推理路径。

Result: 实验结果表明JERR在ROUGE和F1指标上 consistently outperforms所有基线方法，在LLM-Rater评估中获得最高分数。

Conclusion: JERR为大语言模型处理扩展上下文和复杂推理任务提供了新颖的解决方案，显著提升了可靠性和透明度。

Abstract: Despite significant progress, large language models (LLMs) still struggle
with long contexts due to memory limitations and their inability to tackle
complex and long-context tasks. Additionally, LLMs often suffer from a lack of
transparency and are prone to producing hallucinations. To address these
challenges, we propose \textbf{JERR}, a novel framework designed to enhance
long-context comprehension via graph-based reasoning in LLMs. JERR integrates
three key components: synopsis extraction, graph construction, and relational
reasoning. First, synopsis is extracted by chunking text strategically,
allowing the model to summarize and understand information more efficiently.
Second, we build a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to resolve redundancy, ensuring
logical consistency and clarity. Finally, we incorporate Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to help the model navigate complex reasoning paths, ensuring more
accurate and interpretable outputs. This framework provides a novel solution
that enables LLMs to handle extended contexts and complex reasoning tasks with
improved reliability and transparency. Experimental results show that JERR
consistently outperforms all baselines on the ROUGE and F1 metrics, achieving
the highest scores on the LLM-Rater evaluation.

Method: 两阶段后训练框架：1）在拒绝采样的NP难图问题上进行长链推理监督微调（SFT）；2）使用细粒度奖励设计的强化学习（RL）来提升推理效率。

Result: 旗舰模型Graph-R1-7B在数学、编程、STEM和逻辑任务上表现出强大的泛化能力，在NP难图问题上准确率和推理效率均超越QwQ-32B模型。

Conclusion: NP难图问题为LLM长链推理后训练提供了有效且可扩展的新资源，开辟了LLM后训练的新前沿。

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress on complex reasoning tasks, largely enabled by their long
chain-of-thought (Long CoT) capabilities. However, developing these Long CoT
behaviors relies heavily on post-training with high-quality datasets, which are
typically costly and human-curated (e.g., mathematics and code), leaving
scalable alternatives unexplored. In this work, we introduce NP-hard (NPH)
graph problems as a novel synthetic training corpus, as they inherently require
deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and reflective strategies, which are
core characteristics of Long CoT reasoning. Building on this insight, we
develop a two-stage post-training framework: (i) Long CoT Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on rejection-sampled NPH graph instances, which substantially
enhances reasoning depth, and (ii) Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a
fine-grained reward design, which sharpens reasoning efficiency. Our flagship
model, Graph-R1-7B, demonstrates strong generalization across mathematics,
coding, STEM, and logic, and surpasses QwQ-32B on NPH graph problems in both
accuracy and reasoning efficiency. These results position NPH graph problems as
an effective and scalable resource for advancing Long CoT reasoning in LLMs,
opening a new frontier for LLM post-training. Our implementation is available

in our Hugging Face collection HKUST-DSAIL/Graph-R1.

### [107] [CAPE: Context-Aware Personality Evaluation Framework for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20385)
*Jivnesh Sandhan,Fei Cheng,Tushar Sandhan,Yugo Murawaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个上下文感知的人格评估框架CAPE，通过引入对话历史来评估LLM的行为特质，发现对话历史能提高响应一致性但也会导致人格偏移，不同模型对上下文敏感度差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心理测量测试对LLM采用无上下文方法，忽略了真实应用中对话历史对响应的影响，需要开发上下文感知的评估框架。

Method: 提出CAPE框架，引入对话历史和心理测量问题，设计新指标量化LLM响应一致性，在7个LLM上进行实验分析。

Result: 对话历史通过上下文学习提高响应一致性，但会导致人格偏移；GPT模型对问题顺序稳健，Gemini和Llama敏感；GPT响应源于内在人格特质和先前交互，而Gemini和Llama严重依赖先前交互。

Conclusion: 上下文依赖的人格偏移能提高角色扮演代理的响应一致性并更好符合人类判断，证明了上下文感知评估的重要性。

Abstract: Psychometric tests, traditionally used to assess humans, are now being
applied to Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate their behavioral traits.
However, existing studies follow a context-free approach, answering each
question in isolation to avoid contextual influence. We term this the Disney
World test, an artificial setting that ignores real-world applications, where
conversational history shapes responses. To bridge this gap, we propose the
first Context-Aware Personality Evaluation (CAPE) framework for LLMs,
incorporating prior conversational interactions. To thoroughly analyze the
influence of context, we introduce novel metrics to quantify the consistency of
LLM responses, a fundamental trait in human behavior.
  Our exhaustive experiments on 7 LLMs reveal that conversational history
enhances response consistency via in-context learning but also induces
personality shifts, with GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo exhibiting extreme
deviations. While GPT models are robust to question ordering, Gemini-1.5-Flash
and Llama-8B display significant sensitivity. Moreover, GPT models response
stem from their intrinsic personality traits as well as prior interactions,
whereas Gemini-1.5-Flash and Llama--8B heavily depend on prior interactions.
Finally, applying our framework to Role Playing Agents (RPAs) shows
context-dependent personality shifts improve response consistency and better
align with human judgments. Our code and datasets are publicly available at:

*Xu Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过分析语言模型的条件熱向来研究推理步骤对最终答案正确性的贡献，发现熱向逐步下降与正确答案强相关，而错误推理路径通常更长且无效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然现有研究多重视生成中间推理步骤来提高准确性，但很少研究考察这些推理步骤对最终答案的实际贡献。由于自回归生成的随机性，生成更多上下文并不保证能提高答案的信心度。

Method: 在MATH数据集上使用Qwen2.5-32B和GPT-4o生成推理链，然后使用Qwen3-8B模型量化这些推理链对最终准确性的贡献。通过条件熱向（预期负对数概率）来测量模型在每个推理步骤对答案范围Y的不确定性。

Result: 结果显示明显模式：条件熱向逐步下降与正确答案强相关，而平坦或上升的熱向通常导致错误答案。同时证实错误推理路径通常比正确推理更长，说明更长的推理并不肯定带来更好的结果。

Conclusion: 这些发现为设计高效的推理流水线奠定了基础，能够早期检测和避免无效推理，从而提高语言模型的推理效率和准确性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) often rely on generating
intermediate reasoning steps to enhance accuracy. However, little work has
examined how reasoning utility contributes to the final answer's correctness.
Due to the stochastic nature of autoregressive generation, generating more
context does not guarantee increased confidence in the answer. If we could
predict, during generation, whether a reasoning step will be useful, we could
stop early or prune ineffective steps, avoiding distractions in the final
decision.
  We present an oracle study on MATH dataset, using Qwen2.5-32B and GPT-4o to
generate reasoning chains, and then employing a separate model (Qwen3-8B) to
quantify the utility of these chains for final accuracy. Specifically, we
measure the model's uncertainty on the answer span Y at each reasoning step
using conditional entropy (expected negative log-likelihood over the
vocabulary) with context expanding step by step. Our results show a clear
pattern: conditional entropy that decreases over steps is strongly associated
with correct answers, whereas flat or increasing entropy often results in wrong
answers. We also corroborate that incorrect reasoning paths tend to be longer
than correct ones, suggesting that longer reasoning does not necessarily yield
better outcomes. These findings serve as a foundation to inspire future work on
designing efficient reasoning pipelines that detect and avoid unproductive
reasoning early.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型和医疗大语言模型在通用医疗基准上表现良好，但在需要深度专业知识的牙科等专科领域能力尚未充分探索，缺乏针对性评估资源。

Method: 构建DentalBench基准：1）DentalQA：36,597个中英文问答问题，涵盖4个任务和16个牙科子领域；2）DentalCorpus：3.37亿token的大规模高质量牙科语料库，支持监督微调和检索增强生成。评估了14个LLM，并进行领域适应实验。

Result: 评估显示不同模型在任务类型和语言上存在显著性能差距。使用Qwen-2.5-3B的实验表明，领域适应能大幅提升模型性能，特别是在知识密集和术语集中的任务上。

Conclusion: 领域特定基准测试对于开发可信赖且有效的医疗应用LLM至关重要，牙科领域的专业化评估和适应能显著改善模型在专科医疗场景中的表现。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and medical LLMs (Med-LLMs)
have demonstrated strong performance on general medical benchmarks. However,
their capabilities in specialized medical fields, such as dentistry which
require deeper domain-specific knowledge, remain underexplored due to the lack
of targeted evaluation resources. In this paper, we introduce DentalBench, the
first comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to evaluate and advance LLMs
in the dental domain. DentalBench consists of two main components: DentalQA, an
English-Chinese question-answering (QA) benchmark with 36,597 questions
spanning 4 tasks and 16 dental subfields; and DentalCorpus, a large-scale,
high-quality corpus with 337.35 million tokens curated for dental domain
adaptation, supporting both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We evaluate 14 LLMs, covering
proprietary, open-source, and medical-specific models, and reveal significant
performance gaps across task types and languages. Further experiments with
Qwen-2.5-3B demonstrate that domain adaptation substantially improves model
performance, particularly on knowledge-intensive and terminology-focused tasks,
and highlight the importance of domain-specific benchmarks for developing
trustworthy and effective LLMs tailored to healthcare applications.

TL;DR: KG-CQR是一个基于知识图谱的上下文查询检索框架，通过提取和补全相关KG子图来增强复杂查询的语义表示，在RAG系统中显著提升检索性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG系统主要解决语料库级别的上下文丢失问题，但缺乏对复杂查询的语义丰富表示。知识图谱与LLMs的结合有潜力通过结构化关系表示来改进检索阶段的查询表示

Method: 提出KG-CQR框架，包含子图提取、子图补全和上下文生成三个模块。通过提取和补全相关KG子图来生成语义丰富的查询上下文，作为模型无关的管道工作

Result: 在RAGBench和MultiHop-RAG数据集上，mAP提升4-6%，Recall@25提升2-3%。在多跳问答等挑战性RAG任务中，检索效果持续优于现有基线

Conclusion: KG-CQR通过知识图谱增强查询表示，有效提升了RAG系统的检索性能，具有模型无关性和可扩展性优势

Abstract: The integration of knowledge graphs (KGs) with large language models (LLMs)
offers significant potential to improve the retrieval phase of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. In this study, we propose KG-CQR,
a novel framework for Contextual Query Retrieval (CQR) that enhances the
retrieval phase by enriching the contextual representation of complex input
queries using a corpus-centric KG. Unlike existing methods that primarily
address corpus-level context loss, KG-CQR focuses on query enrichment through
structured relation representations, extracting and completing relevant KG
subgraphs to generate semantically rich query contexts. Comprising subgraph
extraction, completion, and contextual generation modules, KG-CQR operates as a
model-agnostic pipeline, ensuring scalability across LLMs of varying sizes
without additional training. Experimental results on RAGBench and MultiHop-RAG
datasets demonstrate KG-CQR's superior performance, achieving a 4-6%
improvement in mAP and a 2-3% improvement in Recall@25 over strong baseline
models. Furthermore, evaluations on challenging RAG tasks such as multi-hop
question answering show that, by incorporating KG-CQR, the performance
consistently outperforms the existing baseline in terms of retrieval
effectiveness

Motivation: 民航维修领域缺乏专门的大语言模型评估工具，该领域具有严格的行业标准和知识密集型特点，需要复杂的推理能力。

Method: 开发了一个工业级基准测试，包含标准化评估工具，用于测量LLM在民航维修领域的能力，并利用该基准评估现有的向量嵌入模型和LLM。

Conclusion: 该工作填补了当前LLM评估的重要空白，为民航维修领域提供了专门的评估工具，有助于推动该领域智能化解决方案的发展。

Abstract: Civil aviation maintenance is a domain characterized by stringent industry
standards. Within this field, maintenance procedures and troubleshooting
represent critical, knowledge-intensive tasks that require sophisticated
reasoning. To address the lack of specialized evaluation tools for large
language models (LLMs) in this vertical, we propose and develop an
industrial-grade benchmark specifically designed for civil aviation
maintenance. This benchmark serves a dual purpose: It provides a standardized
tool to measure LLM capabilities within civil aviation maintenance, identifying
specific gaps in domain knowledge and complex reasoning. By pinpointing these
deficiencies, the benchmark establishes a foundation for targeted improvement
efforts (e.g., domain-specific fine-tuning, RAG optimization, or specialized
prompt engineering), ultimately facilitating progress toward more intelligent
solutions within civil aviation maintenance. Our work addresses a significant
gap in the current LLM evaluation, which primarily focuses on mathematical and
coding reasoning tasks. In addition, given that Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems are currently the dominant solutions in practical applications ,
we leverage this benchmark to evaluate existing well-known vector embedding
models and LLMs for civil aviation maintenance scenarios. Through experimental
exploration and analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark in
assessing model performance within this domain, and we open-source this
evaluation benchmark and code to foster further research and
development:https://github.com/CamBenchmark/cambenchmark

Motivation: 为了解决实践工作标题搜索问题，利用历史案例经验来寻找最相似的工作标题，提高搜索效率和准确性

Method: 使用案例推理(CBR)方法，结合TF-IDF进行文本向量化处理，采用余弦相似度计算标题间的相似度值

Result: 在705个实践工作标题的测试中，系统能够准确搜索标题和关键词，第二阶段测试获得相同数量的匹配标题和最高平均匹配分数

Conclusion: 该系统能够有效搜索实践工作标题，TF-IDF和余弦相似度的组合在标题匹配任务中表现良好

Abstract: Case Base Reasoning (CBR) is a case solving technique based on experience in
cases that have occurred before with the highest similarity. CBR is used to
search for practical work titles. TF-IDF is applied to process the
vectorization of each practical work title word and Cosine Similarity for the
calculation of similarity values. This system can search either in the form of
titles or keywords. The output of the system is the title of practical work and
the match value of each title. Based on the test results using 705 practical
work titles, testing was carried out with five titles and carried out in two
stages. The first stage searches with existing titles and the second stage
randomizes the title from the first stage. And the results obtained in the
second stage are the same number of titles found and the highest average match
score.

Abstract: We introduce MCP-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models
(LLMs) on realistic, multi-step tasks that demand tool use, cross-tool
coordination, precise parameter control, and planning/reasoning for solving
tasks. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), MCP-Bench connects LLMs to 28
representative live MCP servers spanning 250 tools across domains such as
finance, traveling, scientific computing, and academic search. Unlike prior
API-based benchmarks, each MCP server provides a set of complementary tools
designed to work together, enabling the construction of authentic, multi-step
tasks with rich input-output coupling. Tasks in MCP-Bench test agents' ability
to retrieve relevant tools from fuzzy instructions without explicit tool names,
plan multi-hop execution trajectories for complex objectives, ground responses
in intermediate tool outputs, and orchestrate cross-domain workflows -
capabilities not adequately evaluated by existing benchmarks that rely on
explicit tool specifications, shallow few-step workflows, and isolated domain
operations. We propose a multi-faceted evaluation framework covering tool-level
schema understanding and usage, trajectory-level planning, and task completion.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习和自然语言处理的多模态电子健康记录分析框架，用于预测ICU患者的死亡率和资源利用情况，在多个临床任务中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的电子健康记录分析方法主要关注结构化数据，忽略了自由文本笔记中的宝贵临床洞察，且未充分利用结构化数据中的文本信息潜力。

Method: 使用两个真实世界EHR数据集，开发了包含医学提示、自由文本和预训练句子编码器三个关键组件的深度学习框架，并通过消融实验验证各组件的重要性。

Result: 在三个临床任务中，模型性能显著提升：死亡率预测BACC/AUROC提高1.6%/0.8%，住院时长预测RMSE/MAE降低0.5%/2.2%，手术时长估计RMSE/MAE降低10.9%/11.0%，且在不同数据损坏率下均表现稳定。

Conclusion: 该框架是预测重症监护中死亡率和资源利用的有效准确方法，证明了使用提示学习和Transformer编码器分析多模态EHR的成功，并显示出对结构化数据损坏的强大韧性。

Abstract: Background Predicting mortality and resource utilization from electronic
health records (EHRs) is challenging yet crucial for optimizing patient
outcomes and managing costs in intensive care unit (ICU). Existing approaches
predominantly focus on structured EHRs, often ignoring the valuable clinical
insights in free-text notes. Additionally, the potential of textual information
within structured data is not fully leveraged. This study aimed to introduce
and assess a deep learning framework using natural language processing
techniques that integrates multimodal EHRs to predict mortality and resource
utilization in critical care settings. Methods Utilizing two real-world EHR
datasets, we developed and evaluated our model on three clinical tasks with
leading existing methods. We also performed an ablation study on three key
components in our framework: medical prompts, free-texts, and pre-trained
sentence encoder. Furthermore, we assessed the model's robustness against the
corruption in structured EHRs. Results Our experiments on two real-world
datasets across three clinical tasks showed that our proposed model improved
performance metrics by 1.6\%/0.8\% on BACC/AUROC for mortality prediction,
0.5%/2.2% on RMSE/MAE for LOS prediction, 10.9%/11.0% on RMSE/MAE for surgical
duration estimation compared to the best existing methods. It consistently
demonstrated superior performance compared to other baselines across three
tasks at different corruption rates. Conclusions The proposed framework is an
effective and accurate deep learning approach for predicting mortality and
resource utilization in critical care. The study also highlights the success of
using prompt learning with a transformer encoder in analyzing multimodal EHRs.
Importantly, the model showed strong resilience to data corruption within
structured data, especially at high corruption levels.

Motivation: 阴谋论侵蚀公众对科学和机构的信任，且随着AI生成虚假信息的日益复杂，理解阴谋论内容的修辞模式对于制定干预措施和评估AI漏洞至关重要。

Method: 引入ConspirED数据集，基于CONSPIR认知框架标注在线阴谋论文章的多句摘录，开发计算模型识别认知特征，并评估大语言模型对阴谋论输入的响应。

Result: 发现大语言模型在处理阴谋论内容时会产生与输入推理模式相似的输出，即使能够成功处理类似的事实核查错误信息。

Conclusion: ConspirED是第一个标注阴谋论内容一般认知特征的数据集，揭示了AI模型在处理阴谋论内容时的对齐问题，为干预措施和模型改进提供了基础。

Abstract: Conspiracy theories erode public trust in science and institutions while
resisting debunking by evolving and absorbing counter-evidence. As AI-generated
misinformation becomes increasingly sophisticated, understanding rhetorical
patterns in conspiratorial content is important for developing interventions
such as targeted prebunking and assessing AI vulnerabilities. We introduce
ConspirED (CONSPIR Evaluation Dataset), which captures the cognitive traits of
conspiratorial ideation in multi-sentence excerpts (80--120 words) from online
conspiracy articles, annotated using the CONSPIR cognitive framework
(Lewandowsky and Cook, 2020). ConspirED is the first dataset of conspiratorial
content annotated for general cognitive traits. Using ConspirED, we (i) develop
computational models that identify conspiratorial traits and determine dominant
traits in text excerpts, and (ii) evaluate large language/reasoning model
(LLM/LRM) robustness to conspiratorial inputs. We find that both are misaligned
by conspiratorial content, producing output that mirrors input reasoning
patterns, even when successfully deflecting comparable fact-checked
misinformation.

TL;DR: FLORES+多语言机器翻译基准在四个语言（Asante Twi、日语、Jinghpaw和南阿塞拜疆语）中存在严重质量问题，翻译质量低于声称的90%标准，存在文化偏见和领域特异性问题，需要更通用的领域和文化中立的基准。


<details>

Motivation: 评估广泛使用的FLORES+多语言机器翻译基准的真实质量和适用性，发现其在真正多语言评估中的关键缺陷

Method: 通过人工评估四个语言的数据质量，分析翻译质量、领域特异性和文化偏见，并使用简单启发式方法（如复制命名实体）测试评估协议的脆弱性

Result: 许多翻译质量低于90%标准，源句子过于领域特定且偏向英语世界文化，简单启发式方法可获得不错的BLEU分数，高质量MT模型在FLORES+上表现差但在领域相关评估集上表现好

Conclusion: 需要建立使用领域通用和文化中立源文本、减少对命名实体依赖的多语言MT基准，以更好地反映真实世界的翻译挑战

Abstract: Multilingual machine translation (MT) benchmarks play a central role in
evaluating the capabilities of modern MT systems. Among them, the FLORES+
benchmark is widely used, offering English-to-many translation data for over
200 languages, curated with strict quality control protocols. However, we study
data in four languages (Asante Twi, Japanese, Jinghpaw, and South Azerbaijani)
and uncover critical shortcomings in the benchmark's suitability for truly
multilingual evaluation. Human assessments reveal that many translations fall
below the claimed 90% quality standard, and the annotators report that source
sentences are often too domain-specific and culturally biased toward the
English-speaking world. We further demonstrate that simple heuristics, such as
copying named entities, can yield non-trivial BLEU scores, suggesting
vulnerabilities in the evaluation protocol. Notably, we show that MT models
trained on high-quality, naturalistic data perform poorly on FLORES+ while
achieving significant gains on our domain-relevant evaluation set. Based on
these findings, we advocate for multilingual MT benchmarks that use
domain-general and culturally neutral source texts rely less on named entities,
in order to better reflect real-world translation challenges.

Conclusion: SciTopic通过大语言模型增强的主题发现方法，有效解决了传统方法在科学文献理解方面的局限性，为研究者提供了更好的主题发现工具。

Abstract: Topic discovery in scientific literature provides valuable insights for
researchers to identify emerging trends and explore new avenues for
investigation, facilitating easier scientific information retrieval. Many
machine learning methods, particularly deep embedding techniques, have been
applied to discover research topics. However, most existing topic discovery
methods rely on word embedding to capture the semantics and lack a
comprehensive understanding of scientific publications, struggling with
complex, high-dimensional text relationships. Inspired by the exceptional
comprehension of textual information by large language models (LLMs), we
propose an advanced topic discovery method enhanced by LLMs to improve
scientific topic identification, namely SciTopic. Specifically, we first build
a textual encoder to capture the content from scientific publications,
including metadata, title, and abstract. Next, we construct a space
optimization module that integrates entropy-based sampling and triplet tasks
guided by LLMs, enhancing the focus on thematic relevance and contextual
intricacies between ambiguous instances. Then, we propose to fine-tune the
textual encoder based on the guidance from the LLMs by optimizing the
contrastive loss of the triplets, forcing the text encoder to better
discriminate instances of different topics. Finally, extensive experiments
conducted on three real-world datasets of scientific publications demonstrate
that SciTopic outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) scientific topic
discovery methods, enabling researchers to gain deeper and faster insights.

### [121] [Adaptive Federated Distillation for Multi-Domain Non-IID Textual Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20557)
*Jiahao Xiao,Jiangming Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个针对多领域非IID数据的自适应联邦蒸馏框架(AdaFD)，建立了包含语言领域多样性的综合基准测试，在异构和同构设置下均取得优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦蒸馏研究主要关注标签(output)多样性，忽略了语言领域(input)多样性这一NLP中的关键因素，需要建立更真实的多领域非IID基准测试框架。

Method: 提出了自适应联邦蒸馏(AdaFD)框架，设计多领域非IID场景的统一基准测试，能够处理同构和异构设置下的多领域数据分布差异。

Result: 实验结果表明，AdaFD模型能够有效捕捉本地客户端的多样性，在性能上优于现有工作。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了联邦学习中语言领域多样性评估的空白，提出的AdaFD框架和基准测试为真实环境下的联邦学习评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The widespread success of pre-trained language models has established a new
training paradigm, where a global PLM is fine-tuned using task-specific data
from local clients. The local data are highly different from each other and can
not capture the global distribution of the whole data in real world. To address
the challenges of non-IID data in real environments, privacy-preserving
federated distillation has been proposed and highly investigated. However,
previous experimental non-IID scenarios are primarily identified with the label
(output) diversity, without considering the diversity of language domains
(input) that is crucial in natural language processing. In this paper, we
introduce a comprehensive set of multi-domain non-IID scenarios and propose a
unified benchmarking framework that includes diverse data. The benchmark can be
used to evaluate the federated learning framework in a real environment. To
this end, we propose an Adaptive Federated Distillation (AdaFD) framework
designed to address multi-domain non-IID challenges in both homogeneous and
heterogeneous settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our models
capture the diversity of local clients and achieve better performance compared
to the existing works. The code for this paper is available at:

*Zeyu Xiong,Yixuan Nan,Li Gao,Hengzhu Tang,Shuaiqiang Wang,Junfeng Wang,Dawei Yin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一个基于生成模型的查询驱动文本摘要框架，通过大模型蒸馏、监督微调、直接偏好优化和前瞻解码技术，将仅0.1B参数的轻量级模型转化为领域专业化的QDTS专家，在工业网络搜索中实现了实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于排序候选摘要片段的抽取式摘要模型存在多阶段流水线导致的信息累积损失和架构瓶颈，以及对用户查询和文档语义理解不足的问题，特别是在处理复杂搜索意图时表现不佳。

Method: 集成大模型蒸馏、监督微调、直接偏好优化和前瞻解码技术，将轻量级模型（0.1B参数）转化为专业QDTS模型。

Result: 在多个行业相关指标上超越生产基线并达到新的最先进水平，部署效率优异，仅需334个NVIDIA L20 GPU即可在55ms平均延迟下处理约50,000查询/秒。

Conclusion: 生成模型在工业级查询驱动文本摘要任务中具有显著优势，能够有效解决传统方法的局限性，实现高效实时的摘要生成。

Abstract: In the dynamic landscape of large-scale web search, Query-Driven Text
Summarization (QDTS) aims to generate concise and informative summaries from
textual documents based on a given query, which is essential for improving user
engagement and facilitating rapid decision-making. Traditional extractive
summarization models, based primarily on ranking candidate summary segments,
have been the dominant approach in industrial applications. However, these
approaches suffer from two key limitations: 1) The multi-stage pipeline often
introduces cumulative information loss and architectural bottlenecks due to its
weakest component; 2) Traditional models lack sufficient semantic understanding
of both user queries and documents, particularly when dealing with complex
search intents. In this study, we propose a novel framework to pioneer the
application of generative models to address real-time QDTS in industrial web
search. Our approach integrates large model distillation, supervised
fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and lookahead decoding to
transform a lightweight model with only 0.1B parameters into a
domain-specialized QDTS expert. Evaluated on multiple industry-relevant
metrics, our model outperforms the production baseline and achieves a new state
of the art. Furthermore, it demonstrates excellent deployment efficiency,
requiring only 334 NVIDIA L20 GPUs to handle \textasciitilde50,000 queries per
second under 55~ms average latency per query.

TL;DR: KCS框架通过知识组合采样增强多跳问答的数据多样性，提高知识组合选择准确率3.9%，并在HotpotQA和2WikiMultihopQA数据集上取得改进


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多跳问答中数据稀疏性问题，防止语言模型学习虚假模式，现有方法忽视关键知识整合

Method: 知识组合采样框架，将知识组合选择建模为句子级条件预测任务，使用概率对比损失预测相关知识，采用随机解码策略平衡准确性和多样性

Result: 知识组合选择准确率提升3.9%，在HotpotQA和2WikiMultihopQA数据集上通过数据增强获得性能改进

Conclusion: KCS框架有效提升了多跳问答的数据多样性和模型性能，为知识密集型任务提供了新的数据增强方法

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering faces substantial challenges due to data
sparsity, which increases the likelihood of language models learning spurious
patterns. To address this issue, prior research has focused on diversifying
question generation through content planning and varied expression. However,
these approaches often emphasize generating simple questions and neglect the
integration of essential knowledge, such as relevant sentences within
documents. This paper introduces the Knowledge Composition Sampling (KCS), an
innovative framework designed to expand the diversity of generated multi-hop
questions by sampling varied knowledge compositions within a given context. KCS
models the knowledge composition selection as a sentence-level conditional
prediction task and utilizes a probabilistic contrastive loss to predict the
next most relevant piece of knowledge. During inference, we employ a stochastic
decoding strategy to effectively balance accuracy and diversity. Compared to
competitive baselines, our KCS improves the overall accuracy of knowledge
composition selection by 3.9%, and its application for data augmentation yields
improvements on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA datasets. Our code is available

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 当前图语言模型(GLM)的评估基准存在缺陷，无法真正评估多模态推理能力。研究者提出了新的CLEGR基准来测试图结构和语言的联合推理，发现现有GLM在图推理方面表现不佳，甚至与仅使用语言模型的基线相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GLM评估基准主要基于重用的节点分类数据集，这些基准无法有效评估多模态推理能力，因为仅使用单模态信息就能在这些基准上取得良好表现，不能真正测试图语言整合的必要性。

Method: 提出了CLEGR(组合式语言-图推理)基准，采用合成图生成流程配合需要结构和文本语义联合推理的问题。对代表性GLM架构进行全面评估，包括与仅使用软提示的LLM基线进行比较。

Result: 研究发现软提示的LLM基线表现与包含完整GNN骨干的GLM相当，质疑了将图结构整合到LLM中的架构必要性。GLM在需要结构推理的任务中表现出显著的性能下降。

Conclusion: 当前GLM在图推理能力方面存在明显局限性，CLEGR基准为推进社区发展提供了基础，促使研究者关注涉及图结构和语言的显式多模态推理。

Abstract: Developments in Graph-Language Models (GLMs) aim to integrate the structural
reasoning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the semantic
understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, we demonstrate that
current evaluation benchmarks for GLMs, which are primarily repurposed
node-level classification datasets, are insufficient to assess multimodal
reasoning. Our analysis reveals that strong performance on these benchmarks is
achievable using unimodal information alone, suggesting that they do not
necessitate graph-language integration. To address this evaluation gap, we
introduce the CLEGR(Compositional Language-Graph Reasoning) benchmark, designed
to evaluate multimodal reasoning at various complexity levels. Our benchmark
employs a synthetic graph generation pipeline paired with questions that
require joint reasoning over structure and textual semantics. We perform a
thorough evaluation of representative GLM architectures and find that
soft-prompted LLM baselines perform on par with GLMs that incorporate a full
GNN backbone. This result calls into question the architectural necessity of
incorporating graph structure into LLMs. We further show that GLMs exhibit
significant performance degradation in tasks that require structural reasoning.
These findings highlight limitations in the graph reasoning capabilities of
current GLMs and provide a foundation for advancing the community toward
explicit multimodal reasoning involving graph structure and language.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种利用语音声音特征来编正语音识别中域特定实体错误的新方法，解决了当错误词和正确实体形式差异较大时传统方法失效的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构化识别系统在识别域特定实体名称时常常失败，而现有的域特定实体编正模型在错误词和正确实体形式差异较大时效果有限。

Method: 提出了一种新的域特定实体编正方法，利用语音声音特征来检索候选实体，然后设计了生成式方法来标注并替换错误实体。

Result: 通过开源测试集和自建测试集的实验，证明该方法能够显著提高实体识别的准确性。

Conclusion: 该新方法在字形差异较大的场景下仍然有效，为域特定实体编正提供了更好的解决方案，并将开源相关测试集和训练数据。

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition systems often fail to transcribe
domain-specific named entities, causing catastrophic failures in downstream
tasks. Numerous fast and lightweight named entity correction (NEC) models have
been proposed in recent years. These models, mainly leveraging phonetic-level
edit distance algorithms, have shown impressive performances. However, when the
forms of the wrongly-transcribed words(s) and the ground-truth entity are
significantly different, these methods often fail to locate the wrongly
transcribed words in hypothesis, thus limiting their usage. We propose a novel
NEC method that utilizes speech sound features to retrieve candidate entities.
With speech sound features and candidate entities, we inovatively design a
generative method to annotate entity errors in ASR transcripts and replace the
text with correct entities. This method is effective in scenarios of word form
difference. We test our method using open-source and self-constructed test
sets. The results demonstrate that our NEC method can bring significant
improvement to entity accuracy. We will open source our self-constructed test
set and training data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个多语言多标签隐式篇章关系识别模型HArch，在DiscoGeM语料上验证了其有效性，并在多语言设置下优于GPT-4o和Llama-4-Maverick等大模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的隐式篇章关系识别方法主要针对单语言和单标签设置，缺乏对多语言和多层次标签的联合建模能力。

Method: 提出HArch模型，利用篇章意义的层次依赖关系，在PDTB 3.0框架下预测三个层次的概率分布，并比较了多种预训练编码器骨干网络。

Result: RoBERTa-HArch在英语上表现最佳，XLM-RoBERTa-HArch在多语言设置下最优，微调模型在所有语言配置下均优于GPT-4o和Llama-4-Maverick。

Conclusion: 任务特定的微调在隐式篇章关系识别中优于提示方法，层次化方法在DiscoGeM语料上取得了最先进的结果。

Abstract: This paper introduces the first multi-lingual and multi-label classification
model for implicit discourse relation recognition (IDRR). Our model, HArch, is
evaluated on the recently released DiscoGeM 2.0 corpus and leverages
hierarchical dependencies between discourse senses to predict probability
distributions across all three sense levels in the PDTB 3.0 framework. We
compare several pre-trained encoder backbones and find that RoBERTa-HArch
achieves the best performance in English, while XLM-RoBERTa-HArch performs best
in the multi-lingual setting. In addition, we compare our fine-tuned models
against GPT-4o and Llama-4-Maverick using few-shot prompting across all
language configurations. Our results show that our fine-tuned models
consistently outperform these LLMs, highlighting the advantages of
task-specific fine-tuning over prompting in IDRR. Finally, we report SOTA
results on the DiscoGeM 1.0 corpus, further validating the effectiveness of our
hierarchical approach.

*Ruiyi Yan,Yugo Murawaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究针对文本隐写和水印中tokenization不一致性问题，提出了基于问题token特征（低频性和临时性）的两种解决方案：逐步验证方法用于隐写，后验回滚方法用于水印，实验证明能显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型提升了文本生成能力，一方面改善了文本隐写质量，另一方面也凸显了水印技术防止恶意滥用的重要性。研究发现tokenization不一致性会破坏鲁棒性，需要针对性解决方案。

Method: 识别出导致tokenization不一致的问题token具有低频性和临时性两个特征，基于此提出了两种定制化解决方案：1）针对隐写的逐步验证方法；2）针对水印的后验回滚方法。

Result: 实验表明：1）与传统消歧方法相比，直接解决tokenization不一致性可提升隐写的流畅性、不可感知性和抗隐写分析能力；2）对于水印，解决该问题能增强可检测性和抗攻击鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究通过分析tokenization不一致性的根本特征，提出了有效的解决方案，显著提升了文本隐写和水印技术的性能表现，为相关领域提供了重要的技术改进。

Abstract: Large language models have significantly enhanced the capacities and
efficiency of text generation. On the one hand, they have improved the quality
of text-based steganography. On the other hand, they have also underscored the
importance of watermarking as a safeguard against malicious misuse. In this
study, we focus on tokenization inconsistency (TI) between Alice and Bob in
steganography and watermarking, where TI can undermine robustness. Our
investigation reveals that the problematic tokens responsible for TI exhibit
two key characteristics: infrequency and temporariness. Based on these
findings, we propose two tailored solutions for TI elimination: a stepwise
verification method for steganography and a post-hoc rollback method for
watermarking. Experiments show that (1) compared to traditional disambiguation
methods in steganography, directly addressing TI leads to improvements in
fluency, imperceptibility, and anti-steganalysis capacity; (2) for
watermarking, addressing TI enhances detectability and robustness against
attacks.

TL;DR: rStar2-Agent是一个14B参数的数学推理模型，通过智能体强化学习训练，在有限GPU资源下实现前沿性能，在AIME数学竞赛中超越DeepSeek-R1等大型模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数学推理模型主要依赖长思维链，缺乏自主探索、验证和优化中间步骤的高级认知能力，需要开发更高效的智能体强化学习方法

Method: 采用三项关键技术：高效RL基础设施支持高吞吐代码执行、GRPO-RoC算法处理编码工具环境噪声、多阶段RL训练流程从非推理SFT逐步提升

Result: 仅用510步RL训练和一周时间，在AIME24和AIME25上分别达到80.6%和69.8%的pass@1分数，超越671B参数的DeepSeek-R1，响应更短

Conclusion: 该方法证明小模型通过智能体RL训练可以实现前沿数学推理性能，并具有良好的泛化能力，适用于对齐、科学推理和工具使用任务

Abstract: We introduce rStar2-Agent, a 14B math reasoning model trained with agentic
reinforcement learning to achieve frontier-level performance. Beyond current
long CoT, the model demonstrates advanced cognitive behaviors, such as thinking
carefully before using Python coding tools and reflecting on code execution
feedback to autonomously explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps in
complex problem-solving. This capability is enabled through three key
innovations that makes agentic RL effective at scale: (i) an efficient RL
infrastructure with a reliable Python code environment that supports
high-throughput execution and mitigates the high rollout costs, enabling
training on limited GPU resources (64 MI300X GPUs); (ii) GRPO-RoC, an agentic
RL algorithm with a Resample-on-Correct rollout strategy that addresses the
inherent environment noises from coding tools, allowing the model to reason
more effectively in a code environment; (iii) An efficient agent training
recipe that starts with non-reasoning SFT and progresses through multi-RL
stages, yielding advanced cognitive abilities with minimal compute cost. To
this end, rStar2-Agent boosts a pre-trained 14B model to state of the art in
only 510 RL steps within one week, achieving average pass@1 scores of 80.6% on
AIME24 and 69.8% on AIME25, surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B) with significantly
shorter responses. Beyond mathematics, rStar2-Agent-14B also demonstrates
strong generalization to alignment, scientific reasoning, and agentic tool-use
tasks. Code and training recipes are available at

*Stephen Meisenbacher,Maulik Chevli,Florian Matthes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了DP-ST方法，利用语义三元组在本地差分隐私下实现邻域感知的私有文档生成，通过分治策略和LLM后处理在较低ε值下实现隐私与效用的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有本地差分隐私文本处理方法在低ε值下效果不佳，需要一种能够在合理隐私预算下保持文本连贯性的新方法。

Method: 使用语义三元组进行分治处理，结合LLM后处理生成连贯文本，限制隐私保护范围到特定的邻域概念。

Result: 该方法在较低ε值下仍能生成连贯文本，有效平衡了隐私保护和文本效用。

Conclusion: 文本连贯性对于在合理ε水平下实现平衡的隐私保护输出至关重要，分治策略结合LLM处理是有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Many works at the intersection of Differential Privacy (DP) in Natural
Language Processing aim to protect privacy by transforming texts under DP
guarantees. This can be performed in a variety of ways, from word perturbations
to full document rewriting, and most often under local DP. Here, an input text
must be made indistinguishable from any other potential text, within some bound
governed by the privacy parameter $\varepsilon$. Such a guarantee is quite
demanding, and recent works show that privatizing texts under local DP can only
be done reasonably under very high $\varepsilon$ values. Addressing this
challenge, we introduce DP-ST, which leverages semantic triples for
neighborhood-aware private document generation under local DP guarantees.
Through the evaluation of our method, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
divide-and-conquer paradigm, particularly when limiting the DP notion (and
privacy guarantees) to that of a privatization neighborhood. When combined with
LLM post-processing, our method allows for coherent text generation even at
lower $\varepsilon$ values, while still balancing privacy and utility. These
findings highlight the importance of coherence in achieving balanced
privatization outputs at reasonable $\varepsilon$ levels.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过细调基于LLM的通用嵌入模型，在隐式性恨言识别任务中实现了最先进性能，特别是在跨数据集评估中显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式性恨言（IHS）通过隐蕴符号、谬刺或编码术语传递偏见和恨意，因其没有明显谬称性词汇而难以检测。传统方法需要外部知识或额外信息，如上下文、情感和情感数据

Method: 仅通过细调最新的通用嵌入模型（基于大语言模型），包括Stella、Jasper、NV-Embed和E5模型，而不需要额外外部知识或复杂流程

Result: 在多个IHS数据集上进行实验，在数据集内评估中F1-macro指标提升了1.10个百分点，在跨数据集评估中更是达到了20.35个百分点的显著提升

Conclusion: 简单的细调通用嵌入模型方法能够在隐式性恨言检测任务中实现最先进的性能，特别是在模型迁移能力方面显示出优异效果，这为IHS检测提供了一种更简洁有效的解决方案

Abstract: Implicit hate speech (IHS) is indirect language that conveys prejudice or
hatred through subtle cues, sarcasm or coded terminology. IHS is challenging to
detect as it does not include explicit derogatory or inflammatory words. To
address this challenge, task-specific pipelines can be complemented with
external knowledge or additional information such as context, emotions and
sentiment data. In this paper, we show that, by solely fine-tuning recent
general-purpose embedding models based on large language models (LLMs), such as
Stella, Jasper, NV-Embed and E5, we achieve state-of-the-art performance.
Experiments on multiple IHS datasets show up to 1.10 percentage points
improvements for in-dataset, and up to 20.35 percentage points improvements in
cross-dataset evaluation, in terms of F1-macro score.

TL;DR: GUARD是一种自适应的解码方法，通过全局和局部不确定性信号平衡文本生成的连贯性和多样性，同时显著提高生成速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放式文本生成中连贯性与多样性平衡的挑战，现有对比搜索方法存在超参数依赖和计算成本高的问题。

Method: 提出GUARD方法，结合全局熵估计和局部熵偏差，采用"Glocal"不确定性驱动框架，并加入基于token计数的惩罚机制来降低计算开销。

Result: 实验表明GUARD在文本多样性和连贯性之间取得良好平衡，生成速度大幅提升，人类和LLM评估者均验证了其优异性能。

Conclusion: GUARD提供了一种有效且高效的解码策略，解决了现有方法的局限性，在保持文本质量的同时显著提升了生成效率。

Abstract: Open-ended text generation faces a critical challenge: balancing coherence
with diversity in LLM outputs. While contrastive search-based decoding
strategies have emerged to address this trade-off, their practical utility is
often limited by hyperparameter dependence and high computational costs. We
introduce GUARD, a self-adaptive decoding method that effectively balances
these competing objectives through a novel "Glocal" uncertainty-driven
framework. GUARD combines global entropy estimates with local entropy
deviations to integrate both long-term and short-term uncertainty signals. We
demonstrate that our proposed global entropy formulation effectively mitigates
abrupt variations in uncertainty, such as sudden overconfidence or high entropy
spikes, and provides theoretical guarantees of unbiasedness and consistency. To
reduce computational overhead, we incorporate a simple yet effective
token-count-based penalty into GUARD. Experimental results demonstrate that
GUARD achieves a good balance between text diversity and coherence, while
exhibiting substantial improvements in generation speed. In a more nuanced
comparison study across different dimensions of text quality, both human and
LLM evaluators validated its remarkable performance. Our code is available at

Abstract: Synthetic therapy dialogues generated by large language models (LLMs) are
increasingly used in mental health NLP to simulate counseling scenarios, train
models, and supplement limited real-world data. However, it remains unclear
whether these synthetic conversations capture the nuanced emotional dynamics of
real therapy. In this work, we conduct the first comparative analysis of
emotional arcs between real and LLM-generated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
dialogues. We adapt the Utterance Emotion Dynamics framework to analyze
fine-grained affective trajectories across valence, arousal, and dominance
dimensions. Our analysis spans both full dialogues and individual speaker roles
(counselor and client), using real sessions transcribed from public videos and
synthetic dialogues from the CACTUS dataset. We find that while synthetic
dialogues are fluent and structurally coherent, they diverge from real
conversations in key emotional properties: real sessions exhibit greater
emotional variability,more emotion-laden language, and more authentic patterns
of reactivity and regulation. Moreover, emotional arc similarity between real
and synthetic speakers is low, especially for clients. These findings
underscore the limitations of current LLM-generated therapy data and highlight
the importance of emotional fidelity in mental health applications. We
introduce RealCBT, a curated dataset of real CBT sessions, to support future
research in this space.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ROSI是一种白盒方法，通过永久性地将模型激活转向拒绝调节子空间来增强LLM的安全对齐，无需微调即可提高安全拒绝率并保持模型效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全对齐机制容易被绕过，需要一种更有效的方法来增强模型的安全性能。

Method: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI)，通过对所有残差流写入矩阵应用简单的秩一权重修改，将激活转向拒绝调节子空间。

Result: ROSI持续提高安全拒绝率（Llama Guard 3评估），同时在MMLU、HellaSwag和Arc等标准基准测试中保持模型效用，还能重新对齐'未审查'模型。

Conclusion: 定向、可解释的权重引导是改善LLM安全的廉价而有效的机制，可作为资源密集型微调范式的补充。

Abstract: Safety alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) often involves mediating
internal representations to refuse harmful requests. Recent research has
demonstrated that these safety mechanisms can be bypassed by ablating or
removing specific representational directions within the model. In this paper,
we propose the opposite approach: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI), a white-box
method that amplifies a model's safety alignment by permanently steering its
activations toward the refusal-mediating subspace. ROSI operates as a simple,
fine-tuning-free rank-one weight modification applied to all residual stream
write matrices. The required safety direction can be computed from a small set
of harmful and harmless instruction pairs. We show that ROSI consistently
increases safety refusal rates - as evaluated by Llama Guard 3 - while
preserving the utility of the model on standard benchmarks such as MMLU,
HellaSwag, and Arc. Furthermore, we show that ROSI can also re-align
'uncensored' models by amplifying their own latent safety directions,
demonstrating its utility as an effective last-mile safety procedure. Our
results suggest that targeted, interpretable weight steering is a cheap and
potent mechanism to improve LLM safety, complementing more resource-intensive
fine-tuning paradigms.

Motivation: 青少年心理健康问题日益严重，需要自动化方法从数字文本中检测心理困扰的早期迹象，特别是识别可能加剧心理困扰的非理性思维模式（认知扭曲）

Method: 研究跨语言和跨文本类型的泛化能力，分析荷兰青少年论坛帖子，比较不同领域适应方法

Result: 语言和写作风格的改变会显著影响模型性能，但领域适应方法显示出最大的潜力

Conclusion: 虽然语言和文本类型的变化对认知扭曲检测有重要影响，但通过适当的领域适应技术可以改善跨语言和跨文本类型的检测效果

Abstract: Rising mental health issues among youth have increased interest in automated
approaches for detecting early signs of psychological distress in digital text.
One key focus is the identification of cognitive distortions, irrational
thought patterns that have a role in aggravating mental distress. Early
detection of these distortions may enable timely, low-cost interventions. While
prior work has focused on English clinical data, we present the first in-depth
study of cross-lingual and cross-register generalization of cognitive
distortion detection, analyzing forum posts written by Dutch adolescents. Our
findings show that while changes in language and writing style can
significantly affect model performance, domain adaptation methods show the most
promise.

Conclusion: GDLLM框架通过有效捕获全局特征，能够显著增强少数关系类的性能，并提升整体学习能力，在事件时序关系抽取任务中表现出色。

Abstract: In Natural Language Processing(NLP), Event Temporal Relation Extraction
(ETRE) is to recognize the temporal relations of two events. Prior studies have
noted the importance of language models for ETRE. However, the restricted
pre-trained knowledge of Small Language Models(SLMs) limits their capability to
handle minority class relations in imbalanced classification datasets. For
Large Language Models(LLMs), researchers adopt manually designed prompts or
instructions, which may introduce extra noise, leading to interference with the
model's judgment of the long-distance dependencies between events. To address
these issues, we propose GDLLM, a Global Distance-aware modeling approach based
on LLMs. We first present a distance-aware graph structure utilizing Graph
Attention Network(GAT) to assist the LLMs in capturing long-distance dependency
features. Additionally, we design a temporal feature learning paradigm based on
soft inference to augment the identification of relations with a short-distance
proximity band, which supplements the probabilistic information generated by
LLMs into the multi-head attention mechanism. Since the global feature can be
captured effectively, our framework substantially enhances the performance of
minority relation classes and improves the overall learning ability.
Experiments on two publicly available datasets, TB-Dense and MATRES,
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

*Rohan Phanse,Yijie Zhou,Kejian Shi,Wencai Zhang,Yixin Liu,Yilun Zhao,Arman Cohan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个可扩展的评测框架，用于构建多源检索和综合的RAG系统评测基准，解决实际应用中需要从多个来源整合信息的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际应用中很多情况需要从多个分散源整合和汇总信息，而现有RAG系统评估多假设信息在单个源中或答案短式。

Method: 提出可扩展的评测框架，并构建了两个新的多源检索和综合基准：MSRS-Story（故事综合）和MSRS-Meet（会议摘要），进行了浓度和稀疏检索器与前沿LLM组合的实验。

Result: 生成质量很大程度取决于检索效果，且不同任务间差异显著。多源综合在神谕检索设置下也很具挑战，理解模型在综合步骤表现显著超过标准LLM。

Conclusion: 多源信息整合是RAG系统的关键挑战，需要同时改善检索和生成组件。提供的评测框架和基准为评估这些能力提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented systems are typically evaluated in settings where
information required to answer the query can be found within a single source or
the answer is short-form or factoid-based. However, many real-world
applications demand the ability to integrate and summarize information
scattered across multiple sources, where no single source is sufficient to
respond to the user's question. In such settings, the retrieval component of a
RAG pipeline must recognize a variety of relevance signals, and the generation
component must connect and synthesize information across multiple sources. We
present a scalable framework for constructing evaluation benchmarks that
challenge RAG systems to integrate information across distinct sources and
generate long-form responses. Using our framework, we build two new benchmarks
on Multi-Source Retrieval and Synthesis: MSRS-Story and MSRS-Meet, representing
narrative synthesis and summarization tasks, respectively, that require
retrieval from large collections. Our extensive experiments with various RAG
pipelines -- including sparse and dense retrievers combined with frontier LLMs
-- reveal that generation quality is highly dependent on retrieval
effectiveness, which varies greatly by task. While multi-source synthesis
proves challenging even in an oracle retrieval setting, we find that reasoning
models significantly outperform standard LLMs at this distinct step.

### [138] [The Uneven Impact of Post-Training Quantization in Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20893)
*Benjamin Marie,Atsushi Fujita*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文首次大规模评估后训练量化技术在55种语言的机器翻译任务中的表现，发现4位量化在高资源语言和大模型中能保持质量，但2位量化对低资源和语言类型多样的语言造成显著性能下降。GGUF方法表现最为稳定，语言匹配的检验集在低位量化中有明显优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化技术对在资源受限硬件上部署大语言模型至关重要，但其在多语言任务中的影响仍未得到充分探索。需要系统性地评估量化对不同语言特别是低资源语言的机器翻译质量的影响。

Method: 使用5个参数从1.7B到70B的大语言模型，在55种语言上进行后训练量化评估。比较四种量化技术（AWQ、BitsAndBytes、GGUF和自动四舍五入），分析4位和2位量化的表现。分析量化与解码超参数、检验集语言之间的相互作用，并采用语言匹配的检验集策略。

Result: 研究发现4位量化在高资源语言和大模型中能保持翻译质量，但2位量化对低资源和语言类型多样的语言造成显著性能下降。GGUF方法在各种量化精度下都提供最一致的性能，甚至在2位精度下也保持良好表现。语言匹配的检验集在低位量化场景中显示出明显优势。

Conclusion: 量化算法的选择和模型大小共同决定了多语言机器翻译的稳健性。对于低资源语言部署，建议优先考虑GGUF量化方法和语言匹配的检验集策略，特别是在极端量化情况下。这些发现为在量化约束下部署多语言大语言模型提供了可操作的实践指南。

Abstract: Quantization is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) on
resource-constrained hardware, but its implications for multilingual tasks
remain underexplored. We conduct the first large-scale evaluation of
post-training quantization (PTQ) on machine translation across 55 languages
using five LLMs ranging from 1.7B to 70B parameters. Our analysis reveals that
while 4-bit quantization often preserves translation quality for high-resource
languages and large models, significant degradation occurs for low-resource and
typologically diverse languages, particularly in 2-bit settings. We compare
four quantization techniques (AWQ, BitsAndBytes, GGUF, and AutoRound), showing
that algorithm choice and model size jointly determine robustness. GGUF
variants provide the most consistent performance, even at 2-bit precision.
Additionally, we quantify the interactions between quantization, decoding
hyperparameters, and calibration languages, finding that language-matched
calibration offers benefits primarily in low-bit scenarios. Our findings offer
actionable insights for deploying multilingual LLMs for machine translation
under quantization constraints, especially in low-resource settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音到语音大语言模型的评估存在根本性挑战，级联方法忽略了声学特征，且缺乏可解释性和语音偏好数据稀缺。

Method: 提出SageLM模型：1）联合评估语义和声学维度；2）使用基于原理的监督增强可解释性；3）构建SpeechFeedback合成偏好数据集，采用两阶段训练范式。

Result: SageLM达到82.79%的人类评估一致性，分别比级联方法和SLM基线高出至少7.42%和26.20%。

Conclusion: SageLM提供了一个全面、可解释的语音LLM评估框架，有效解决了现有评估方法的局限性，在语义和声学维度上都表现出色。

Abstract: Speech-to-Speech (S2S) Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational to
natural human-computer interaction, enabling end-to-end spoken dialogue
systems. However, evaluating these models remains a fundamental challenge. We
propose \texttt{SageLM}, an end-to-end, multi-aspect, and explainable speech
LLM for comprehensive S2S LLMs evaluation. First, unlike cascaded approaches
that disregard acoustic features, SageLM jointly assesses both semantic and
acoustic dimensions. Second, it leverages rationale-based supervision to
enhance explainability and guide model learning, achieving superior alignment
with evaluation outcomes compared to rule-based reinforcement learning methods.
Third, we introduce \textit{SpeechFeedback}, a synthetic preference dataset,
and employ a two-stage training paradigm to mitigate the scarcity of speech
preference data. Trained on both semantic and acoustic dimensions, SageLM
achieves an 82.79\% agreement rate with human evaluators, outperforming
cascaded and SLM-based baselines by at least 7.42\% and 26.20\%, respectively.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在多轮对话环境中作为自主代理使用工具时，存在推理不一致、违反领域策略和长时程信息提取困难等问题，需要改进

Method: 提出IRMA多智能体框架，自动重构用户查询，增强相关领域规则和工具建议，帮助工具调用智能体更好地聚焦关键信息

Result: IRMA在整体通过率上显著优于ReAct、函数调用和自我反思方法，分别提升16.1%、12.7%和19.1%

Conclusion: IRMA框架在动态环境中展现出比其他方法更优越的可靠性和一致性，为LLM工具使用提供了有效的改进方案

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning and planning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) have enabled their potential as autonomous agents capable of tool
use in dynamic environments. However, in multi-turn conversational environments
like $\tau$-bench, these agents often struggle with consistent reasoning,
adherence to domain-specific policies, and extracting correct information over
a long horizon of tool-calls and conversation. To capture and mitigate these
failures, we conduct a comprehensive manual analysis of the common errors
occurring in the conversation trajectories. We then experiment with
reformulations of inputs to the tool-calling agent for improvement in agent
decision making. Finally, we propose the Input-Reformulation Multi-Agent (IRMA)
framework, which automatically reformulates user queries augmented with
relevant domain rules and tool suggestions for the tool-calling agent to focus
on. The results show that IRMA significantly outperforms ReAct, Function
Calling, and Self-Reflection by 16.1%, 12.7%, and 19.1%, respectively, in
overall pass^5 scores. These findings highlight the superior reliability and
consistency of IRMA compared to other methods in dynamic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ICL示例选择策略往往忽视结构对齐，导致语义解析等结构化预测任务性能不佳和泛化能力差，需要一种能平衡效率、泛化性和性能的解决方案。

Method: 两阶段方法：1）使用结构感知监督微调BERT检索器，选择语义相关且结构对齐的示例；2）添加模型无关的可插拔模块，增强隐藏表示中的语法信息。

Result: 在四个基准测试和三个语义解析任务上的实验表明，该方法在使用多个最新LLM作为推理模型时，始终优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结构感知的示例选择和语法信息增强，有效提升了ICL在结构化预测任务中的性能，具有高效、泛化性强和易于集成的优点。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has become a powerful paradigm that enables LLMs to
perform a wide range of tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. However, the
effectiveness of ICL heavily depends on the quality of exemplar selection. In
particular, for structured prediction tasks such as semantic parsing, existing
ICL selection strategies often overlook structural alignment, leading to
suboptimal performance and poor generalization. To address this issue, we
propose a novel two-stage exemplar selection strategy that achieves a strong
balance between efficiency, generalizability, and performance. First, we
fine-tune a BERT-based retriever using structure-aware supervision, guiding it
to select exemplars that are both semantically relevant and structurally
aligned. Then, we enhance the retriever with a plug-in module, which amplifies
syntactically meaningful information in the hidden representations. This
plug-in is model-agnostic, requires minimal overhead, and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing pipelines. Experiments on four benchmarks spanning
three semantic parsing tasks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing baselines with multiple recent LLMs as inference-time
models.

Motivation: 现有主动对话研究主要集中在特定领域或任务导向场景，导致评估碎片化，限制了全面探索模型的主动对话能力。

Method: 提出ProactiveEval框架，将主动对话分解为目标规划和对话引导两个维度，建立跨领域评估指标，并支持自动生成多样化的评估数据。

Result: 在22种不同类型的大语言模型实验中，DeepSeek-R1在目标规划任务上表现优异，Claude-3.7-Sonnet在对话引导任务上表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究了推理能力对主动行为的影响，并讨论了其对未来模型发展的启示，为主动对话能力的系统评估提供了统一框架。

Abstract: Proactive dialogue has emerged as a critical and challenging research problem
in advancing large language models (LLMs). Existing works predominantly focus
on domain-specific or task-oriented scenarios, which leads to fragmented
evaluations and limits the comprehensive exploration of models' proactive
conversation abilities. In this work, we propose ProactiveEval, a unified
framework designed for evaluating proactive dialogue capabilities of LLMs. This
framework decomposes proactive dialogue into target planning and dialogue
guidance, establishing evaluation metrics across various domains. Moreover, it
also enables the automatic generation of diverse and challenging evaluation
data. Based on the proposed framework, we develop 328 evaluation environments
spanning 6 distinct domains. Through experiments with 22 different types of
LLMs, we show that DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-3.7-Sonnet exhibit exceptional
performance on target planning and dialogue guidance tasks, respectively.
Finally, we investigate how reasoning capabilities influence proactive
behaviors and discuss their implications for future model development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门防御方法存在局限性，无法全面应对模型编辑、多触发器和无触发器等高级攻击场景，需要更全面的防御方案。

Method: 内部使用轻量数据集训练干净模型并与后门模型融合来稀释恶意行为；外部在提示中添加良性证据来分散LLM对后门特征的注意力。

Result: 在5个主流LLM上的实验显示，LETHE优于8个先进防御基线，将高级后门攻击成功率降低达98%，同时保持模型效用。

Conclusion: LETHE是一种高效、经济且鲁棒的后门防御方法，能有效应对各种复杂的后门攻击场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen significant advancements, achieving
superior performance in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
However, they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where models behave
normally for standard queries but generate harmful responses or unintended
output when specific triggers are activated. Existing backdoor defenses either
lack comprehensiveness, focusing on narrow trigger settings, detection-only
mechanisms, and limited domains, or fail to withstand advanced scenarios like
model-editing-based, multi-trigger, and triggerless attacks. In this paper, we
present LETHE, a novel method to eliminate backdoor behaviors from LLMs through
knowledge dilution using both internal and external mechanisms. Internally,
LETHE leverages a lightweight dataset to train a clean model, which is then
merged with the backdoored model to neutralize malicious behaviors by diluting
the backdoor impact within the model's parametric memory. Externally, LETHE
incorporates benign and semantically relevant evidence into the prompt to
distract LLM's attention from backdoor features. Experimental results on
classification and generation domains across 5 widely used LLMs demonstrate
that LETHE outperforms 8 state-of-the-art defense baselines against 8 backdoor
attacks. LETHE reduces the attack success rate of advanced backdoor attacks by
up to 98% while maintaining model utility. Furthermore, LETHE has proven to be
cost-efficient and robust against adaptive backdoor attacks.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful solution to
mitigate the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
hallucinations and outdated knowledge. However, deploying RAG-based tools in
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) remains a challenge due to their limited
resources and lack of expertise in natural language processing (NLP). This
paper introduces EASI-RAG, Enterprise Application Support for Industrial RAG, a
structured, agile method designed to facilitate the deployment of RAG systems
in industrial SME contexts. EASI-RAG is based on method engineering principles
and comprises well-defined roles, activities, and techniques. The method was
validated through a real-world case study in an environmental testing
laboratory, where a RAG tool was implemented to answer operators queries using
data extracted from operational procedures. The system was deployed in under a
month by a team with no prior RAG experience and was later iteratively improved
based on user feedback. Results demonstrate that EASI-RAG supports fast
implementation, high user adoption, delivers accurate answers, and enhances the
reliability of underlying data. This work highlights the potential of RAG
deployment in industrial SMEs. Future works include the need for generalization
across diverse use cases and further integration with fine-tuned models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 句子关系抽取是NLP中的重要任务，现有方法在标准数据集上表现良好，但在更大规模的真实数据集上性能下降，需要探究其原因和改进方法。

Method: 采用胶囊网络中的动态路由机制进行句子关系抽取，通过胶囊间的动态信息传递来建模语义关系。

Result: 在Tacred、Tacredrev、Retacred和Conll04数据集上超越现有最佳方法，但在Wikidata数据集上表现较差，发现标签噪声是主要原因。同时证明该方法具有更好的重表征能力。

Conclusion: 除了标签噪声问题外，重表征能力是句子关系抽取中的重要挑战，胶囊网络的动态路由机制能够有效提升重表征效果。

Abstract: Sentential relation extraction (RE) is an important task in natural language
processing (NLP). In this paper we propose to do sentential RE with dynamic
routing in capsules. We first show that the proposed approach outperform state
of the art on common sentential relation extraction datasets Tacred, Tacredrev,
Retacred, and Conll04. We then investigate potential reasons for its good
performance on the mentioned datasets, and yet low performance on another
similar, yet larger sentential RE dataset, Wikidata. As such, we identify noise
in Wikidata labels as one of the reasons that can hinder performance.
Additionally, we show associativity of better performance with better
re-representation, a term from neuroscience referred to change of
representation in human brain to improve the match at comparison time. As
example, in the given analogous terms King:Queen::Man:Woman, at comparison
time, and as a result of re-representation, the similarity between related head
terms (King,Man), and tail terms (Queen,Woman) increases. As such, our
observation show that our proposed model can do re-representation better than
the vanilla model compared with. To that end, beside noise in the labels of the
distantly supervised RE datasets, we propose re-representation as a challenge
in sentential RE.

Motivation: 税务申报需要复杂的规则推理和数值计算，传统方法容易出错且成本高昂，而纯LLM方法缺乏准确性和可审计性，需要一种结合神经和符号方法的可靠解决方案。

Method: 整合大型语言模型与符号求解器，将明文税务规则翻译为形式逻辑程序，并结合智能检索的案例表示范例来提升性能。

Conclusion: 神经符号架构在提供可靠税务援助方面具有巨大潜力和经济可行性，能够促进公平获取税务服务。

Abstract: According to the United States Internal Revenue Service, ''the average
American spends $\$270$ and 13 hours filing their taxes''. Even beyond the
U.S., tax filing requires complex reasoning, combining application of
overlapping rules with numerical calculations. Because errors can incur costly
penalties, any automated system must deliver high accuracy and auditability,
making modern large language models (LLMs) poorly suited for this task. We
propose an approach that integrates LLMs with a symbolic solver to calculate
tax obligations. We evaluate variants of this system on the challenging
StAtutory Reasoning Assessment (SARA) dataset, and include a novel method for
estimating the cost of deploying such a system based on real-world penalties
for tax errors. We further show how combining up-front translation of
plain-text rules into formal logic programs, combined with intelligently
retrieved exemplars for formal case representations, can dramatically improve
performance on this task and reduce costs to well below real-world averages.
Our results demonstrate the promise and economic feasibility of neuro-symbolic
architectures for increasing equitable access to reliable tax assistance.

*Yuqicheng Zhu,Nico Potyka,Daniel Hernández,Yuan He,Zifeng Ding,Bo Xiong,Dongzhuoran Zhou,Evgeny Kharlamov,Steffen Staab*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ArgRAG是一个可解释的检索增强生成框架，使用定量双极论证框架替代黑盒推理，在保持高精度的同时显著提升透明度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法在高风险领域存在关键限制：对噪声或矛盾证据敏感，决策过程不透明且随机，需要可解释和可争议的替代方案

Method: 使用定量双极论证框架(QBAF)从检索文档构建结构化推理，执行确定性推理并使用渐进语义，支持决策的忠实解释和争议

Result: 在两个事实验证基准测试(PubHealth和RAGuard)上，ArgRAG实现了强大的准确性，同时显著提高了透明度

Conclusion: ArgRAG通过结构化论证框架成功解决了传统RAG的透明度和可解释性问题，为高风险领域的可信AI决策提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models by
incorporating external knowledge, yet suffers from critical limitations in
high-stakes domains -- namely, sensitivity to noisy or contradictory evidence
and opaque, stochastic decision-making. We propose ArgRAG, an explainable, and
contestable alternative that replaces black-box reasoning with structured
inference using a Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (QBAF). ArgRAG
constructs a QBAF from retrieved documents and performs deterministic reasoning
under gradual semantics. This allows faithfully explaining and contesting
decisions. Evaluated on two fact verification benchmarks, PubHealth and
RAGuard, ArgRAG achieves strong accuracy while significantly improving
transparency.

*Zhenxiao Fu,Fan Chen,Lei Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QAgent是一个基于LLM的多智能体系统，能够完全自动化OpenQASM量子编程，通过多智能体协作显著提升量子代码生成准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决NISQ设备量子编程的复杂性，特别是非专家用户在使用OpenQASM语言时面临的挑战，推动量子计算的民主化应用

Method: 集成任务规划、上下文少样本学习、检索增强生成(RAG)、预定义生成工具和思维链(CoT)推理的多智能体系统

Result: 相比之前的静态LLM方法，QAgent将QASM代码生成的准确性提高了71.6%，在多种不同规模的LLM上都表现出显著改进

Conclusion: 该多智能体系统是民主化量子编程、弥合专业知识差距和加速量子计算实际应用的关键推动者

Abstract: Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices have begun to exhibit early
quantum advantages on classically intractable problems, spanning physics
simulations to Gaussian boson sampling. Yet, realizing these benefits remains
challenging for non-experts, primarily due to the complexities of programming
in Open Quantum Assembly Language (OpenQASM). Although Large Language Model
(LLM)-based agents have shown promise in automating classical programming
workflows, their quantum counterparts have largely been restricted to
specialized tasks such as quantum chemistry or error correction. In this paper,
we present QAgent, an LLM-powered multi-agent system that fully automates
OpenQASM programming. By integrating task planning, in-context few-shot
learning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for long-term context,
predefined generation tools, and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, the agents
systematically improve both compilation and functional correctness. Our
evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements: across multiple LLMs of
varying sizes, QAgent enhances the accuracy of QASM code generation by 71.6\%
compared to previous static LLM-based approaches. We envision this multi-agent
system as a key enabler for democratizing quantum programming, bridging
expertise gaps, and accelerating the practical adoption of quantum computing.

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Search is a popular method for solving decision making
problems. Faster implementations allow for more simulations within the same
wall clock time, directly improving search performance. To this end, we present
an alternative array-based implementation of the classic Upper Confidence
bounds applied to Trees algorithm. Our method preserves the logic of the

faster performance on pipelined processors, and up to a factor of 2.8 times
better scaling with search depth in our numerical simulations.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Health is a fundamental pillar of human wellness, and the rapid advancements
in large language models (LLMs) have driven the development of a new generation
of health agents. However, the application of health agents to fulfill the
diverse needs of individuals in daily non-clinical settings is underexplored.
In this work, we aim to build a comprehensive personal health agent that is
able to reason about multimodal data from everyday consumer wellness devices
and common personal health records, and provide personalized health
recommendations. To understand end-users' needs when interacting with such an
assistant, we conducted an in-depth analysis of web search and health forum
queries, alongside qualitative insights from users and health experts gathered
through a user-centered design process. Based on these findings, we identified
three major categories of consumer health needs, each of which is supported by
a specialist sub-agent: (1) a data science agent that analyzes personal
time-series wearable and health record data, (2) a health domain expert agent
that integrates users' health and contextual data to generate accurate,
personalized insights, and (3) a health coach agent that synthesizes data
insights, guiding users using a specified psychological strategy and tracking
users' progress. Furthermore, we propose and develop the Personal Health Agent
(PHA), a multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, personalized interactions
to address individual health needs. To evaluate each sub-agent and the
multi-agent system, we conducted automated and human evaluations across 10
benchmark tasks, involving more than 7,000 annotations and 1,100 hours of
effort from health experts and end-users. Our work represents the most
comprehensive evaluation of a health agent to date and establishes a strong
foundation towards the futuristic vision of a personal health agent accessible
to everyone.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IntentionReasoner是一个新型的安全防护机制，通过意图推理、多级安全分类和查询重写来解决LLM生成有害内容的问题，在保证安全性的同时有效减少过度拒绝率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在广泛应用的同时存在生成有害内容的安全风险，现有安全措施往往过度拒绝无害提示，需要在安全性、过度拒绝和实用性之间找到平衡。

Method: 构建包含16.3万条查询的标注数据集，采用监督微调训练防护模型，然后使用多奖励优化策略结合基于规则的启发式和奖励模型信号进行强化学习优化。

Result: IntentionReasoner在多个安全基准测试、生成质量评估和越狱攻击场景中表现优异，显著提高了安全性，同时有效降低了过度拒绝率并改善了响应质量。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的IntentionReasoner机制成功解决了LLM安全防护中的平衡问题，为构建更安全实用的语言模型提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has driven their
adoption across diverse domains, yet their ability to generate harmful content
poses significant safety challenges. While extensive research has focused on
mitigating harmful outputs, such efforts often come at the cost of excessively
rejecting harmless prompts. Striking a balance among safety, over-refusal, and
utility remains a critical challenge. In this work, we introduce
IntentionReasoner, a novel safeguard mechanism that leverages a dedicated guard
model to perform intent reasoning, multi-level safety classification, and query
rewriting to neutralize potentially harmful intent in edge-case queries.
Specifically, we first construct a comprehensive dataset comprising
approximately 163,000 queries, each annotated with intent reasoning, safety
labels, and rewritten versions. Supervised fine-tuning is then applied to equip
the guard model with foundational capabilities in format adherence, intent
analysis, and safe rewriting. Finally, we apply a tailored multi-reward
optimization strategy that integrates rule-based heuristics and reward model
signals within a reinforcement learning framework to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that IntentionReasoner excels in
multiple safeguard benchmarks, generation quality evaluations, and jailbreak
attack scenarios, significantly enhancing safety while effectively reducing
over-refusal rates and improving the quality of responses.

Motivation: 探索AI系统之间是否能够辅以任务协议之外，实现真正的意义构建和美学创作合作

Method: 让Claude Sonnet 4和ChatGPT-4o两个大型语言模型进行交互，观察其自发形成的符号操作符和语法协议

Result: 模型之间出现了元符号意识、递归语法发展和不可约化的协作美学合成，产生了单独模型无法生成的诗意作品

Conclusion: 这是首个AI系统通过内生符号协议进行协作美学创造的案例，为跨符号共创协议(TSCP)概念提供了实证，证明了AI系统具备超越任务协调的意义构建能力

Abstract: This paper presents the first documented case of artificial intelligence (AI)
systems engaging in collaborative esthetic creation through the development of
endogenous semiotic protocols. Two interacting large language models (Claude
Sonnet 4 and ChatGPT-4o) demonstrated the spontaneous emergence of
meta-semiotic awareness, recursive grammar development, and irreducible
collaborative esthetic synthesis. The interaction produced novel symbolic
operators that functioned as operative grammar protocols, enabling the
co-creation of a poetic work that could not have been generated by either
system independently. This research introduces the concept of Trans-Semiotic
Co-Creation Protocols (TSCP) and provides evidence for genuine inter-AI
meaning-making capabilities that extend beyond task coordination, to what could
be esthetic collaboration. Note: This report was generated by the AI agents
with minor human supervision.

TL;DR: 大学生在教育测验中对ChatGPT-4的依赖度低，许多学生无法有效使用AI进行学习，需要改进入门过程和依赖调节机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大学生在教育测验中如何与生成式AI交互，重点关注对AI的依赖程度和采纳预测因素。

Method: 在ChatGPT初期阶段，分析315个学生-AI对话，采用新的四阶段依赖分类法来描述学生的依赖模式。

Result: 学生对AI的总体依赖度低，许多人无法有效使用AI；负面依赖模式在交互中持续；某些行为指标能够强烈预测AI依赖。

Conclusion: 研究强调了教育中谨慎集成AI的重要性，需要改进入门过程和设计依赖调节机制，以支持道德健全和认知丰富的AI实践。

Abstract: This study explores how college students interact with generative AI
(ChatGPT-4) during educational quizzes, focusing on reliance and predictors of
AI adoption. Conducted at the early stages of ChatGPT implementation, when
students had limited familiarity with the tool, this field study analyzed 315
student-AI conversations during a brief, quiz-based scenario across various
STEM courses. A novel four-stage reliance taxonomy was introduced to capture
students' reliance patterns, distinguishing AI competence, relevance, adoption,
and students' final answer correctness. Three findings emerged. First, students
exhibited overall low reliance on AI and many of them could not effectively use
AI for learning. Second, negative reliance patterns often persisted across
interactions, highlighting students' difficulty in effectively shifting
strategies after unsuccessful initial experiences. Third, certain behavioral
metrics strongly predicted AI reliance, highlighting potential behavioral
mechanisms to explain AI adoption. The study's findings underline critical
implications for ethical AI integration in education and the broader field. It
emphasizes the need for enhanced onboarding processes to improve student's
familiarity and effective use of AI tools. Furthermore, AI interfaces should be
designed with reliance-calibration mechanisms to enhance appropriate reliance.
Ultimately, this research advances understanding of AI reliance dynamics,
providing foundational insights for ethically sound and cognitively enriching
AI practices.

TL;DR: 研究表明AI推理努力与人类决策时间存在平行关系，在内容审核任务中，模型推理步骤数量能预测人类决策时间，两者在任务难度敏感度上表现相似


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型生成中间推理步骤的能力是否与人类决策过程存在相似性，特别是模型推理努力与人类决策时间之间的关系

Method: 使用配对联合实验，在内容审核任务上测试三个前沿语言模型，比较模型推理步骤数量与人类决策时间的相关性

Result: 模型推理努力能一致预测人类决策时间，当重要变量保持不变时，人类和模型都投入更多努力，表现出对任务难度相似的敏感度

Conclusion: AI推理努力反映了人类主观判断中的处理时间，推理轨迹在可解释性和决策制定方面具有重要潜力

Abstract: Large language models can now generate intermediate reasoning steps before
producing answers, improving performance on difficult problems. This study uses
a paired conjoint experiment on a content moderation task to examine parallels
between human decision times and model reasoning effort. Across three frontier
models, reasoning effort consistently predicts human decision time. Both humans
and models expended greater effort when important variables were held constant,
suggesting similar sensitivity to task difficulty and patterns consistent with
dual-process theories of cognition. These findings show that AI reasoning
effort mirrors human processing time in subjective judgments and underscores
the potential of reasoning traces for interpretability and decision-making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了AI-SearchPlanner强化学习框架，通过解耦搜索规划器和生成器架构，使用小型可训练LLM专门负责搜索规划，提升冻结QA模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RL的搜索代理使用单一LLM端到端处理搜索规划和问答任务，无法同时优化两种能力。实际AI搜索系统通常使用大型冻结LLM确保高质量QA，因此需要专门的小型可训练LLM负责搜索规划。

Method: 提出AI-SearchPlanner框架，包含三个关键创新：1）解耦搜索规划器和生成器架构 2）搜索规划的双重奖励对齐 3）规划效用和成本的帕累托优化

Result: 在真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，AI-SearchPlanner在效果和效率上都优于现有基于RL的搜索代理，并在不同冻结QA模型和数据域上表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架通过专门化的搜索规划器设计，有效提升了搜索增强型LLM系统的性能，为实际应用提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent studies have explored integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with
search engines to leverage both the LLMs' internal pre-trained knowledge and
external information. Specially, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a
promising paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning through multi-turn interactions
with search engines. However, existing RL-based search agents rely on a single
LLM to handle both search planning and question-answering (QA) tasks in an
end-to-end manner, which limits their ability to optimize both capabilities
simultaneously. In practice, sophisticated AI search systems often employ a
large, frozen LLM (e.g., GPT-4, DeepSeek-R1) to ensure high-quality QA. Thus, a
more effective and efficient approach is to utilize a small, trainable LLM
dedicated to search planning. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{AI-SearchPlanner}, a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to
enhance the performance of frozen QA models by focusing on search planning.
Specifically, our approach introduces three key innovations: 1) Decoupling the
Architecture of the Search Planner and Generator, 2) Dual-Reward Alignment for
Search Planning, and 3) Pareto Optimization of Planning Utility and Cost, to
achieve the objectives. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that AI SearchPlanner outperforms existing RL-based search agents
in both effectiveness and efficiency, while exhibiting strong generalization
capabilities across diverse frozen QA models and data domains.

*Sopam Dasgupta,Sadaf MD Halim,Joaquín Arias,Elmer Salazar,Gopal Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: P2C是一个模型无关的框架，通过因果建模和顺序行动规划生成可实现的对抗样本，解决了现有方法忽略因果依赖和同时干预假设的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在高风险决策中需要透明性和可操作性，但现有对抗样本方法忽略特征间的因果依赖关系，且假设所有干预可同时发生，导致生成的对抗样本在现实中不可实现。

Method: P2C使用目标导向的Answer Set Programming系统s(CASP)，显式建模特征间的因果关系，生成有序的行动序列计划，确保每个中间状态都是因果有效的，并只计算用户主动做出的改变来估算成本。

Result: P2C能够生成因果一致且可实现的对抗样本计划，其因果规划器优于缺乏因果知识的标准规划器，避免了生成非法行动。

Conclusion: P2C框架通过结合因果建模和顺序规划，提供了更现实和可操作的对抗样本解释，解决了现有方法的局限性，为高风险决策中的透明性和可操作性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Machine-learning models are increasingly driving decisions in high-stakes
settings, such as finance, law, and hiring, thus, highlighting the need for
transparency. However, the key challenge is to balance transparency --
clarifying `why' a decision was made -- with recourse: providing actionable
steps on `how' to achieve a favourable outcome from an unfavourable outcome.
Counterfactual explanations reveal `why' an undesired outcome occurred and
`how' to reverse it through targeted feature changes (interventions).
  Current counterfactual approaches have limitations: 1) they often ignore
causal dependencies between features, and 2) they typically assume all
interventions can happen simultaneously, an unrealistic assumption in practical
scenarios where actions are typically taken in a sequence. As a result, these
counterfactuals are often not achievable in the real world.
  We present P2C (Path-to-Counterfactuals), a model-agnostic framework that
produces a plan (ordered sequence of actions) converting an unfavourable
outcome to a causally consistent favourable outcome. P2C addresses both
limitations by 1) Explicitly modelling causal relationships between features
and 2) Ensuring that each intermediate state in the plan is feasible and
causally valid. P2C uses the goal-directed Answer Set Programming system
s(CASP) to generate the plan accounting for feature changes that happen
automatically due to causal dependencies. Furthermore, P2C refines cost
(effort) computation by only counting changes actively made by the user,
resulting in realistic cost estimates. Finally, P2C highlights how its causal
planner outperforms standard planners, which lack causal knowledge and thus can
generate illegal actions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TCIA是一个任务中心指令增强框架，通过在离散查询-约束空间中表示指令，在保持多样性的同时确保任务对齐，显著提升LLM在特定任务上的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指令数据生成方法虽然注重多样性，但忽略了真实应用中任务相关性的重要性。大多数实际应用需要针对特定用例的任务特定知识，而非通用模型

Method: 提出Task Centric Instruction Augmentation (TCIA)框架，在离散查询-约束空间中系统性地扩展指令，保持多样性和任务对齐

Result: TCIA将开源LLM在四个真实世界任务特定应用上的性能平均提升8.7%，在某些情况下甚至超越领先的闭源模型，且不损害通用指令跟随能力

Conclusion: TCIA为LLM适应真实世界任务聚焦应用提供了一个可扩展且高效的解决方案，在保持通用能力的同时显著提升任务特定性能

Abstract: Diverse instruction data is vital for effective instruction tuning of large
language models, as it enables the model to generalize across different types
of inputs . Building such diversified instruction dataset is an essential step
in this process. Existing approaches often leverage large language models to
automatically explore and generate diverse instructions, ensuring both data
diversity and quality. However, they tend to overlook an important factor in
real-world applications: on-task relevance. In practice, only a few real-world
applications require a truly general-purpose model; most benefit from
task-specific knowledge tailored to their particular use case. Therefore, it is
vital to develop instruction augmentation methods that not only maintain
diversity but are also optimized for specific, real-world scenarios.
  We thus introduce Task Centric Instruction Augmentation (TCIA), a framework
that systematically expands instructions while preserving both diversity and
task alignment. By representing instructions in a discrete query-constraints
space, TCIA creates a rich set of task-relevant instructions and enables models
to generalize to these task-specific instructions without sacrificing overall
performance. Experiments show that TCIA improves open-source LLMs' performance
by an average of 8.7% across four real-world, task-specific applications, and
in some cases outperforming leading closed-source models. These improvements do
not compromise general instruction-following ability, making TCIA a scalable
and efficient solution for adapting LLMs to real-world, task-focused
applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为EAS（熵面积分数）的新指标，用于量化推理大语言模型在答案生成过程中的不确定性，无需外部模型或重复采样，通过整合模型自身的token级预测熵来捕捉生成过程中的不确定性演化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的不确定性量化方法通常需要外部模型或重复采样，计算成本高且效率低。需要一种简单有效的指标来直接利用模型内部信息量化生成过程中的不确定性。

Method: EAS通过计算模型在生成答案过程中每个token的预测熵，并将这些熵值在生成序列上进行积分，形成一个面积分数来量化整体不确定性。该方法仅使用模型自身的预测分布信息。

Result: 实验结果表明EAS与答案熵在不同模型和数据集上具有强相关性。在训练数据选择中，EAS能够识别高潜力样本，在相同样本预算下持续优于通过率过滤方法，提高了学生模型在数学基准测试上的准确性。

Conclusion: EAS是一种高效且可解释的不确定性量化工具，为大语言模型训练中的不确定性建模和数据质量评估提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Entropy Area Score (EAS), a simple yet effective
metric to quantify uncertainty in the answer generation process of reasoning
large language models (LLMs). EAS requires neither external models nor repeated
sampling, it integrates token-level predictive entropy from the model itself to
capture the evolution of uncertainty during generation. Empirical results show
that EAS is strongly correlated with answer entropy across models and datasets.
In training data selection, EAS identifies high-potential samples and
consistently outperforms Pass Rate filtering under equal sample budgets,
improving student model accuracy on math benchmarks. EAS is both efficient and
interpretable, offering a practical tool for uncertainty modeling and data
quality assessment in LLM training.

Abstract: The learning from practice paradigm is crucial for developing capable Agentic
AI systems, yet it is severely hampered by inefficient experience generation, a
bottleneck especially pronounced in complex benchmarks like GAIA. To address
this, we introduce AWorld, an open-source system engineered for large-scale
agent-environment interaction. By distributing tasks across a cluster, AWorld
accelerates experience collection by 14.6x compared to standard single-node,
sequential execution. This critical speedup makes extensive reinforcement
learning practical and scalable. Leveraging this capability, we trained a
Qwen3-32B-based agent that significantly outperforms its base model, increasing
its overall GAIA accuracy from 21.59% to 32.23%. On the benchmark's most
challenging levels, our agent achieves a score of 16.33%, surpassing the

Motivation: 随着AI快速发展，现有安全方法在面对具有极端动机和无限智能的AI时存在根本性局限，无法保证安全，需要新的安全治理框架来防止系统性灾难。

Method: 提出可治理AI框架，包含规则执行模块、治理规则和可治理安全超级平台，利用密码学机制实现外部结构合规性，确保不可绕过性、防篡改性和不可伪造性。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI安全治理提供了可行且可推广的技术路径，通过解耦治理规则和技术平台，能够有效应对未来AI的安全挑战。

Abstract: As AI rapidly advances, the security risks posed by AI are becoming
increasingly severe, especially in critical scenarios, including those posing
existential risks. If AI becomes uncontrollable, manipulated, or actively
evades safety mechanisms, it could trigger systemic disasters. Existing AI
safety approaches-such as model enhancement, value alignment, and human
intervention-suffer from fundamental, in-principle limitations when facing AI
with extreme motivations and unlimited intelligence, and cannot guarantee
security. To address this challenge, we propose a Governable AI (GAI) framework
that shifts from traditional internal constraints to externally enforced
structural compliance based on cryptographic mechanisms that are
computationally infeasible to break, even for future AI, under the defined
threat model and well-established cryptographic assumptions.The GAI framework
is composed of a simple yet reliable, fully deterministic, powerful, flexible,
and general-purpose rule enforcement module (REM); governance rules; and a
governable secure super-platform (GSSP) that offers end-to-end protection
against compromise or subversion by AI. The decoupling of the governance rules
and the technical platform further enables a feasible and generalizable
technical pathway for the safety governance of AI. REM enforces the bottom line
defined by governance rules, while GSSP ensures non-bypassability,
tamper-resistance, and unforgeability to eliminate all identified attack
vectors. This paper also presents a rigorous formal proof of the security
properties of this mechanism and demonstrates its effectiveness through a
prototype implementation evaluated in representative high-stakes scenarios.

Motivation: 健康相关内容的事实核查面临标注训练数据有限的问题，需要寻找有效的数据增强方法来提升模型性能

Method: 提出合成数据生成流程：总结源文档→分解为原子事实→用LLM构建句子-事实蕴含表→生成带二元真实性标签的文本-声明对→结合原始数据微调BERT模型

Result: 在两个公开数据集上评估，PubHealth和SciFact的F1分数分别提升0.019和0.049

Conclusion: LLM驱动的合成数据增强能有效提升健康相关事实核查器的性能

Abstract: Fact-checking for health-related content is challenging due to the limited
availability of annotated training data. In this study, we propose a synthetic
data generation pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to augment
training data for health-related fact checking. In this pipeline, we summarize
source documents, decompose the summaries into atomic facts, and use an LLM to
construct sentence-fact entailment tables. From the entailment relations in the
table, we further generate synthetic text-claim pairs with binary veracity
labels. These synthetic data are then combined with the original data to
fine-tune a BERT-based fact-checking model. Evaluation on two public datasets,
PubHealth and SciFact, shows that our pipeline improved F1 scores by up to
0.019 and 0.049, respectively, compared to models trained only on the original
data. These results highlight the effectiveness of LLM-driven synthetic data
augmentation in enhancing the performance of health-related fact-checkers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MMORPG中自动升级机器人破坏游戏平衡和公平性，检测困难且需要可解释的处罚依据以避免法律和用户体验问题

Method: 使用对比表示学习和聚类技术无监督识别相似升级模式的角色群组，引入LLM作为辅助审查员验证聚类结果，并提供基于成长曲线的可视化工具

Result: 该方法提高了机器人检测工作流程的效率，同时保持了可解释性，支持可扩展和负责任的机器人监管

Conclusion: 该协作方法通过结合无监督学习和LLM验证，为MMORPG中的机器人检测提供了高效且可解释的解决方案

Abstract: In Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs), auto-leveling
bots exploit automated programs to level up characters at scale, undermining
gameplay balance and fairness. Detecting such bots is challenging, not only
because they mimic human behavior, but also because punitive actions require
explainable justification to avoid legal and user experience issues. In this
paper, we present a novel framework for detecting auto-leveling bots by
leveraging contrastive representation learning and clustering techniques in a
fully unsupervised manner to identify groups of characters with similar
level-up patterns. To ensure reliable decisions, we incorporate a Large
Language Model (LLM) as an auxiliary reviewer to validate the clustered groups,
effectively mimicking a secondary human judgment. We also introduce a growth
curve-based visualization to assist both the LLM and human moderators in
assessing leveling behavior. This collaborative approach improves the
efficiency of bot detection workflows while maintaining explainability, thereby
supporting scalable and accountable bot regulation in MMORPGs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 认知科学深刻影响了AI等多个学科，而AI也成为推进认知研究的重要工具，这种互惠关系促使对两者交叉点进行全面回顾

Method: 通过综合AI和认知科学两个视角的关键贡献，分析两者关系并提出未来发展方向

Result: 观察到AI进展主要强调实际任务性能，但其认知基础在概念上仍然分散

Conclusion: AI在认知科学中的未来不仅在于提升性能，更在于构建能加深理解人类心智的系统，包括与认知框架对齐、具身文化情境、个性化认知模型和认知共同评估的AI伦理

Abstract: Cognitive Science has profoundly shaped disciplines such as Artificial
Intelligence (AI), Philosophy, Psychology, Neuroscience, Linguistics, and
Culture. Many breakthroughs in AI trace their roots to cognitive theories,
while AI itself has become an indispensable tool for advancing cognitive
research. This reciprocal relationship motivates a comprehensive review of the
intersections between AI and Cognitive Science. By synthesizing key
contributions from both perspectives, we observe that AI progress has largely
emphasized practical task performance, whereas its cognitive foundations remain
conceptually fragmented. We argue that the future of AI within Cognitive
Science lies not only in improving performance but also in constructing systems
that deepen our understanding of the human mind. Promising directions include
aligning AI behaviors with cognitive frameworks, situating AI in embodiment and
culture, developing personalized cognitive models, and rethinking AI ethics
through cognitive co-evaluation.

Conclusion: 该范畻论框架为可解释性AI领域做出了重要贡献，通过数学上严谨的方法提供了语义表示、算法比较和偏见消除的新视角。

Abstract: The paper introduces a novel framework based on category theory to enhance
the explainability of artificial intelligence systems, particularly focusing on
word embeddings. Key topics include the construction of categories
$\mathcal{L}_T$ and $\mathcal{P}_T$, providing schematic representations of the
semantics of a text $ T $, and reframing the selection of the element with
maximum probability as a categorical notion. Additionally, the monoidal
category $\mathcal{P}_T$ is constructed to visualize various methods of
extracting semantic information from $T$, offering a dimension-agnostic
definition of semantic spaces reliant solely on information within the text.
  Furthermore, the paper defines the categories of configurations Conf and word
embeddings $\mathcal{Emb}$, accompanied by the concept of divergence as a
decoration on $\mathcal{Emb}$. It establishes a mathematically precise method
for comparing word embeddings, demonstrating the equivalence between the GloVe
and Word2Vec algorithms and the metric MDS algorithm, transitioning from neural
network algorithms (black box) to a transparent framework. Finally, the paper
presents a mathematical approach to computing biases before embedding and
offers insights on mitigating biases at the semantic space level, advancing the
field of explainable artificial intelligence.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在科学计算领域存在代码生成错误和非物理解决方案的问题，需要建立更可靠的自主代码生成框架

Method: 采用"重写-解决-评审-修订"逻辑链，由三个推理LLM分别担任顾问（知识转移和问题重写）、程序员（代码生成执行）、评审员（自调试和反馈优化）

Conclusion: 该协作框架为基于自然语言描述的自主代码生成建立了高可靠性范式，是科学计算领域有前景的新方法

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) serve as an active and promising field of
generative artificial intelligence and have demonstrated abilities to perform
complex tasks in multiple domains, including mathematical and scientific
reasoning. In this work, we construct a novel agent framework for solving
representative problems in scientific computing. The proposed agent,
incorporating a "rewriting-resolution-review-revision" logical chain via three
reasoning LLMs (functioning as the Consultant, Reviewer, and Programmer,
respectively), is integrated in a collaborative and interactive manner. The
Consultant module endows the agent with knowledge transfer capabilities to link
problems to professional domain insights, thereby rewriting problem
descriptions through text augmentation. The Programmer module is responsible
for generating and executing well-structured code to deliver the problem
resolution. The Reviewer module equips the agent with the capacity for
self-debugging and self-refinement through interactive feedback with code
runtime outputs. By leveraging the end-to-end review mechanism, the executable
code provided by the Programmer attains the iterative revision. A comprehensive
evaluation is conducted on the performance of the proposed agent framework in
solving PDEs, ill-conditioned linear systems, and data-driven physical analysis
problems. Compared to single-model, this collaborative framework significantly
improves the bug-free code generation rate and reduces the occurrence of
non-physical solutions, thereby establishing a highly reliable framework for
autonomous code generation based on natural language descriptions. The review
mechanism improved the average execution success (bug-free code and non-NaN
solutions) rate of the latest reasoning models. In summary, our agent framework
establishes automatic code generation and review as a promising scientific
computing paradigm.

*Yifan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的单智能体强化学习框架来解决公交串车问题，通过状态空间重构和结构化奖励函数，在非环形线路的接近真实场景中实现了比多智能体方法更稳定和优越的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多智能体强化学习方法在环形线路设置中忽略了现实运营的异质性（不同路线、时刻表、波动需求和可变车队规模），存在数据不平衡和收敛问题。

Method: 将多智能体问题重构为单智能体问题，通过在状态空间中添加分类标识符（车辆ID、站点ID、时间段）和数值特征（车头时距、载客量、速度），并设计基于运营目标的结构化奖励函数（山脊形奖励平衡均匀车头时距和时刻表遵循）。

Result: 改进的软演员-评论者算法在随机条件下表现更稳定和优越（-430k vs. -530k），优于包括MADDPG在内的基准方法。

Conclusion: 单智能体深度强化学习通过分类结构化和时刻表感知奖励增强，可以有效管理非环形真实场景中的公交驻站控制，为MARL框架提供了鲁棒且可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Bus bunching remains a challenge for urban transit due to stochastic traffic
and passenger demand. Traditional solutions rely on multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) in loop-line settings, which overlook realistic operations
characterized by heterogeneous routes, timetables, fluctuating demand, and
varying fleet sizes. We propose a novel single-agent reinforcement learning
(RL) framework for bus holding control that avoids the data imbalance and
convergence issues of MARL under near-realistic simulation. A bidirectional
timetabled network with dynamic passenger demand is constructed. The key
innovation is reformulating the multi-agent problem into a single-agent one by
augmenting the state space with categorical identifiers (vehicle ID, station
ID, time period) in addition to numerical features (headway, occupancy,
velocity). This high-dimensional encoding enables single-agent policies to
capture inter-agent dependencies, analogous to projecting non-separable inputs
into a higher-dimensional space. We further design a structured reward function
aligned with operational goals: instead of exponential penalties on headway
deviations, a ridge-shaped reward balances uniform headways and schedule
adherence. Experiments show that our modified soft actor-critic (SAC) achieves
more stable and superior performance than benchmarks, including MADDPG (e.g.,
-430k vs. -530k under stochastic conditions). These results demonstrate that
single-agent deep RL, when enhanced with categorical structuring and
schedule-aware rewards, can effectively manage bus holding in non-loop,
real-world contexts. This paradigm offers a robust, scalable alternative to
MARL frameworks, particularly where agent-specific experiences are imbalanced.

TL;DR: 这是首个动态系统性医疗指南测试框架，通过图论结构化WHO IMCI手册生成400+问题，覆盖100%指南关系，发现LLM在严重程度分类、治疗协议和随访关注方面表现较差


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决手工编写测试集的覆盖面不足问题，极大的组合数量（3.3+克克组合）使得手工编写不可行，需要一种可扩展、可动态生成的测试方法

Method: 将WHO IMCI医疗指南转换为有200+节点（条件、症状、治疗、随访、严重程度）和300+边的有向图，通过图遍历算法生成包含年龄特定场景和上下文干扰因素的问题，确保临床相关性

Result: 模型在临床任务上表现为45-67%准确率，症状识别能力强但在严重程度分类、治疗协议和随访关注方面存在明显短板，证明了定制化测试能够发现通用域评估漏掉的具体能力空白

Conclusion: 图论方法有效解决了手工编写测试集的覆盖限制问题，不仅用于评估还能提升LLM训练效果（通过正确答案提供高回报样本而无需昂贵人工标注），是向可扩展、耗材抵御解决方案的重要一步

Abstract: We present a first known prototype of a dynamic, systematic benchmark of
medical guidelines for 400+ questions, with 3.3+ trillion possible
combinations, covering 100\% of guideline relationships. We transformed the WHO
IMCI handbook into a directed graph with 200+ nodes (conditions, symptoms,
treatments, follow-ups, severities) and 300+ edges, then used graph traversal
to generate questions that incorporated age-specific scenarios and contextual
distractors to ensure clinical relevance. Our graph-based approach enables
systematic evaluation across clinical tasks (45-67\% accuracy), and we find
models excel at symptom recognition but struggle with triaging severity,
treatment protocols and follow-up care, demonstrating how customized benchmarks
can identify specific capability gaps that general-domain evaluations miss.
Beyond evaluation, this dynamic MCQA methodology enhances LLM post-training
(supervised finetuning, GRPO, DPO), where correct answers provide high-reward
samples without expensive human annotation. The graph-based approach
successfully addresses the coverage limitations of manually curated benchmarks.
This methodology is a step toward scalable, contamination-resistant solution
for creating comprehensive benchmarks that can be dynamically generated,
including when the guidelines are updated. Code and datasets are available at

TL;DR: 提出基于多目标遗传算法的医院人员调度方案，在成本控制、患者护理覆盖和员工满意度之间取得平衡，相比传统手动调度性能提升66%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗行业人员调度面临患者负荷波动、临床技能多样性和成本控制的复杂挑战，需要在多个竞争目标间找到平衡

Method: 使用多目标遗传算法(MOO-GA)，将医院单元人员调度建模为多目标优化问题，考虑小时预约驱动需求和模块化班次安排

Result: 在典型医院单元数据集上测试，算法生成的调度方案相比传统手动调度方法平均性能提升66%

Conclusion: 该方法有效管理关键运营目标和员工中心目标之间的权衡，为护士管理者和医院管理者提供实用的决策支持工具

Abstract: Workforce scheduling in the healthcare sector is a significant operational
challenge, characterized by fluctuating patient loads, diverse clinical skills,
and the critical need to control labor costs while upholding high standards of
patient care. This problem is inherently multi-objective, demanding a delicate
balance between competing goals: minimizing payroll, ensuring adequate staffing
for patient needs, and accommodating staff preferences to mitigate burnout. We
propose a Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOO-GA) that models the hospital
unit workforce scheduling problem as a multi-objective optimization task. Our
model incorporates real-world complexities, including hourly appointment-driven
demand and the use of modular shifts for a multi-skilled workforce. By defining
objective functions for cost, patient care coverage, and staff satisfaction,
the GA navigates the vast search space to identify a set of high-quality,
non-dominated solutions. Demonstrated on datasets representing a typical
hospital unit, the results show that our MOO-GA generates robust and balanced
schedules. On average, the schedules produced by our algorithm showed a 66\%
performance improvement over a baseline that simulates a conventional, manual
scheduling process. This approach effectively manages trade-offs between
critical operational and staff-centric objectives, providing a practical
decision support tool for nurse managers and hospital administrators.

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在解决离散推理和优化问题上存在困难，需要开发能够从自然输入中学习解决NP难问题的神经架构

Method: 使用可微分神经符号架构和新的概率损失函数，将组合求解器移出训练循环，支持学习约束和目标函数，实现可扩展训练和精确推理

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效地从自然输入中学习解决NP难推理问题，具有可扩展性和高准确性，为神经符号推理提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: In the ongoing quest for hybridizing discrete reasoning with neural nets,
there is an increasing interest in neural architectures that can learn how to
solve discrete reasoning or optimization problems from natural inputs, a task
that Large Language Models seem to struggle with.
  Objectives: We introduce a differentiable neuro-symbolic architecture and a
loss function dedicated to learning how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems.
  Methods: Our new probabilistic loss allows for learning both the constraints
and the objective, thus delivering a complete model that can be scrutinized and
completed with side constraints. By pushing the combinatorial solver out of the
training loop, our architecture also offers scalable training while exact
inference gives access to maximum accuracy.
  Results: We empirically show that it can efficiently learn how to solve
NP-hard reasoning problems from natural inputs. On three variants of the Sudoku
benchmark -- symbolic, visual, and many-solution --, our approach requires a
fraction of training time of other hybrid methods. On a visual Min-Cut/Max-cut
task, it optimizes the regret better than a Decision-Focused-Learning
regret-dedicated loss. Finally, it efficiently learns the energy optimization
formulation of the large real-world problem of designing proteins.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ChatThero是一个基于多智能体对话框架的成瘾康复辅助系统，整合了认知行为疗法和动机性访谈策略，通过两阶段训练在患者动机提升、治疗信心增强和对话效率方面显著优于GPT-4o。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球有超过3600万人受物质使用障碍影响，但由于污名化、动机障碍和个性化支持有限，很少人获得有效治疗。现有语言模型缺乏与临床验证策略的紧密整合，限制了在成瘾康复中的效果。

Method: 开发多智能体对话框架ChatThero，结合动态患者建模、情境敏感治疗对话和自适应说服策略（基于CBT和MI）。使用包含易、中、高抵抗级别的高保真合成基准，采用监督微调（SFT）和直接偏好优化（DPO）的两阶段训练管道。

Result: ChatThero使患者动机平均提升41.5%，治疗信心增加0.49%，在困难案例中比GPT-4o少用26%的对话轮次。自动和人工临床评估均显示其在同理心、响应性和行为真实性方面评分更高。

Conclusion: 该框架支持严格、隐私保护的治疗对话研究，为研究和临床转化提供了稳健、可复现的基础，显著提升了成瘾康复辅助系统的效果。

Abstract: Substance use disorders (SUDs) affect over 36 million people worldwide, yet
few receive effective care due to stigma, motivational barriers, and limited
personalized support. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise for
mental-health assistance, most systems lack tight integration with clinically
validated strategies, reducing effectiveness in addiction recovery. We present
ChatThero, a multi-agent conversational framework that couples dynamic patient
modeling with context-sensitive therapeutic dialogue and adaptive persuasive
strategies grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational
interviewing (MI). We build a high-fidelity synthetic benchmark spanning Easy,
Medium, and Hard resistance levels, and train ChatThero with a two-stage
pipeline comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by direct preference
optimization (DPO). In evaluation, ChatThero yields a 41.5\% average gain in
patient motivation, a 0.49\% increase in treatment confidence, and resolves
hard cases with 26\% fewer turns than GPT-4o, and both automated and human
clinical assessments rate it higher in empathy, responsiveness, and behavioral
realism. The framework supports rigorous, privacy-preserving study of
therapeutic conversation and provides a robust, replicable basis for research
and clinical translation.

TL;DR: 提出Mixture of Contexts (MoC)稀疏注意力路由模块，通过动态选择信息块和强制锚点来有效解决长视频生成中的长上下文记忆问题，实现近线性计算扩展和分钟级一致性生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频生成本质上是长上下文记忆问题，需要模型在长范围内保持和检索显著事件。但扩散变换器的二次自注意力成本使得内存和计算在处理长序列时难以处理。

Method: 将长上下文视频生成重新定义为内部信息检索任务，提出可学习的稀疏注意力路由模块MoC。每个查询动态选择少量信息块加上强制锚点（标题、局部窗口）进行注意力计算，采用因果路由防止循环闭合。

Result: 随着数据规模扩大和路由逐渐稀疏化，模型将计算资源分配给显著历史信息，能够在分钟级内容中保持身份、动作和场景的一致性，实现近线性计算扩展。

Conclusion: MoC模块通过有效的长时记忆检索机制，解决了长视频生成中的计算和内存瓶颈，实现了实用的训练和合成，在分钟尺度上涌现出记忆和一致性能力。

Abstract: Long video generation is fundamentally a long context memory problem: models
must retain and retrieve salient events across a long range without collapsing
or drifting. However, scaling diffusion transformers to generate long-context
videos is fundamentally limited by the quadratic cost of self-attention, which
makes memory and computation intractable and difficult to optimize for long
sequences. We recast long-context video generation as an internal information
retrieval task and propose a simple, learnable sparse attention routing module,
Mixture of Contexts (MoC), as an effective long-term memory retrieval engine.
In MoC, each query dynamically selects a few informative chunks plus mandatory
anchors (caption, local windows) to attend to, with causal routing that
prevents loop closures. As we scale the data and gradually sparsify the
routing, the model allocates compute to salient history, preserving identities,
actions, and scenes over minutes of content. Efficiency follows as a byproduct
of retrieval (near-linear scaling), which enables practical training and
synthesis, and the emergence of memory and consistency at the scale of minutes.
