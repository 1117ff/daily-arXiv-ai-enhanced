### [1] [Towards High-Precision Depth Sensing via Monocular-Aided iToF and RGB Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16579)
*Yansong Du,Yutong Deng,Yuting Zhou,Feiyu Jiao,Jian Song,Xun Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种iToF-RGB融合框架，通过几何校准和双编码器网络解决iToF深度传感的低分辨率、窄视场和结构失真问题，实现深度超分辨率和视场扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 间接飞行时间(iToF)深度传感存在空间分辨率低、视场角有限以及在复杂场景中结构失真的固有局限性，需要与RGB图像融合来提升性能。

Method: 首先通过精确几何校准将窄视场iToF深度图重投影到宽视场RGB坐标系，然后使用双编码器融合网络联合提取iToF深度和RGB特征，在单目深度先验指导下恢复精细结构细节并进行深度超分辨率。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在准确性、结构一致性和视觉质量方面显著优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该融合框架通过整合跨模态结构线索和深度一致性约束，实现了增强的深度精度、改进的边缘锐度和无缝视场扩展。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel iToF-RGB fusion framework designed to address the
inherent limitations of indirect Time-of-Flight (iToF) depth sensing, such as
low spatial resolution, limited field-of-view (FoV), and structural distortion
in complex scenes. The proposed method first reprojects the narrow-FoV iToF
depth map onto the wide-FoV RGB coordinate system through a precise geometric
calibration and alignment module, ensuring pixel-level correspondence between
modalities. A dual-encoder fusion network is then employed to jointly extract
complementary features from the reprojected iToF depth and RGB image, guided by
monocular depth priors to recover fine-grained structural details and perform
depth super-resolution. By integrating cross-modal structural cues and depth
consistency constraints, our approach achieves enhanced depth accuracy,
improved edge sharpness, and seamless FoV expansion. Extensive experiments on
both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy,
structural consistency, and visual quality.

### [2] [CountLoop: Training-Free High-Instance Image Generation via Iterative Agent Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16644)
*Anindya Mondal,Ayan Banerjee,Sauradip Nag,Josep Lladós,Xiatian Zhu,Anjan Dutta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CountLoop是一个无需训练的训练框架，通过迭代结构化反馈为扩散模型提供精确的实例控制，在复杂高密度场景中实现高达98%的计数准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成具有精确对象实例数量的场景时不可靠，特别是在复杂高密度设置中，需要解决实例计数控制问题

Method: 采用图像生成和多模态代理评估交替的方法，通过语言引导的规划器和批评器评估对象计数、空间布局和属性一致性，使用实例驱动的注意力掩码和组合生成技术

Result: 在COCO Count、T2I CompBench和两个新高实例基准测试中达到98%的计数准确率，空间保真度和视觉质量保持良好，得分0.97超越基线方法

Conclusion: CountLoop通过迭代反馈机制有效解决了扩散模型在实例计数控制方面的局限性，为精确场景生成提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable progress in photorealistic image
synthesis, yet they remain unreliable for generating scenes with a precise
number of object instances, particularly in complex and high-density settings.
We present CountLoop, a training-free framework that provides diffusion models
with accurate instance control through iterative structured feedback. The
approach alternates between image generation and multimodal agent evaluation,
where a language-guided planner and critic assess object counts, spatial
arrangements, and attribute consistency. This feedback is then used to refine
layouts and guide subsequent generations. To further improve separation between
objects, especially in occluded scenes, we introduce instance-driven attention
masking and compositional generation techniques. Experiments on COCO Count, T2I
CompBench, and two new high-instance benchmarks show that CountLoop achieves
counting accuracy of up to 98% while maintaining spatial fidelity and visual
quality, outperforming layout-based and gradient-guided baselines with a score
of 0.97.

### [3] [Do VLMs Have Bad Eyes? Diagnosing Compositional Failures via Mechanistic Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16652)
*Ashwath Vaithinathan Aravindan,Abha Jha,Mihir Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现CLIP视觉编码器中MLP层的神经元存在特征叠加现象，这直接阻碍了组合特征表示能力，导致视觉语言模型在组合推理和对象绑定方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在图像描述和视觉问答等任务中表现出色，但在组合泛化和对象绑定方面存在困难，限制了处理新对象属性组合的能力。

Method: 使用机制可解释性技术分析CLIP视觉编码器，发现MLP层中单个神经元代表多个特征的叠加现象。

Result: 特征叠加直接阻碍了组合特征表示，影响了组合推理和对象绑定能力。

Conclusion: 这项研究为揭示视觉语言模型中组合失败机制根源迈出了第一步，相关代码和结果已开源。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
integrating visual and textual information for tasks such as image captioning
and visual question answering. However, these models struggle with
compositional generalization and object binding, which limit their ability to
handle novel combinations of objects and their attributes. Our work explores
the root causes of these failures using mechanistic interpretability
techniques. We show evidence that individual neurons in the MLP layers of
CLIP's vision encoder represent multiple features, and this "superposition"
directly hinders its compositional feature representation which consequently
affects compositional reasoning and object binding capabilities. We hope this
study will serve as an initial step toward uncovering the mechanistic roots of
compositional failures in VLMs. The code and supporting results can be found

### [4] [MSNav: Zero-Shot Vision-and-Language Navigation with Dynamic Memory and LLM Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16654)
*Chenghao Liu,Zhimu Zhou,Jiachen Zhang,Minghao Zhang,Songfang Huang,Huiling Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSNav是一个新的视觉语言导航框架，通过集成记忆、空间和决策三个模块，解决了现有LLM方法在空间推理、跨模态对齐和长时记忆方面的缺陷，在R2R和REVERIE数据集上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于单一LLM的视觉语言导航方法存在空间推理能力弱、跨模态对齐差、长时任务内存过载等关键缺陷，需要系统性地解决这些问题。

Method: 提出MSNav框架，包含三个协同模块：1）记忆模块-动态地图记忆，通过选择性节点剪枝处理内存过载；2）空间模块-空间推理和物体关系推断，基于新构建的I-O-S数据集微调Qwen3-4B模型为Qwen-Sp；3）决策模块-基于LLM的路径规划执行稳健动作。

Result: 在I-O-S测试集上，Qwen-Sp在物体列表提取方面优于领先的商业LLM，获得更高的F1和NDCG分数。在R2R和REVERIE数据集上的大量实验显示，MSNav在成功率和路径长度加权成功率方面都有显著提升，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MSNav通过模块化架构将脆弱的推理转变为稳健的集成智能，有效解决了视觉语言导航中的关键挑战，为复杂环境中的导航任务提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to interpret natural
language instructions and navigate complex environments. Current approaches
often adopt a "black-box" paradigm, where a single Large Language Model (LLM)
makes end-to-end decisions. However, it is plagued by critical vulnerabilities,
including poor spatial reasoning, weak cross-modal grounding, and memory
overload in long-horizon tasks. To systematically address these issues, we
propose Memory Spatial Navigation(MSNav), a framework that fuses three modules
into a synergistic architecture, which transforms fragile inference into a
robust, integrated intelligence. MSNav integrates three modules: Memory Module,
a dynamic map memory module that tackles memory overload through selective node
pruning, enhancing long-range exploration; Spatial Module, a module for spatial
reasoning and object relationship inference that improves endpoint recognition;
and Decision Module, a module using LLM-based path planning to execute robust
actions. Powering Spatial Module, we also introduce an Instruction-Object-Space
(I-O-S) dataset and fine-tune the Qwen3-4B model into Qwen-Spatial (Qwen-Sp),
which outperforms leading commercial LLMs in object list extraction, achieving
higher F1 and NDCG scores on the I-O-S test set. Extensive experiments on the
Room-to-Room (R2R) and REVERIE datasets demonstrate MSNav's state-of-the-art
performance with significant improvements in Success Rate (SR) and Success
weighted by Path Length (SPL).

Abstract: Classifying soil images contributes to better land management, increased
agricultural output, and practical solutions for environmental issues. The
development of various disciplines, particularly agriculture, civil
engineering, and natural resource management, is aided by understanding of soil
quality since it helps with risk reduction, performance improvement, and sound
decision-making . Artificial intelligence has recently been used in a number of
different fields. In this study, an intelligent model was constructed using
Convolutional Neural Networks to classify soil kinds, and machine learning
algorithms were used to enhance the performance of soil classification . To
achieve better implementation and performance of the Convolutional Neural
Networks algorithm and obtain valuable results for the process of classifying
soil type images, swarm algorithms were employed to obtain the best performance
by choosing Hyper parameters for the Convolutional Neural Networks network
using the Whale optimization algorithm and the Particle swarm optimization
algorithm, and comparing the results of using the two algorithms in the process
of multiple classification of soil types. The Accuracy and F1 measures were
adopted to test the system, and the results of the proposed work were efficient

### [6] [QA-VLM: Providing human-interpretable quality assessment for wire-feed laser additive manufacturing parts with Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16661)
*Qiaojie Zheng,Jiucai Zhang,Joy Gockel,Michael B. Wakin,Craig Brice,Xiaoli Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于VLM的解释性质量评估框架QA-VLM，通过注意机制和领域知识提升增材制造质量评估的可信过性和一致性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统深度学习方法在增材制造质量评估中的黑盒问题，提供可解释的质量判断以提升信任度和实际应用

Method: 构建QA-VLM框架，结合视觉-语言模型的注意机制和推理能力，并涵盖来自同行审论文的应用特定知识

Result: 在24个单珍样品上评估，QA-VLM在解释质量的有效性和一致性方面都超过商用VLM，显示更高的可信度

Conclusion: 该框架为增材制造领域提供了可信、可解释的质量评估方案，有力推动智能化质量控制的实际应用

Abstract: Image-based quality assessment (QA) in additive manufacturing (AM) often
relies heavily on the expertise and constant attention of skilled human
operators. While machine learning and deep learning methods have been
introduced to assist in this task, they typically provide black-box outputs
without interpretable justifications, limiting their trust and adoption in
real-world settings. In this work, we introduce a novel QA-VLM framework that
leverages the attention mechanisms and reasoning capabilities of
vision-language models (VLMs), enriched with application-specific knowledge
distilled from peer-reviewed journal articles, to generate human-interpretable
quality assessments. Evaluated on 24 single-bead samples produced by laser wire
direct energy deposition (DED-LW), our framework demonstrates higher validity
and consistency in explanation quality than off-the-shelf VLMs. These results
highlight the potential of our approach to enable trustworthy, interpretable
quality assessment in AM applications.

### [7] [The Loupe: A Plug-and-Play Attention Module for Amplifying Discriminative Features in Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16663)
*Naren Sengodan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出The Loupe轻量级注意力模块，插入预训练Transformer中，无需部件标注即可引导模型关注判别性区域，在提升精度的同时提供可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细粒度视觉分类需要识别细微局部特征，但现有Vision Transformer缺乏可解释性，在生物多样性监测和医疗诊断等关键应用中难以获得信任

Method: 设计可插入预训练骨干网络（如Swin Transformer）的轻量级注意力模块，使用复合损失函数进行端到端训练，无需部件级标注即可隐式引导模型关注判别性区域

Result: 在CUB-200-2011数据集上，将Swin-Base模型准确率从85.40%提升至88.06%（提升2.66%），注意力图能有效定位语义有意义的特征

Conclusion: 简单的内在注意力机制可作为强大正则化器，显著提升性能的同时提供清晰的可视化解释，为理解和信任模型决策过程提供有价值工具

Abstract: Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) is a critical and challenging area
within computer vision, demanding the identification of highly subtle,
localized visual cues. The importance of FGVC extends to critical applications
such as biodiversity monitoring and medical diagnostics, where precision is
paramount. While large-scale Vision Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art
performance, their decision-making processes often lack the interpretability
required for trust and verification in such domains. In this paper, we
introduce The Loupe, a novel, lightweight, and plug-and-play attention module
designed to be inserted into pre-trained backbones like the Swin Transformer.
The Loupe is trained end-to-end with a composite loss function that implicitly
guides the model to focus on the most discriminative object parts without
requiring explicit part-level annotations. Our unique contribution lies in
demonstrating that a simple, intrinsic attention mechanism can act as a
powerful regularizer, significantly boosting performance while simultaneously
providing clear visual explanations. Our experimental evaluation on the
challenging CUB-200-2011 dataset shows that The Loupe improves the accuracy of
a Swin-Base model from 85.40% to 88.06%, a significant gain of 2.66%.
Crucially, our qualitative analysis of the learned attention maps reveals that
The Loupe effectively localizes semantically meaningful features, providing a
valuable tool for understanding and trusting the model's decision-making
process.

### [8] [COVID19 Prediction Based On CT Scans Of Lungs Using DenseNet Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16670)
*Deborup Sanyal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用卷积神经网络分析COVID-19患者的肺部CT扫描，预测感染严重程度，帮助医生做出治疗决策


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COVID-19大流行导致全球医疗系统崩溃，呼吸系统衰竭是主要死因。急需自动化工具辅助医生通过CT扫描快速评估病情严重程度，减少人为错误

Method: 采用卷积神经网络(CNN)模型，基于患者COVID-19阳性检测后的肺部CT扫描数据，训练模型预测感染严重程度

Result: 模型能够在一个月内根据CT扫描预测感染严重程度，区分预后良好或不良（需要插管或导致死亡）的情况

Conclusion: 基于CNN的CT扫描分析模型为COVID-19严重程度评估提供了有效的自动化工具，有助于缓解医疗资源紧张和改善患者预后

Abstract: COVID19 took the world by storm since December 2019. A highly infectious
communicable disease, COVID19 is caused by the SARSCoV2 virus. By March 2020,
the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID19 as a global pandemic. A
pandemic in the 21st century after almost 100 years was something the world was
not prepared for, which resulted in the deaths of around 1.6 million people
worldwide. The most common symptoms of COVID19 were associated with the
respiratory system and resembled a cold, flu, or pneumonia. After extensive
research, doctors and scientists concluded that the main reason for lives being
lost due to COVID19 was failure of the respiratory system. Patients were dying
gasping for breath. Top healthcare systems of the world were failing badly as
there was an acute shortage of hospital beds, oxygen cylinders, and
ventilators. Many were dying without receiving any treatment at all. The aim of
this project is to help doctors decide the severity of COVID19 by reading the
patient's Computed Tomography (CT) scans of the lungs. Computer models are less
prone to human error, and Machine Learning or Neural Network models tend to
give better accuracy as training improves over time. We have decided to use a
Convolutional Neural Network model. Given that a patient tests positive, our
model will analyze the severity of COVID19 infection within one month of the
positive test result. The severity of the infection may be promising or
unfavorable (if it leads to intubation or death), based entirely on the CT
scans in the dataset.

*Fangxin Shang,Yuan Xia,Dalu Yang,Yahui Wang,Binglin Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MedRepBench基准测试，包含1900份中文医疗报告，用于评估视觉语言模型在结构化医疗报告理解方面的性能，包括客观和主观评估协议，并通过GRPO优化提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗报告解读在医疗保健中至关重要，但目前缺乏标准化基准来评估结构化医疗报告理解的质量，特别是针对中文医疗报告。

Method: 构建包含1900份去标识化中文医疗报告的MedRepBench基准，支持端到端视觉语言模型评估；采用两种评估协议：客观评估（字段级召回率）和自动化主观评估（使用LLM作为评分代理）；设计奖励函数并应用GRPO优化中等规模VLM。

Result: 通过GRPO优化使VLM获得高达6%的召回率提升；发现OCR+LLM流水线存在布局盲区和延迟问题；证明了完全基于视觉的报告理解方法的必要性。

Conclusion: MedRepBench为医疗报告结构化理解提供了标准化评估基准，揭示了当前方法的局限性，并展示了通过强化学习优化模型性能的潜力，推动了稳健的完全基于视觉的医疗报告理解技术的发展。

Abstract: Medical report interpretation plays a crucial role in healthcare, enabling
both patient-facing explanations and effective information flow across clinical
systems. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models
(LLMs) have demonstrated general document understanding capabilities, there
remains a lack of standardized benchmarks to assess structured interpretation
quality in medical reports. We introduce MedRepBench, a comprehensive benchmark
built from 1,900 de-identified real-world Chinese medical reports spanning
diverse departments, patient demographics, and acquisition formats. The
benchmark is designed primarily to evaluate end-to-end VLMs for structured
medical report understanding. To enable controlled comparisons, we also include
a text-only evaluation setting using high-quality OCR outputs combined with
LLMs, allowing us to estimate the upper-bound performance when character
recognition errors are minimized. Our evaluation framework supports two
complementary protocols: (1) an objective evaluation measuring field-level
recall of structured clinical items, and (2) an automated subjective evaluation
using a powerful LLM as a scoring agent to assess factuality, interpretability,
and reasoning quality. Based on the objective metric, we further design a
reward function and apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve
a mid-scale VLM, achieving up to 6% recall gain. We also observe that the
OCR+LLM pipeline, despite strong performance, suffers from layout-blindness and
latency issues, motivating further progress toward robust, fully vision-based
report understanding.

*Yanbing Bai,Rui-Yang Ju,Lemeng Zhao,Junjie Hu,Jianchao Bi,Erick Mas,Shunichi Koshimura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出轻量级两阶段框架，用于无人机实时野火监测和火源检测，通过策略网络压缩冗余视频帧并改进YOLOv8模型，显著降低计算成本同时保持准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机在灾害应急响应中日益重要，但由于计算资源有限，无法独立运行大型模型进行实时视频分析，需要轻量高效的解决方案

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用策略网络识别和丢弃冗余视频片段，采用帧压缩技术和站点机制；第二阶段使用改进的YOLOv8模型定位火源

Result: 在FLAME和HMDB51数据集上验证第一阶段方法，在Fire & Smoke数据集上验证第二阶段方法，实验显示计算成本显著降低同时保持分类准确率，检测精度更高且推理时间相近

Conclusion: 该方法为无人机平台提供了有效的实时野火监测解决方案，平衡了计算效率和检测精度

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become increasingly important in
disaster emergency response by enabling real-time aerial video analysis. Due to
the limited computational resources available on UAVs, large models cannot be
run independently for real-time analysis. To overcome this challenge, we
propose a lightweight and efficient two-stage framework for real-time wildfire
monitoring and fire source detection on UAV platforms. Specifically, in Stage
1, we utilize a policy network to identify and discard redundant video clips
using frame compression techniques, thereby reducing computational costs. In
addition, we introduce a station point mechanism that leverages future frame
information within the sequential policy network to improve prediction
accuracy. In Stage 2, once the frame is classified as "fire", we employ the
improved YOLOv8 model to localize the fire source. We evaluate the Stage 1
method using the FLAME and HMDB51 datasets, and the Stage 2 method using the
Fire & Smoke dataset. Experimental results show that our method significantly
reduces computational costs while maintaining classification accuracy in Stage
1, and achieves higher detection accuracy with similar inference time in Stage
2 compared to baseline methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CellEcoNet是一个新颖的空间感知深度学习框架，通过自然语言类比分析全切片图像，将细胞视为单词、细胞邻域视为短语、组织结构视为句子，自动学习上下文相关含义来预测肺腺癌复发风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 约70%的侵袭性肺腺癌患者在术后5年内复发，现有工具无法准确识别需要辅助治疗的患者，存在未满足的临床需求。

Method: 提出CellEcoNet框架，将病理图像建模为自然语言：细胞=单词，细胞邻域=短语，组织结构=句子，通过深度学习自动学习空间相互作用和细微变化来预测复发风险。

Result: 在456个H&E染色全切片图像数据集上，CellEcoNet达到AUC 77.8%和HR 9.54，显著优于IASLC分级系统、AJCC分期和现有计算方法，在不同人口统计学和临床亚组中表现一致且公平。

Conclusion: CellEcoNet不仅提供了优越的预后预测性能，更代表了通过解码肿瘤微环境的细胞"语言"来揭示复发风险编码方式的范式转变。

Abstract: Despite surgical resection, ~70% of invasive lung adenocarcinoma (ILA)
patients recur within five years, and current tools fail to identify those
needing adjuvant therapy. To address this unmet clinical need, we introduce
CellEcoNet, a novel spatially aware deep learning framework that models whole
slide images (WSIs) through natural language analogy, defining a "language of
pathology," where cells act as words, cellular neighborhoods become phrases,
and tissue architecture forms sentences. CellEcoNet learns these
context-dependent meanings automatically, capturing how subtle variations and
spatial interactions derive recurrence risk. On a dataset of 456 H&E-stained
WSIs, CellEcoNet achieved superior predictive performance (AUC:77.8% HR:9.54),
outperforming IASLC grading system (AUC:71.4% HR:2.36), AJCC Stage (AUC:64.0%
HR:1.17) and state-of-the-art computational methods (AUCs:62.2-67.4%).
CellEcoNet demonstrated fairness and consistent performance across diverse
demographic and clinical subgroups. Beyond prognosis, CellEcoNet marks a
paradigm shift by decoding the tumor microenvironment's cellular "language" to
reveal how subtle cell variations encode recurrence risk.

TL;DR: 文本到图像生成的公平性评估方法，通过希尔阁值和CLIP分数评估公平性和效用，使用帕累托最优前沿进行模型比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成模型公平性评估方法依赖为主观的视觉检查，容易出错且难以复现，需要更系统化的评估方法。

Method: 提出使用帕累托最优前沿来评估文本到图像模型的公平性和效用，以正规化希尔阁值评估公平性，以CLIP分数评估效用。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion、Fair Diffusion、SDXL、DeCoDi和FLUX模型中评估发现，大多数默认超参数设置都是帕累托最优空间中的被主导解，容易找到更优的超参数。

Conclusion: 该方法能够系统地评估文本到图像模型的公平性和效用，并发现默认超参数设置通常不是最优解，通过调优可以同时提高公平性和效用。

Abstract: Achieving fairness in text-to-image generation demands mitigating social
biases without compromising visual fidelity, a challenge critical to
responsible AI. Current fairness evaluation procedures for text-to-image models
rely on qualitative judgment or narrow comparisons, which limit the capacity to
assess both fairness and utility in these models and prevent reproducible
assessment of debiasing methods. Existing approaches typically employ ad-hoc,
human-centered visual inspections that are both error-prone and difficult to
replicate. We propose a method for evaluating fairness and utility in
text-to-image models using Pareto-optimal frontiers across hyperparametrization
of debiasing methods. Our method allows for comparison between distinct
text-to-image models, outlining all configurations that optimize fairness for a
given utility and vice-versa. To illustrate our evaluation method, we use
Normalized Shannon Entropy and ClipScore for fairness and utility evaluation,
respectively. We assess fairness and utility in Stable Diffusion, Fair
Diffusion, SDXL, DeCoDi, and FLUX text-to-image models. Our method shows that
most default hyperparameterizations of the text-to-image model are dominated
solutions in the fairness-utility space, and it is straightforward to find
better hyperparameters.

TL;DR: WebMMU是一个多语言基准测试，评估网站视觉问答、代码编辑和设计到代码生成三个核心Web任务，揭示当前多模态大语言模型在推理、代码功能保持和多语言支持方面的局限性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试将这些Web任务分开处理，需要统一的评估框架来测试模型在复杂多步推理、精确元素定位和功能性UI理解编码方面的能力

Method: 使用专家标注的真实Web数据构建多语言基准，统一评估三个核心Web任务：网站视觉问答、代码编辑（HTML/CSS/JavaScript）和设计到代码生成

Result: 多模态大语言模型在基础信息提取方面表现良好，但在推理和定位、保持代码功能的编辑、以及支持多语言内容的层次结构保持方面存在困难

Conclusion: 当前MLLMs存在关键局限性，需要改进多模态和跨语言推理能力，以构建能够自动化多样化Web开发任务的未来Web代理

Abstract: We present WebMMU, a multilingual benchmark that evaluates three core web
tasks: (1) website visual question answering, (2) code editing involving
HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and (3) mockup-to-code generation. Unlike prior benchmarks
that treat these tasks separately, WebMMU unifies them using expert-annotated,
real-world web data to assess models' abilities in complex multi-step
reasoning, precise element grounding, and functional UI comprehension and
coding. Our evaluation shows that while multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) perform well on basic information extraction, they struggle with
reasoning and grounding, editing code to preserve functionality, and generating
design-to-code that maintains hierarchy and supports multilingual content.
These findings reveal key limitations in current MLLMs and underscore the need
for improved multimodal and cross-lingual reasoning to build future web agents
capable of automating diverse web development tasks.

Abstract: Achieving robust performance and fairness across diverse patient populations
remains a challenge in developing clinically deployable deep learning models
for diagnostic imaging. Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising
strategy to address limitations in dataset scale and diversity. We introduce
RoentGen-v2, a text-to-image diffusion model for chest radiographs that enables
fine-grained control over both radiographic findings and patient demographic
attributes, including sex, age, and race/ethnicity. RoentGen-v2 is the first
model to generate clinically plausible images with demographic conditioning,
facilitating the creation of a large, demographically balanced synthetic
dataset comprising over 565,000 images. We use this large synthetic dataset to
evaluate optimal training pipelines for downstream disease classification
models. In contrast to prior work that combines real and synthetic data
naively, we propose an improved training strategy that leverages synthetic data
for supervised pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Through
extensive evaluation on over 137,000 chest radiographs from five institutions,
we demonstrate that synthetic pretraining consistently improves model
performance, generalization to out-of-distribution settings, and fairness
across demographic subgroups. Across datasets, synthetic pretraining led to a
6.5% accuracy increase in the performance of downstream classification models,
compared to a modest 2.7% increase when naively combining real and synthetic
data. We observe this performance improvement simultaneously with the reduction
of the underdiagnosis fairness gap by 19.3%. These results highlight the
potential of synthetic imaging to advance equitable and generalizable medical
deep learning under real-world data constraints. We open source our code,
trained models, and synthetic dataset at

Conclusion: OVODA有效解决了开放词汇3D检测的挑战，同时发布了带有全面属性标注的OVAD数据集，为相关研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: 3D object detection plays a crucial role in autonomous systems, yet existing
methods are limited by closed-set assumptions and struggle to recognize novel
objects and their attributes in real-world scenarios. We propose OVODA, a novel
framework enabling both open-vocabulary 3D object and attribute detection with
no need to know the novel class anchor size. OVODA uses foundation models to
bridge the semantic gap between 3D features and texts while jointly detecting
attributes, e.g., spatial relationships, motion states, etc. To facilitate such
research direction, we propose OVAD, a new dataset that supplements existing 3D
object detection benchmarks with comprehensive attribute annotations. OVODA
incorporates several key innovations, including foundation model feature
concatenation, prompt tuning strategies, and specialized techniques for
attribute detection, including perspective-specified prompts and horizontal
flip augmentation. Our results on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets
show that under the condition of no given anchor sizes of novel classes, OVODA
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in open-vocabulary 3D object detection
while successfully recognizing object attributes. Our OVAD dataset is released
here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16904069 .

Conclusion: 该网络显著提高了大规模天文巡天中超新星检测的准确性和效率，展示了Transformer架构在天文图像分类任务中的优势

Abstract: We introduce a transformer-based neural network for the accurate
classification of real and bogus transient detections in astronomical images.
This network advances beyond the conventional convolutional neural network
(CNN) methods, widely used in image processing tasks, by adopting an
architecture better suited for detailed pixel-by-pixel comparison. The
architecture enables efficient analysis of search and template images only,
thus removing the necessity for computationally-expensive difference imaging,
while maintaining high performance. Our primary evaluation was conducted using
the autoScan dataset from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), where the network
achieved a classification accuracy of 97.4% and diminishing performance utility
for difference image as the size of the training set grew. Further experiments
with DES data confirmed that the network can operate at a similar level even
when the input images are not centered on the supernova candidate. These
findings highlight the network's effectiveness in enhancing both accuracy and
efficiency of supernova detection in large-scale astronomical surveys.

TL;DR: NinA用归一化流替代扩散模型作为VLA的动作解码器，实现单次采样，大幅提升推理速度，同时保持性能相当


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型需要多次迭代去噪步骤，推理速度慢，限制了在需要高频控制的现实场景中的实用性

Method: 用归一化流(NF)替换扩散动作解码器，通过可逆变换实现单次采样，集成到FLOWER VLA架构并在LIBERO基准上微调

Result: 在相同训练机制下，NinA性能与基于扩散的解码器相当，但推理速度显著更快

Conclusion: NinA为高效、高频的VLA控制提供了一条有前景的路径，且不牺牲性能

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have established a
two-component architecture, where a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM)
encodes visual observations and task descriptions, and an action decoder maps
these representations to continuous actions. Diffusion models have been widely
adopted as action decoders due to their ability to model complex, multimodal
action distributions. However, they require multiple iterative denoising steps
at inference time or downstream techniques to speed up sampling, limiting their
practicality in real-world settings where high-frequency control is crucial. In
this work, we present NinA (Normalizing Flows in Action), a fast and expressive
alter- native to diffusion-based decoders for VLAs. NinA replaces the diffusion
action decoder with a Normalizing Flow (NF) that enables one-shot sampling
through an invertible transformation, significantly reducing inference time. We
integrate NinA into the FLOWER VLA architecture and fine-tune on the LIBERO
benchmark. Our experiments show that NinA matches the performance of its
diffusion-based counterpart under the same training regime, while achieving
substantially faster inference. These results suggest that NinA offers a
promising path toward efficient, high-frequency VLA control without
compromising performance.

Motivation: 6G时代对大规模天线阵列和精确空间信道状态信息的需求，传统信道建模方法在空间分辨率、效率和可扩展性方面面临挑战，现有辐射场方法存在几何不准确和昂贵监督的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：第一阶段使用平面高斯作为几何基元进行密集表面对齐场景重建；第二阶段结合全结构无线电辐射和定制多视图损失准确建模无线电传播行为。

Result: 相比现有辐射场方法，RF-PGS显著提高了重建精度，降低了训练成本，能够高效表示无线信道。

Conclusion: RF-PGS为可扩展的6G空间CSI建模提供了实用解决方案，解决了传统方法和现有辐射场方法的局限性。

Abstract: In the 6G era, the demand for higher system throughput and the implementation
of emerging 6G technologies require large-scale antenna arrays and accurate
spatial channel state information (Spatial-CSI). Traditional channel modeling
approaches, such as empirical models, ray tracing, and measurement-based
methods, face challenges in spatial resolution, efficiency, and scalability.
Radiance field-based methods have emerged as promising alternatives but still
suffer from geometric inaccuracy and costly supervision. This paper proposes
RF-PGS, a novel framework that reconstructs high-fidelity radio propagation
paths from only sparse path loss spectra. By introducing Planar Gaussians as
geometry primitives with certain RF-specific optimizations, RF-PGS achieves
dense, surface-aligned scene reconstruction in the first geometry training
stage. In the subsequent Radio Frequency (RF) training stage, the proposed
fully-structured radio radiance, combined with a tailored multi-view loss,
accurately models radio propagation behavior. Compared to prior radiance field
methods, RF-PGS significantly improves reconstruction accuracy, reduces
training costs, and enables efficient representation of wireless channels,
offering a practical solution for scalable 6G Spatial-CSI modeling.

Motivation: 视网膜图像配准面临挑战：大范围同质区域和稀疏但关键的血管特征导致标准学习框架梯度信号有限，难以实现精确配准。

Method: 提出高斯基元优化(GPO)框架：1)粗对齐后提取关键点作为描述符控制节点；2)每个节点建模为可训练的高斯基元；3)使用KNN高斯插值传播位移信号；4)通过多损失函数进行端到端优化。

Conclusion: GPO通过在高梯度区域策略性锚定节点，确保鲁棒的梯度流，有效解决了纹理稀疏区域的梯度消失问题，为视网膜图像配准提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Deformable retinal image registration is notoriously difficult due to large
homogeneous regions and sparse but critical vascular features, which cause
limited gradient signals in standard learning-based frameworks. In this paper,
we introduce Gaussian Primitive Optimization (GPO), a novel iterative framework
that performs structured message passing to overcome these challenges. After an
initial coarse alignment, we extract keypoints at salient anatomical structures
(e.g., major vessels) to serve as a minimal set of descriptor-based control
nodes (DCN). Each node is modelled as a Gaussian primitive with trainable
position, displacement, and radius, thus adapting its spatial influence to
local deformation scales. A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Gaussian interpolation
then blends and propagates displacement signals from these information-rich
nodes to construct a globally coherent displacement field; focusing
interpolation on the top (K) neighbors reduces computational overhead while
preserving local detail. By strategically anchoring nodes in high-gradient
regions, GPO ensures robust gradient flow, mitigating vanishing gradient signal
in textureless areas. The framework is optimized end-to-end via a multi-term
loss that enforces both keypoint consistency and intensity alignment.
Experiments on the FIRE dataset show that GPO reduces the target registration
error from 6.2\,px to ~2.4\,px and increases the AUC at 25\,px from 0.770 to
0.938, substantially outperforming existing methods. The source code can be

Conclusion: 该研究填补了多模态情感推理领域的空白，提供了一个有效的测试标准和提升方案，对推动人机交互的自然性有重要意义。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been widely applied across
various fields due to their powerful perceptual and reasoning capabilities. In
the realm of psychology, these models hold promise for a deeper understanding
of human emotions and behaviors. However, recent research primarily focuses on
enhancing their emotion recognition abilities, leaving the substantial
potential in emotion reasoning, which is crucial for improving the naturalness
and effectiveness of human-machine interactions. Therefore, in this paper, we
introduce a multi-turn multimodal emotion understanding and reasoning (MTMEUR)
benchmark, which encompasses 1,451 video data from real-life scenarios, along
with 5,101 progressive questions. These questions cover various aspects,
including emotion recognition, potential causes of emotions, future action
prediction, etc. Besides, we propose a multi-agent framework, where each agent
specializes in a specific aspect, such as background context, character
dynamics, and event details, to improve the system's reasoning capabilities.
Furthermore, we conduct experiments with existing MLLMs and our agent-based
method on the proposed benchmark, revealing that most models face significant
challenges with this task.

Motivation: DreamBooth等个性化文本到图像模型需要微调大规模扩散主干网络，导致存储大量特定主题模型时产生显著存储开销

Method: 利用权重增量具有强低秩结构的特点，应用奇异值分解(SVD)分解权重增量，然后基于能量的秩截断策略平衡压缩效率和重建保真度

Result: 在多主题数据集上的实验表明，Delta-SVD实现了显著压缩，在CLIP分数、SSIM和FID等生成质量指标上损失可忽略不计

Conclusion: 该方法实现了可扩展和高效的个性化扩散模型部署，为需要存储和部署大规模主题定制化的实际应用提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image models such as DreamBooth require fine-tuning
large-scale diffusion backbones, resulting in significant storage overhead when
maintaining many subject-specific models. We present Delta-SVD, a post-hoc,
training-free compression method that targets the parameter weights update
induced by DreamBooth fine-tuning. Our key observation is that these delta
weights exhibit strong low-rank structure due to the sparse and localized
nature of personalization. Delta-SVD first applies Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD) to factorize the weight deltas, followed by an energy-based rank
truncation strategy to balance compression efficiency and reconstruction
fidelity. The resulting compressed models are fully plug-and-play and can be
re-constructed on-the-fly during inference. Notably, the proposed approach is
simple, efficient, and preserves the original model architecture. Experiments
on a multiple subject dataset demonstrate that Delta-SVD achieves substantial
compression with negligible loss in generation quality measured by CLIP score,
SSIM and FID. Our method enables scalable and efficient deployment of
personalized diffusion models, making it a practical solution for real-world
applications that require storing and deploying large-scale subject
customizations.

Motivation: 在社交媒体视觉内容主导的时代，理解视觉内容如何传达情感至关重要，但由于情感感知与复杂的场景级语义紧密相关，这仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题。

Method: 提出了MLLMsent框架，从三个角度研究MLLMs的情绪推理能力：(1)直接用于图像情感分类；(2)与预训练LLMs结合分析自动生成的图像描述；(3)在情感标注的图像描述上微调LLMs。

Result: 在基准测试中，特别是微调方法，相比Lexicon、CNN和Transformer基线分别提升了30.9%、64.8%和42.4%。在跨数据集测试中，无需在新数据上训练，仍比最佳竞争对手高出8.26%。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了所提出的视觉推理方案在推进情感计算方面的潜力，同时为未来研究建立了新的基准。

Abstract: Understanding how visual content communicates sentiment is critical in an era
where online interaction is increasingly dominated by this kind of media on
social platforms. However, this remains a challenging problem, as sentiment
perception is closely tied to complex, scene-level semantics. In this paper, we
propose an original framework, MLLMsent, to investigate the sentiment reasoning
capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through three
perspectives: (1) using those MLLMs for direct sentiment classification from
images; (2) associating them with pre-trained LLMs for sentiment analysis on
automatically generated image descriptions; and (3) fine-tuning the LLMs on
sentiment-labeled image descriptions. Experiments on a recent and established
benchmark demonstrate that our proposal, particularly the fine-tuned approach,
achieves state-of-the-art results outperforming Lexicon-, CNN-, and
Transformer-based baselines by up to 30.9%, 64.8%, and 42.4%, respectively,
across different levels of evaluators' agreement and sentiment polarity
categories. Remarkably, in a cross-dataset test, without any training on these
new data, our model still outperforms, by up to 8.26%, the best runner-up,
which has been trained directly on them. These results highlight the potential
of the proposed visual reasoning scheme for advancing affective computing,
while also establishing new benchmarks for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决恶劣天气条件下视觉信息损失问题，现有方法缺乏对文本信息的有效分类和深入分析，需要提升语义感知能力。

Method: 提出全局特征感知模块使用BLIP生成字幕提取整体场景特征和主要退化类型，局部模块使用ChatGPT生成详细场景描述关注具体退化效果，通过文本描述约束融合图像生成。

Result: 在复杂天气条件和下游任务中优于当前最先进方法，实验证明其有效性。

Conclusion: AWM-Fuse通过整合全局和局部文本感知，在恶劣天气条件下实现了更好的图像融合效果，为多模态图像融合提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multi-modality image fusion (MMIF) in adverse weather aims to address the
loss of visual information caused by weather-related degradations, providing
clearer scene representations. Although less studies have attempted to
incorporate textual information to improve semantic perception, they often lack
effective categorization and thorough analysis of textual content. In response,
we propose AWM-Fuse, a novel fusion method for adverse weather conditions,
designed to handle multiple degradations through global and local text
perception within a unified, shared weight architecture. In particular, a
global feature perception module leverages BLIP-produced captions to extract
overall scene features and identify primary degradation types, thus promoting
generalization across various adverse weather conditions. Complementing this,
the local module employs detailed scene descriptions produced by ChatGPT to
concentrate on specific degradation effects through concrete textual cues,
thereby capturing finer details. Furthermore, textual descriptions are used to
constrain the generation of fusion images, effectively steering the network
learning process toward better alignment with real semantic labels, thereby
promoting the learning of more meaningful visual features. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AWM-Fuse outperforms current state-of-the-art
methods in complex weather conditions and downstream tasks. Our code is

Conclusion: SAEViT为各种基础视觉任务提供了一个高效的轻量级解决方案，在计算效率和性能之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has prevailed in computer vision tasks due to its
strong long-range dependency modelling ability. However, its large model size
with high computational cost and weak local feature modeling ability hinder its
application in real scenarios. To balance computation efficiency and
performance, we propose SAEViT (Sparse-Attention-Efficient-ViT), a lightweight
ViT based model with convolution blocks, in this paper to achieve efficient
downstream vision tasks. Specifically, SAEViT introduces a Sparsely Aggregated
Attention (SAA) module that performs adaptive sparse sampling based on image
redundancy and recovers the feature map via deconvolution operation, which
significantly reduces the computational complexity of attention operations. In
addition, a Channel-Interactive Feed-Forward Network (CIFFN) layer is developed
to enhance inter-channel information exchange through feature decomposition and
redistribution, mitigating redundancy in traditional feed-forward networks
(FNN). Finally, a hierarchical pyramid structure with embedded depth-wise
separable convolutional blocks (DWSConv) is devised to further strengthen
convolutional features. Extensive experiments on mainstream datasets show that
SAEViT achieves Top-1 accuracies of 76.3\% and 79.6\% on the ImageNet-1K
classification task with only 0.8 GFLOPs and 1.3 GFLOPs, respectively,
demonstrating a lightweight solution for various fundamental vision tasks.

Motivation: 现有图像质量评估方法主要关注整体分数拟合，忽视了人类从多个维度评估图像质量的事实，需要更符合人类感知的多维度评估方法。

Method: 设计MDIQA框架，在技术和美学等多个感知维度上分别建模图像质量，各分支单独训练后融合特征生成最终质量分数，并可调整维度权重用于图像修复。

Conclusion: 多维度图像质量评估框架能够更好地捕捉人类视觉感知的多面性，为图像质量评估和图像修复提供了更灵活有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in image quality assessment (IQA), driven by
sophisticated deep neural network designs, have significantly improved the
ability to approach human perceptions. However, most existing methods are
obsessed with fitting the overall score, neglecting the fact that humans
typically evaluate image quality from different dimensions before arriving at
an overall quality assessment. To overcome this problem, we propose a
multi-dimensional image quality assessment (MDIQA) framework. Specifically, we
model image quality across various perceptual dimensions, including five
technical and four aesthetic dimensions, to capture the multifaceted nature of
human visual perception within distinct branches. Each branch of our MDIQA is
initially trained under the guidance of a separate dimension, and the
respective features are then amalgamated to generate the final IQA score.
Additionally, when the MDIQA model is ready, we can deploy it for a flexible
training of image restoration (IR) models, enabling the restoration results to
better align with varying user preferences through the adjustment of perceptual
dimension weights. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MDIQA achieves
superior performance and can be effectively and flexibly applied to image
restoration tasks. The code is available: https://github.com/YaoShunyu19/MDIQA.

from other angles. We attribute this failure to viewpoint bias in 2D diffusion
priors, which propagates into 3D optimization. To address this, we propose
Structural Energy-Guided Sampling (SEGS), a training-free, plug-and-play
framework that enforces multi-view consistency entirely at sampling time. SEGS
defines a structural energy in a PCA subspace of intermediate U-Net features
and injects its gradients into the denoising trajectory, steering geometry
toward the intended viewpoint while preserving appearance fidelity. Integrated
seamlessly into SDS/VSD pipelines, SEGS significantly reduces Janus artifacts,
achieving improved geometric alignment and viewpoint consistency without
retraining or weight modification.

*Yudong Hu,Yueju Han,Rui Sun,Jinke Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSPCaps是一个新颖的多尺度胶囊网络架构，通过多尺度特征提取、统一补丁化胶囊层和跨协议路由机制，有效解决了传统胶囊网络忽视多尺度特征和特征融合困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有胶囊网络通常依赖单一高层特征图，忽视了多尺度特征的互补信息，且传统特征融合策略难以协调多尺度特征差异，导致分类性能不佳。

Method: 提出MSPCaps架构，包含三个核心组件：多尺度ResNet骨干网络(MSRB)提取多尺度特征，补丁化胶囊层(PatchifyCaps)将多尺度特征统一分割为初级胶囊，跨协议路由(CAR)块通过识别最大协议跨尺度预测对来自适应路由多尺度胶囊。

Result: MSPCaps展现出卓越的可扩展性和鲁棒性，在分类准确率方面持续超越多个基线方法，参数配置从高效的Tiny模型(344.3K参数)到强大的Large模型(10.9M参数)。

Conclusion: MSPCaps通过有效整合多尺度特征学习和高效胶囊路由，在特征表示学习方面具有显著潜力，为胶囊网络的发展提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Capsule Network (CapsNet) has demonstrated significant potential in visual
recognition by capturing spatial relationships and part-whole hierarchies for
learning equivariant feature representations. However, existing CapsNet and
variants often rely on a single high-level feature map, overlooking the rich
complementary information from multi-scale features. Furthermore, conventional
feature fusion strategies (e.g., addition and concatenation) struggle to
reconcile multi-scale feature discrepancies, leading to suboptimal
classification performance. To address these limitations, we propose the
Multi-Scale Patchify Capsule Network (MSPCaps), a novel architecture that
integrates multi-scale feature learning and efficient capsule routing.
Specifically, MSPCaps consists of three key components: a Multi-Scale ResNet
Backbone (MSRB), a Patchify Capsule Layer (PatchifyCaps), and Cross-Agreement
Routing (CAR) blocks. First, the MSRB extracts diverse multi-scale feature
representations from input images, preserving both fine-grained details and
global contextual information. Second, the PatchifyCaps partitions these
multi-scale features into primary capsules using a uniform patch size,
equipping the model with the ability to learn from diverse receptive fields.
Finally, the CAR block adaptively routes the multi-scale capsules by
identifying cross-scale prediction pairs with maximum agreement. Unlike the
simple concatenation of multiple self-routing blocks, CAR ensures that only the
most coherent capsules contribute to the final voting. Our proposed MSPCaps
achieves remarkable scalability and superior robustness, consistently
surpassing multiple baseline methods in terms of classification accuracy, with
configurations ranging from a highly efficient Tiny model (344.3K parameters)
to a powerful Large model (10.9M parameters), highlighting its potential in
advancing feature representation learning.

TL;DR: CC-CMR是一种基于对比学习和跨模态对齐的框架，用于无钆对比剂的心肌病筛查，通过将电影CMR与延迟钆增强序列的潜在空间对齐，在电影CMR嵌入中编码纤维化特异性病理信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心脏磁共振(CMR)是心肌病诊断的金标准，但依赖钆对比剂和人工密集解读限制了其在大规模人群筛查中的应用，需要开发无钆的自动化筛查方法。

Method: 提出对比学习和跨模态对齐框架，通过特征交互模块同时优化诊断精度和跨模态特征一致性，并采用不确定性引导的自适应训练机制动态校准任务特定目标。

Result: 在多中心231名受试者数据上评估，CC-CMR达到0.943的准确率(95% CI: 0.886-0.986)，比最先进的仅电影CMR模型性能提升4.3%，同时消除了对钆的依赖。

Conclusion: CC-CMR展示了在广泛人群和医疗环境中进行无钆心肌病筛查的临床可行性，为大规模人群筛查提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Cardiomyopathy, a principal contributor to heart failure and sudden cardiac
mortality, demands precise early screening. Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR),
recognized as the diagnostic 'gold standard' through multiparametric protocols,
holds the potential to serve as an accurate screening tool. However, its
reliance on gadolinium contrast and labor-intensive interpretation hinders
population-scale deployment. We propose CC-CMR, a Contrastive Learning and
Cross-Modal alignment framework for gadolinium-free cardiomyopathy screening
using cine CMR sequences. By aligning the latent spaces of cine CMR and Late
Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) sequences, our model encodes fibrosis-specific
pathology into cine CMR embeddings. A Feature Interaction Module concurrently
optimizes diagnostic precision and cross-modal feature congruence, augmented by
an uncertainty-guided adaptive training mechanism that dynamically calibrates
task-specific objectives to ensure model generalizability. Evaluated on
multi-center data from 231 subjects, CC-CMR achieves accuracy of 0.943 (95% CI:
0.886-0.986), outperforming state-of-the-art cine-CMR-only models by 4.3% while
eliminating gadolinium dependency, demonstrating its clinical viability for
wide range of populations and healthcare environments.

*Qi Song,Ziyuan Luo,Ka Chun Cheung,Simon See,Renjie Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Invert3D是一个新颖的3D内容个性化框架，通过建立3D表示与文本嵌入空间的对齐，实现无需重新训练的自然语言驱动的3D内容个性化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D个性化方法主要依赖基于知识蒸馏的方法，需要计算昂贵的重新训练过程。虽然视觉语言模型如CLIP能够通过对齐的视觉-文本嵌入空间实现直接图像个性化，但由于3D内容与2D图像之间的结构差异，这些技术无法直接应用于3D个性化。

Method: 开发了相机条件的3D到文本逆向机制，将3D内容投影到与文本嵌入对齐的3D嵌入空间中。通过建立3D表示与文本嵌入空间的对齐，实现自然语言提示下的高效3D内容操作和个性化。

Result: 大量实验证明Invert3D能够有效实现3D内容的个性化，消除了计算密集型重新训练过程的需求。

Conclusion: Invert3D通过桥接3D内容与文本嵌入空间之间的差距，为3D内容个性化提供了一种便捷高效的解决方案，推动了3D内容合成领域的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in NeRF and 3DGS have significantly enhanced the efficiency
and quality of 3D content synthesis. However, efficient personalization of
generated 3D content remains a critical challenge. Current 3D personalization
approaches predominantly rely on knowledge distillation-based methods, which
require computationally expensive retraining procedures. To address this
challenge, we propose \textbf{Invert3D}, a novel framework for convenient 3D
content personalization. Nowadays, vision-language models such as CLIP enable
direct image personalization through aligned vision-text embedding spaces.
However, the inherent structural differences between 3D content and 2D images
preclude direct application of these techniques to 3D personalization. Our
approach bridges this gap by establishing alignment between 3D representations
and text embedding spaces. Specifically, we develop a camera-conditioned
3D-to-text inverse mechanism that projects 3D contents into a 3D embedding
aligned with text embeddings. This alignment enables efficient manipulation and
personalization of 3D content through natural language prompts, eliminating the
need for computationally retraining procedures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Invert3D achieves effective personalization of 3D content. Our

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NAT方法通过针对神经网络中的特定神经元进行攻击，而不是传统的嵌入层级别攻击，显著提高了对抗性扰动的可迁移性，在跨模型和跨域设置中分别超过现有基线14%和4%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常在源模型的单个中间层最大化干净图像和对抗图像的嵌入分离，但这种方法往往过度关注少数代表相似概念的神经元，而忽略层内其他神经元。

Method: 提出Neuron Attack for Transferability (NAT)方法，将焦点从嵌入级分离转移到更基础的神经元特异性方法，通过针对单个神经元来破坏神经网络的核心单元。

Result: 在41个不同的ImageNet模型和9个细粒度模型上进行广泛实验，NAT在跨模型设置中超过现有基线14%以上，在跨域设置中超过4%。通过利用训练生成器的互补攻击能力，仅用10次查询就能获得令人印象深刻的欺骗率。

Conclusion: 针对特定神经元的攻击方法为跨不同模型的可迁移性提供了共同基础，显著提升了对抗性攻击的效果和效率。

Abstract: The generation of transferable adversarial perturbations typically involves
training a generator to maximize embedding separation between clean and
adversarial images at a single mid-layer of a source model. In this work, we
build on this approach and introduce Neuron Attack for Transferability (NAT), a
method designed to target specific neuron within the embedding. Our approach is
motivated by the observation that previous layer-level optimizations often
disproportionately focus on a few neurons representing similar concepts,
leaving other neurons within the attacked layer minimally affected. NAT shifts
the focus from embedding-level separation to a more fundamental,
neuron-specific approach. We find that targeting individual neurons effectively
disrupts the core units of the neural network, providing a common basis for
transferability across different models. Through extensive experiments on 41
diverse ImageNet models and 9 fine-grained models, NAT achieves fooling rates
that surpass existing baselines by over 14\% in cross-model and 4\% in
cross-domain settings. Furthermore, by leveraging the complementary attacking
capabilities of the trained generators, we achieve impressive fooling rates
within just 10 queries. Our code is available at:

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现出优越性能，证明了该方法能够提供准确且可解释的动作评估。

Conclusion: HieroAction通过结合分步推理和策略学习，成功实现了准确、结构化且可解释的人类动作评估，解决了现有方法缺乏解释性的问题。

Abstract: Evaluating human actions with clear and detailed feedback is important in
areas such as sports, healthcare, and robotics, where decisions rely not only
on final outcomes but also on interpretable reasoning. However, most existing
methods provide only a final score without explanation or detailed analysis,
limiting their practical applicability. To address this, we introduce
HieroAction, a vision-language model that delivers accurate and structured
assessments of human actions. HieroAction builds on two key ideas: (1) Stepwise
Action Reasoning, a tailored chain of thought process designed specifically for
action assessment, which guides the model to evaluate actions step by step,
from overall recognition through sub action analysis to final scoring, thus
enhancing interpretability and structured understanding; and (2) Hierarchical
Policy Learning, a reinforcement learning strategy that enables the model to
learn fine grained sub action dynamics and align them with high level action
quality, thereby improving scoring precision. The reasoning pathway structures
the evaluation process, while policy learning refines each stage through reward
based optimization. Their integration ensures accurate and interpretable
assessments, as demonstrated by superior performance across multiple benchmark
datasets. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: RPD-Diff通过物理引导和区域自适应机制有效解决了密集非均匀雾霾去雾的挑战，为复杂雾霾场景下的图像增强提供了强有力的解决方案。

Abstract: Single-image dehazing under dense and non-uniform haze conditions remains
challenging due to severe information degradation and spatial heterogeneity.
Traditional diffusion-based dehazing methods struggle with insufficient
generation conditioning and lack of adaptability to spatially varying haze
distributions, which leads to suboptimal restoration. To address these
limitations, we propose RPD-Diff, a Region-adaptive Physics-guided Dehazing
Diffusion Model for robust visibility enhancement in complex haze scenarios.
RPD-Diff introduces a Physics-guided Intermediate State Targeting (PIST)
strategy, which leverages physical priors to reformulate the diffusion Markov
chain by generation target transitions, mitigating the issue of insufficient
conditioning in dense haze scenarios. Additionally, the Haze-Aware Denoising
Timestep Predictor (HADTP) dynamically adjusts patch-specific denoising
timesteps employing a transmission map cross-attention mechanism, adeptly
managing non-uniform haze distributions. Extensive experiments across four
real-world datasets demonstrate that RPD-Diff achieves state-of-the-art
performance in challenging dense and non-uniform haze scenarios, delivering
high-quality, haze-free images with superior detail clarity and color fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的群体计数模型LIMM，通过强调局部建模能力来解决人群头部在图像中占比很小的问题，采用窗口划分和对比学习策略，在多个数据集上实现了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新思考群体计数的本质特征：人群中的个体（人头）通常只占图像的很小部分，但现有方法都使用与其他视觉任务相同的骨干网络并追求大感受野，忽视了局部建模能力的重要性。

Method: 提出LIMM模型，采用两种策略：1）窗口划分设计，将模型输入划分为网格窗口；2）窗口级对比学习设计，增强模型区分局部密度水平的能力；最后使用全局注意力模块处理偶尔出现的大尺寸个体。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上的实验表明，该模型在局部建模能力上有显著提升（如在JHU-Crowd++高密度子集上MAE提升8.7%），同时不影响对大尺寸个体的计数能力，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 强调局部建模能力是群体计数模型设计的重要原则，LIMM模型通过创新的窗口划分和对比学习策略有效解决了小尺寸个体的计数问题，为群体计数任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The motivation of this paper originates from rethinking an essential
characteristic of crowd counting: individuals (heads of humans) in the crowd
counting task typically occupy a very small portion of the image. This
characteristic has never been the focus of existing works: they typically use
the same backbone as other visual tasks and pursue a large receptive field.
This drives us to propose a new model design principle of crowd counting:
emphasizing local modeling capability of the model. We follow the principle and
design a crowd counting model named Local Information Matters Model (LIMM). The
main innovation lies in two strategies: a window partitioning design that
applies grid windows to the model input, and a window-wise contrastive learning
design to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between local density
levels. Moreover, a global attention module is applied to the end of the model
to handle the occasionally occurring large-sized individuals. Extensive
experiments on multiple public datasets illustrate that the proposed model
shows a significant improvement in local modeling capability (8.7\% in MAE on
the JHU-Crowd++ high-density subset for example), without compromising its
ability to count large-sized ones, which achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理科学图表方面具有巨大潜力，但缺乏对噪声、模糊、遮挡等常见视觉扰动的鲁棒性，现有评估基准忽视了这一问题，限制了实际部署应用。

Method: 提出RDR框架，采用自适应多视角一致性验证(AMCV)机制：生成多个扰动版本图表，进行并行推理，然后应用基于一致性的自校正循环。同时提出PRS和VDC两个新评估指标，并构建了SciDiagram-Robust数据集。

Result: 实验表明，即使是GPT-4V等最先进的闭源多模态大语言模型，在面对扰动输入时也表现出显著的性能下降（清洁准确率85.2% vs PRS 72.1%）。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了当前多模态大语言模型在视觉扰动下的脆弱性，提出的RDR框架和评估方法为提升模型在真实科学文档处理中的鲁棒性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants (LVLMs) hold
immense promise for scientific and engineering applications, particularly in
processing visual information like scientific diagrams. However, their
practical deployment is hindered by a critical lack of robustness to common
visual perturbations such as noise, blur, and occlusions, which are prevalent
in real-world scientific documents. Existing evaluation benchmarks largely
overlook this challenge, leaving the robust reasoning capabilities of LVLMs on
visually degraded scientific diagrams underexplored. To address this, we
introduce the Robust Diagram Reasoning (RDR) framework, a novel approach
designed to enhance and rigorously evaluate LVLMs' performance under such
conditions. At its core, RDR employs an Adaptive Multi-View & Consistency
Verification (AMCV) mechanism, which involves generating multiple perturbed
versions of a diagram, performing parallel inference, and then applying a
consistency-based self-correction loop. We also propose two new metrics,
Perturbation Robustness Score (PRS) and Visual Degradation Consistency (VDC),
to quantify robustness. Furthermore, we construct SciDiagram-Robust, the first
large-scale scientific diagram question-answering dataset specifically
augmented with diverse, programmatically generated visual perturbations. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art closed-source
LVLMs like GPT-4V exhibit significant performance degradation when faced with
perturbed inputs (Clean Accuracy 85.2% vs. PRS 72.1%).

Conclusion: BSAM方法通过平衡泛化能力有效解决了不平衡回归问题，在多个视觉任务上取得了优异性能

Abstract: Regression is fundamental in computer vision and is widely used in various
tasks including age estimation, depth estimation, target localization, \etc
However, real-world data often exhibits imbalanced distribution, making
regression models perform poorly especially for target values with rare
observations~(known as the imbalanced regression problem). In this paper, we
reframe imbalanced regression as an imbalanced generalization problem. To
tackle that, we look into the loss sharpness property for measuring the
generalization ability of regression models in the observation space. Namely,
given a certain perturbation on the model parameters, we check how model
performance changes according to the loss values of different target
observations. We propose a simple yet effective approach called Balanced
Sharpness-Aware Minimization~(BSAM) to enforce the uniform generalization
ability of regression models for the entire observation space. In particular,
we start from the traditional sharpness-aware minimization and then introduce a
novel targeted reweighting strategy to homogenize the generalization ability
across the observation space, which guarantees a theoretical generalization
bound. Extensive experiments on multiple vision regression tasks, including age
and depth estimation, demonstrate that our BSAM method consistently outperforms
existing approaches. The code is available

Conclusion: 分层设计有效增强了细粒度视觉语言理解和精确定位能力，验证了模仿人类认知处理方式在提升模型性能方面的有效性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress in natural language processing and multimodal
understanding. Despite their impressive generalization capabilities, current
LVLMs often exhibit insufficient robustness, proneness to hallucination, and
reasoning errors in complex real-world scenarios, particularly when precise
image region localization and fine-grained visual reasoning are required. To
address these limitations, we propose the Hierarchical Contextual Grounding
LVLM (HCG-LVLM), a novel architecture that mimics human coarse-to-fine
cognitive processing. HCG-LVLM employs a two-layered approach: a Global
Contextual Perception layer for initial broad understanding and a Fine-grained
Local Grounding layer. The latter incorporates a Local Detail Enhancement
Module to extract high-resolution features and a Semantic Consistency Validator
to ensure accurate, hallucination-free visual-language alignment. Through an
adaptive fusion mechanism, information from both layers is integrated for
robust and precise outputs. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets,
including GQA, A-OKVQA for fine-grained VQA, and RefCOCO/+/g for Referring
Expression Comprehension, demonstrate that HCG-LVLM consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art models such as Flamingo, BLIP-2, and MiniGPT-4. Our model
achieves superior accuracy and significantly reduces hallucination, validating
the effectiveness of its hierarchical design in enhancing fine-grained
visual-language understanding and precise grounding capabilities.

Abstract: Domain generalization seeks to develop models trained on a limited set of
source domains that are capable of generalizing effectively to unseen target
domains. While the predominant approach leverages large-scale pre-trained
vision models as initialization, recent studies have highlighted that full
fine-tuning can compromise the intrinsic generalization capabilities of these
models. To address this limitation, parameter-efficient adaptation strategies
have emerged, wherein only a subset of model parameters is selectively
fine-tuned, thereby balancing task adaptation with the preservation of
generalization. Motivated by this paradigm, we introduce Joint Parameter
Selection (JPS), a novel method that restricts updates to a small, sparse
subset of parameters, thereby retaining and harnessing the generalization
strength of pre-trained models. Theoretically, we establish a generalization
error bound that explicitly accounts for the sparsity of parameter updates,
thereby providing a principled justification for selective fine-tuning.
Practically, we design a selection mechanism employing dual operators to
identify and update parameters exhibiting consistent and significant gradients
across all source domains. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that JPS
achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art domain
generalization methods, substantiating both the efficiency and efficacy of the
proposed approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然生成效果好但计算成本高，现有特征缓存方法因无法准确建模特征演化复杂动态而导致质量下降

Method: 利用扩散变换器中特征导数近似呈现多元高斯特性的洞察，采用Hermite多项式作为理论基础，并引入双尺度机制确保数值稳定性

Result: 在FLUX.1-dev上实现6.24倍加速且超过基线质量，在文本到图像、视频生成和超分辨率任务中均表现优异

Conclusion: HiCache通过理论对齐和经验特性的结合，为扩散模型提供了高效且高质量的推理加速解决方案

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in content generation but
suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to iterative sampling. While
recent feature caching methods tend to accelerate inference through temporal
extrapolation, these methods still suffer from server quality loss due to the
failure in modeling the complex dynamics of feature evolution. To solve this
problem, this paper presents HiCache, a training-free acceleration framework
that fundamentally improves feature prediction by aligning mathematical tools
with empirical properties. Our key insight is that feature derivative
approximations in Diffusion Transformers exhibit multivariate Gaussian
characteristics, motivating the use of Hermite polynomials-the potentially
theoretically optimal basis for Gaussian-correlated processes. Besides, We
further introduce a dual-scaling mechanism that ensures numerical stability
while preserving predictive accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate
HiCache's superiority: achieving 6.24x speedup on FLUX.1-dev while exceeding
baseline quality, maintaining strong performance across text-to-image, video
generation, and super-resolution tasks. Core implementation is provided in the
appendix, with complete code to be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: EDLDNet是一种高效的医学图像分割网络，通过双线解码器设计在保持高精度的同时显著降低计算成本，在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在医学图像分割中难以平衡准确性和计算效率，要么性能好但计算复杂，要么效率高但精度低。

Method: 提出EDLDNet网络，包含噪声解码器（训练时加入结构化扰动增强鲁棒性，推理时只使用无噪声解码器）、多尺度卷积注意力模块、注意力门和上卷积块，并采用基于突变的损失函数。

Result: 在四个公开医学影像数据集上超越SOTA方法，Synapse数据集Dice得分84.00%，比UNet提升13.89%，同时减少89.7%的MACs操作。

Conclusion: EDLDNet在多个数据集上表现出优异的泛化能力、计算效率和鲁棒性，成功解决了准确性与效率的平衡问题。

Abstract: Proper segmentation of organs-at-risk is important for radiation therapy,
surgical planning, and diagnostic decision-making in medical image analysis.
While deep learning-based segmentation architectures have made significant
progress, they often fail to balance segmentation accuracy with computational
efficiency. Most of the current state-of-the-art methods either prioritize
performance at the cost of high computational complexity or compromise accuracy
for efficiency. This paper addresses this gap by introducing an efficient
dual-line decoder segmentation network (EDLDNet). The proposed method features
a noisy decoder, which learns to incorporate structured perturbation at
training time for better model robustness, yet at inference time only the
noise-free decoder is executed, leading to lower computational cost.
Multi-Scale convolutional Attention Modules (MSCAMs), Attention Gates (AGs),
and Up-Convolution Blocks (UCBs) are further utilized to optimize feature
representation and boost segmentation performance. By leveraging multi-scale
segmentation masks from both decoders, we also utilize a mutation-based loss
function to enhance the model's generalization. Our approach outperforms SOTA
segmentation architectures on four publicly available medical imaging datasets.
EDLDNet achieves SOTA performance with an 84.00% Dice score on the Synapse
dataset, surpassing baseline model like UNet by 13.89% in Dice score while
significantly reducing Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) by 89.7%. Compared
to recent approaches like EMCAD, our EDLDNet not only achieves higher Dice
score but also maintains comparable computational efficiency. The outstanding
performance across diverse datasets establishes EDLDNet's strong
generalization, computational efficiency, and robustness. The source code,
pre-processed data, and pre-trained weights will be available at

TL;DR: CPC是一个新颖的弱监督语义分割框架，利用LLM获取类别聚类关系，通过对比损失实现类内一致性和类间分离，在PASCAL VOC和MS COCO上达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有弱监督语义分割方法过于强调类间分离，忽视了相关类别间的共享语义，缺乏细粒度区分能力

Method: 提出对比提示聚类(CPC)框架：1)利用大语言模型获取编码类别间内在关系的聚类；2)引入类感知的patch级对比损失来增强类内一致性和类间分离

Result: 在PASCAL VOC 2012和MS COCO 2014数据集上的实验表明，CPC超越了现有的最先进弱监督语义分割方法

Conclusion: CPC的分层设计利用聚类作为粗粒度语义先验，同时保持细粒度边界，有效减少了视觉相似类别间的混淆

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels has
gained attention for its cost-effectiveness. Most existing methods emphasize
inter-class separation, often neglecting the shared semantics among related
categories and lacking fine-grained discrimination. To address this, we propose
Contrastive Prompt Clustering (CPC), a novel WSSS framework. CPC exploits Large
Language Models (LLMs) to derive category clusters that encode intrinsic
inter-class relationships, and further introduces a class-aware patch-level
contrastive loss to enforce intra-class consistency and inter-class separation.
This hierarchical design leverages clusters as coarse-grained semantic priors
while preserving fine-grained boundaries, thereby reducing confusion among
visually similar categories. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014
demonstrate that CPC surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in WSSS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合高斯泼溅渲染与结构化标记的混合框架，用于在复杂环境中高效生成高保真3D模拟，特别适用于农业温室等具有遮挡和重复结构的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于网格的3D模拟在复杂环境（如密集温室）中表现不佳，而现有的神经渲染方法虽然视觉真实感强，但缺乏整合基准标记的能力，而这对机器人定位和控制至关重要。

Method: 开发了一种混合框架，将高斯泼溅(GS)的光照真实感与结构化标记表示相结合，核心贡献是提出了一种新颖算法，能够在杂乱场景中高效生成基于GS的基准标记（如AprilTags）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在效率和姿态估计精度方面均优于传统的图像拟合技术，并在温室模拟中展示了框架的潜力。

Conclusion: 该框架在具有密集 foliage、相似元素和遮挡的农业环境中表现出色，突显了其在现实世界应用中的价值，特别是在需要高精度定位的机器人任务中。

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D simulation is critical for training mobile robots, but its
traditional reliance on mesh-based representations often struggle in complex
environments, such as densely packed greenhouses featuring occlusions and
repetitive structures. Recent neural rendering methods, like Gaussian Splatting
(GS), achieve remarkable visual realism but lack flexibility to incorporate
fiducial markers, which are essential for robotic localization and control. We
propose a hybrid framework that combines the photorealism of GS with structured
marker representations. Our core contribution is a novel algorithm for
efficiently generating GS-based fiducial markers (e.g., AprilTags) within
cluttered scenes. Experiments show that our approach outperforms traditional
image-fitting techniques in both efficiency and pose-estimation accuracy. We
further demonstrate the framework's potential in a greenhouse simulation. This
agricultural setting serves as a challenging testbed, as its combination of
dense foliage, similar-looking elements, and occlusions pushes the limits of
perception, thereby highlighting the framework's value for real-world
applications.

*Konstantina Nikolaidou,George Retsinas,Giorgos Sfikas,Silvia Cascianelli,Rita Cucchiara,Marcus Liwicki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Dual Orthogonal Guidance (DOG)采样策略，通过正交投影改善扩散模型在手写文本生成中的清晰度和风格多样性，特别针对生僻词和挑战性书写风格。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在手写文本生成中容易记忆训练样本，对风格变化敏感，且在高引导尺度下产生噪声和伪影，影响生成文本的可读性。

Method: DOG策略利用负向扰动提示的正交投影到原始正向提示，在潜在空间中提供更稳定的解耦方向，并采用三角形调度控制去噪过程中的引导强度。

Result: 在DiffusionPen和One-DM上的实验表明，DOG提高了内容清晰度和风格多样性，即使在生僻词和挑战性书写风格下也表现良好。

Conclusion: DOG是一种有效的采样引导策略，能够改善扩散模型在手写文本生成中的性能，减少伪影同时保持内容准确性。

Abstract: Diffusion-based Handwritten Text Generation (HTG) approaches achieve
impressive results on frequent, in-vocabulary words observed at training time
and on regular styles. However, they are prone to memorizing training samples
and often struggle with style variability and generation clarity. In
particular, standard diffusion models tend to produce artifacts or distortions
that negatively affect the readability of the generated text, especially when
the style is hard to produce. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel
sampling guidance strategy, Dual Orthogonal Guidance (DOG), that leverages an
orthogonal projection of a negatively perturbed prompt onto the original
positive prompt. This approach helps steer the generation away from artifacts
while maintaining the intended content, and encourages more diverse, yet
plausible, outputs. Unlike standard Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which
relies on unconditional predictions and produces noise at high guidance scales,
DOG introduces a more stable, disentangled direction in the latent space. To
control the strength of the guidance across the denoising process, we apply a
triangular schedule: weak at the start and end of denoising, when the process
is most sensitive, and strongest in the middle steps. Experimental results on
the state-of-the-art DiffusionPen and One-DM demonstrate that DOG improves both
content clarity and style variability, even for out-of-vocabulary words and
challenging writing styles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流在线动作检测模型对视频视角变化敏感，在面对未见过的视频源时泛化能力不足，需要解决跨视角的泛化问题

Method: 提出概率时序掩码注意力(PTMA)模型，利用概率建模获得潜在压缩表示，结合GRU-based时序掩码注意力单元进行视频序列查询，支持多视角信息融合提取视角不变特征

Result: 在DAHLIA、IKEA ASM和Breakfast数据集上，通过跨主体、跨视角和跨主体-视角三种评估协议验证，PTMA达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: PTMA模型通过概率建模和时序注意力机制有效解决了在线动作检测中的视角泛化问题，在多视角场景下表现出优异的性能

Abstract: As a critical task in video sequence classification within computer vision,
Online Action Detection (OAD) has garnered significant attention. The
sensitivity of mainstream OAD models to varying video viewpoints often hampers
their generalization when confronted with unseen sources. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel Probabilistic Temporal Masked Attention (PTMA)
model, which leverages probabilistic modeling to derive latent compressed
representations of video frames in a cross-view setting. The PTMA model
incorporates a GRU-based temporal masked attention (TMA) cell, which leverages
these representations to effectively query the input video sequence, thereby
enhancing information interaction and facilitating autoregressive frame-level
video analysis. Additionally, multi-view information can be integrated into the
probabilistic modeling to facilitate the extraction of view-invariant features.
Experiments conducted under three evaluation protocols: cross-subject (cs),
cross-view (cv), and cross-subject-view (csv) show that PTMA achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the DAHLIA, IKEA ASM, and Breakfast datasets.

*Mingliang Li,Lin Yuanbo Wu,Changhong Liu,Hanxi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的局部聚焦机制(LFM)来解决深度假写检测中的跨领域氛化问题，通过突出关注匿作图片中的匿作特征，在准确性和效率方面都超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的重构学习方法基于深度卷积网络，但存在两个核心问题：网络深度增加导致过拟合语义特征分布，以及全局平均池化(GAP)会丢失关键的局部匿作线索，从而影响检测方法在不同物体类别和生成领域间的氛化能力。

Method: 提出局部聚焦机制(LFM)，包含显著性网络(SNet)和任务特定Top-K池化(TKP)模块，用于选择K个最有信息的局部模式。为了避免Top-K池化导致的过拟合，还提出了排名基线性洒淀(RBLD)和随机K采样(RKS)两种正则化技术。

Result: LFM方法在准确性上比最先进的邻近像素关系(NPR)方法提高3.7%，平均精度提高2.8%，同时保持极高的效率(1789 FPS于单颗NVIDIA A6000 GPU)。

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式关注匿作图片中的匿作特征，有效解决了现有检测方法的氛化问题，为跨领域深度假写检测设置了新的标杆。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deepfake generation techniques has intensified the
need for robust and generalizable detection methods. Existing approaches based
on reconstruction learning typically leverage deep convolutional networks to
extract differential features. However, these methods show poor generalization
across object categories (e.g., from faces to cars) and generation domains
(e.g., from GANs to Stable Diffusion), due to intrinsic limitations of deep
CNNs. First, models trained on a specific category tend to overfit to semantic
feature distributions, making them less transferable to other categories,
especially as network depth increases. Second, Global Average Pooling (GAP)
compresses critical local forgery cues into a single vector, thus discarding
discriminative patterns vital for real-fake classification. To address these
issues, we propose a novel Local Focus Mechanism (LFM) that explicitly attends
to discriminative local features for differentiating fake from real images. LFM
integrates a Salience Network (SNet) with a task-specific Top-K Pooling (TKP)
module to select the K most informative local patterns. To mitigate potential
overfitting introduced by Top-K pooling, we introduce two regularization
techniques: Rank-Based Linear Dropout (RBLD) and Random-K Sampling (RKS), which
enhance the model's robustness. LFM achieves a 3.7 improvement in accuracy and
a 2.8 increase in average precision over the state-of-the-art Neighboring Pixel
Relationships (NPR) method, while maintaining exceptional efficiency at 1789
FPS on a single NVIDIA A6000 GPU. Our approach sets a new benchmark for
cross-domain deepfake detection. The source code are available in

Abstract: The proliferation of digital food content has intensified the need for robust
and accurate systems capable of fine-grained visual understanding and
retrieval. In this work, we address the challenging task of food image-to-text
matching, a critical component in applications such as dietary monitoring,
smart kitchens, and restaurant automation. We propose F4-ITS: Fine-grained
Feature Fusion for Food Image-Text Search, a training-free, vision-language
model (VLM)-guided framework that significantly improves retrieval performance
through enhanced multi-modal feature representations. Our approach introduces
two key contributions: (1) a uni-directional(and bi-directional) multi-modal
fusion strategy that combines image embeddings with VLM-generated textual
descriptions to improve query expressiveness, and (2) a novel feature-based
re-ranking mechanism for top-k retrieval, leveraging predicted food ingredients
to refine results and boost precision. Leveraging open-source image-text
encoders, we demonstrate substantial gains over standard baselines - achieving
~10% and ~7.7% improvements in top-1 retrieval under dense and sparse caption
scenarios, and a ~28.6% gain in top-k ingredient-level retrieval. Additionally,
we show that smaller models (e.g., ViT-B/32) can match or outperform larger
counterparts (e.g., ViT-H, ViT-G, ViT-bigG) when augmented with textual fusion,
highlighting the effectiveness of our method in resource-constrained settings.

segmentation and tracking module; an odometry estimation module, including
trainable algorithms; a module for 3D map construction and updating with
various implementations depending on the desired scene representation; and a
multimodal data retrieval module. The article highlights original
implementations of these modules and their advantages in solving various

Additionally, we provide a systematic evaluation of the augmentation techniques

Conclusion: PVNet通过点-体素交互框架有效解决了室外场景点云稀疏性问题，为下游3D感知任务提供了高质量的点云数据。

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene understanding in outdoor environments heavily relies on
high-quality point clouds. However, LiDAR-scanned data often suffer from
extreme sparsity, severely hindering downstream 3D perception tasks. Existing
point cloud upsampling methods primarily focus on individual objects, thus
demonstrating limited generalization capability for complex outdoor scenes. To
address this issue, we propose PVNet, a diffusion model-based point-voxel
interaction framework to perform LiDAR point cloud upsampling without dense
supervision. Specifically, we adopt the classifier-free guidance-based DDPMs to
guide the generation, in which we employ a sparse point cloud as the guiding
condition and the synthesized point clouds derived from its nearby frames as
the input. Moreover, we design a voxel completion module to refine and complete
the coarse voxel features for enriching the feature representation. In
addition, we propose a point-voxel interaction module to integrate features
from both points and voxels, which efficiently improves the environmental
perception capability of each upsampled point. To the best of our knowledge,
our approach is the first scene-level point cloud upsampling method supporting
arbitrary upsampling rates. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. The source
code will be available at https://github.com/chengxianjing/PVNet.

Abstract: Previous dominant methods for scene flow estimation focus mainly on input
from two consecutive frames, neglecting valuable information in the temporal
domain. While recent trends shift towards multi-frame reasoning, they suffer
from rapidly escalating computational costs as the number of frames grows. To
leverage temporal information more efficiently, we propose DeltaFlow
($\Delta$Flow), a lightweight 3D framework that captures motion cues via a
$\Delta$ scheme, extracting temporal features with minimal computational cost,
regardless of the number of frames. Additionally, scene flow estimation faces
challenges such as imbalanced object class distributions and motion
inconsistency. To tackle these issues, we introduce a Category-Balanced Loss to
enhance learning across underrepresented classes and an Instance Consistency
Loss to enforce coherent object motion, improving flow accuracy. Extensive
evaluations on the Argoverse 2 and Waymo datasets show that $\Delta$Flow
achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 22% lower error and $2\times$
faster inference compared to the next-best multi-frame supervised method, while
also demonstrating a strong cross-domain generalization ability. The code is

Motivation: 虽然硬件技术和渲染技术有了显著进步，但在动态环境中以实时帧率实现真实照相效果仍面临视觉质量与性能的争执挑战

Method: 提出REGEN框架，使用双阶段生成对抗网络，先通过稳健的非配对图像转换模型生成语义一致的照相实际帧，然后将问题转换为简化的配对图像转换任务

Abstract: Photorealism is an important aspect of modern video games since it can shape
the player experience and simultaneously impact the immersion, narrative
engagement, and visual fidelity. Although recent hardware technological
breakthroughs, along with state-of-the-art rendering technologies, have
significantly improved the visual realism of video games, achieving true
photorealism in dynamic environments at real-time frame rates still remains a
major challenge due to the tradeoff between visual quality and performance. In
this short paper, we present a novel approach for enhancing the photorealism of
rendered game frames using generative adversarial networks. To this end, we
propose Real-time photorealism Enhancement in Games via a dual-stage gEnerative
Network framework (REGEN), which employs a robust unpaired image-to-image
translation model to produce semantically consistent photorealistic frames that
transform the problem into a simpler paired image-to-image translation task.
This enables training with a lightweight method that can achieve real-time
inference time without compromising visual quality. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework on Grand Theft Auto V, showing that the approach
achieves visual results comparable to the ones produced by the robust unpaired
Im2Im method while improving inference speed by 32.14 times. Our findings also
indicate that the results outperform the photorealism-enhanced frames produced
by directly training a lightweight unpaired Im2Im translation method to
translate the video game frames towards the visual characteristics of
real-world images. Code, pre-trained models, and demos for this work are

Method: 采用解耦的两阶段过程：第一阶段通过预训练多模态模型生成空间感知视觉提示；第二阶段通过轻量级SSG-Adapter将联合条件注入冻结的视频DiT主干网络，采用双分支注意力机制。

Result: 在VBench基准测试中达到最先进性能，在空间关系控制和整体一致性等关键指标上超越现有模型。

Conclusion: SSG-DiT框架通过空间信号引导和高效适配器设计，成功解决了可控视频生成中的语义一致性问题，为高保真视频合成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Controllable video generation aims to synthesize video content that aligns
precisely with user-provided conditions, such as text descriptions and initial
images. However, a significant challenge persists in this domain: existing
models often struggle to maintain strong semantic consistency, frequently
generating videos that deviate from the nuanced details specified in the
prompts. To address this issue, we propose SSG-DiT (Spatial Signal Guided
Diffusion Transformer), a novel and efficient framework for high-fidelity
controllable video generation. Our approach introduces a decoupled two-stage
process. The first stage, Spatial Signal Prompting, generates a spatially aware
visual prompt by leveraging the rich internal representations of a pre-trained
multi-modal model. This prompt, combined with the original text, forms a joint
condition that is then injected into a frozen video DiT backbone via our
lightweight and parameter-efficient SSG-Adapter. This unique design, featuring
a dual-branch attention mechanism, allows the model to simultaneously harness
its powerful generative priors while being precisely steered by external
spatial signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSG-DiT achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing models on multiple key
metrics in the VBench benchmark, particularly in spatial relationship control
and overall consistency.

### [55] [Proximal Vision Transformer: Enhancing Feature Representation through Two-Stage Manifold Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17081)
*Haoyu Yun,Hamid Krim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的框架，将Vision Transformer与近端工具相结合，通过统一的几何优化方法来改善特征表示和分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然ViT在计算机视觉中取得了显著成功，但其优化仅限于模型单张图像内部的局部关系，无法捐捕数据点之间的全局几何关系。

Method: 通过ViT的自注意机制构建流形的切线束，每个注意头对应一个切线空间，提供多样化的局部视角几何表示。然后引入近端迭代来定义切线束内的截面并将数据从切线空间投影到基空间，实现全局特征对齐和优化。

Result: 实验结果证实，所提方法在分类准确性和数据分布方面都超过了传统ViT。

Conclusion: 这种统一的几何优化框架有效地扩展了ViT的能力，能够捐捕更丰富的全局几何关系，提升了特征表示和分类性能。

Abstract: The Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture has become widely recognized in
computer vision, leveraging its self-attention mechanism to achieve remarkable
success across various tasks. Despite its strengths, ViT's optimization remains
confined to modeling local relationships within individual images, limiting its
ability to capture the global geometric relationships between data points. To
address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel framework that integrates
ViT with the proximal tools, enabling a unified geometric optimization approach
to enhance feature representation and classification performance. In this
framework, ViT constructs the tangent bundle of the manifold through its
self-attention mechanism, where each attention head corresponds to a tangent
space, offering geometric representations from diverse local perspectives.
Proximal iterations are then introduced to define sections within the tangent
bundle and project data from tangent spaces onto the base space, achieving
global feature alignment and optimization. Experimental results confirm that
the proposed method outperforms traditional ViT in terms of classification
accuracy and data distribution.

*Pedro Silva,Guilherme A. L. Silva,Pablo Coelho,Vander Freitas,Gladston Moreira,David Menotii,Eduardo Luz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PD-Loss是一种新的深度度量学习方法，结合了代理方法和可决策性指数，在保持计算效率的同时优化嵌入空间的全局分布特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度度量学习方法存在局限性：成对损失需要复杂采样且收敛慢，代理方法虽然可扩展但无法优化全局分布特性，而D-Loss依赖大批量导致计算成本高。

Method: 提出Proxy-Decidability Loss (PD-Loss)，通过可学习代理来估计真实和冒名分布，结合可决策性指数(d')的统计框架，高效优化嵌入空间的可分离性。

Result: 在细粒度分类和人脸验证等任务中，PD-Loss达到了与最先进方法相当的性能，同时提供了计算效率更高的解决方案。

Conclusion: PD-Loss成功地将代理方法的计算效率与D-Loss的原则性可分离性相结合，为分布感知的深度度量学习提供了可扩展的新视角，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Deep Metric Learning (DML) aims to learn embedding functions that map
semantically similar inputs to proximate points in a metric space while
separating dissimilar ones. Existing methods, such as pairwise losses, are
hindered by complex sampling requirements and slow convergence. In contrast,
proxy-based losses, despite their improved scalability, often fail to optimize
global distribution properties. The Decidability-based Loss (D-Loss) addresses
this by targeting the decidability index (d') to enhance distribution
separability, but its reliance on large mini-batches imposes significant
computational constraints. We introduce Proxy-Decidability Loss (PD-Loss), a
novel objective that integrates learnable proxies with the statistical
framework of d' to optimize embedding spaces efficiently. By estimating genuine
and impostor distributions through proxies, PD-Loss combines the computational
efficiency of proxy-based methods with the principled separability of D-Loss,
offering a scalable approach to distribution-aware DML. Experiments across
various tasks, including fine-grained classification and face verification,
demonstrate that PD-Loss achieves performance comparable to that of
state-of-the-art methods while introducing a new perspective on embedding
optimization, with potential for broader applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MLLM系统需要密集像素监督训练，成本高昂且在域外数据上表现不佳。需要一种能够利用基础模型强先验、最小化可训练参数，并能从廉价标注中学习的方法

Method: 多模态大语言模型首先生成任务相关的边界框和正点，然后传递给预训练分割模型作为提示生成最终掩码。使用GRPO强化学习进行优化，仅使用格式奖励和准确性奖励（无掩码监督）

Result: 在域内测试集上提升约4%，在域外基准测试上提升高达54%，证明了模型的鲁棒泛化能力

Conclusion: 复杂的地理空间分割行为可以通过强化学习从弱空间线索中学习，该方法具有强大的泛化性能和实用性

Abstract: Geospatial pixel reasoning is a nascent remote-sensing task that aims to
generate segmentation masks directly from natural-language instructions.
Prevailing MLLM-based systems co-train a language model and a mask decoder with
dense pixel supervision, which is expensive and often weak on out-of-domain
(OOD) data. We introduce GRASP, a structured policy-learning framework. In our
design, a multimodal large language model first emits task-relevant bounding
boxes and positive points from a vision-language instruction. These outputs are
then passed to a pre-trained segmentation model, which consumes them as prompts
to generate the final mask. Instead of supervised fine-tuning, we optimize the
system purely with reinforcement learning: the model is trained solely with
GRPO, guided by format rewards and accuracy rewards computed on boxes and
points (no mask supervision). This leverages strong priors in foundation
models, minimizes trainable parameters, and enables learning from inexpensive
annotations. We additionally curate GRASP-1k, which contains
reasoning-intensive queries, detailed reasoning traces, and fine-grained
segmentation annotations. Evaluations on both in-domain and out-of-domain test
sets show state-of-the-art results: about 4% improvement in-domain and up to
54% on OOD benchmarks. The experiment results evidence our model's robust
generalization and demonstrate that complex geospatial segmentation behaviors
can be learned via RL from weak spatial cues. Code and the dataset will be
released open-source.

Motivation: 现有AI诊断模型在低资源地区泛化能力不足且计算需求高，无法满足甘蔗农民的实时诊断需求

Method: 构建包含638张图像的甘蔗叶病数据集，结合迁移学习和贝叶斯优化开发轻量级SugarcaneShuffleNet模型，并集成到渐进式Web应用中

Result: SugarcaneShuffleNet模型仅9.26MB，达到98.02%准确率和4.14ms推理速度，在资源效率上优于其他轻量模型

Conclusion: 该研究为低资源环境提供了实用的甘蔗疾病分类工具，具有高精度、快速推理和可解释性的特点

Abstract: Despite progress in AI-based plant diagnostics, sugarcane farmers in
low-resource regions remain vulnerable to leaf diseases due to the lack of
scalable, efficient, and interpretable tools. Many deep learning models fail to
generalize under real-world conditions and require substantial computational
resources, limiting their use in resource-constrained regions. In this paper,
we present SugarcaneLD-BD, a curated dataset for sugarcane leaf-disease
classification; SugarcaneShuffleNet, an optimized lightweight model for rapid
on-device diagnosis; and SugarcaneAI, a Progressive Web Application for field
deployment. SugarcaneLD-BD contains 638 curated images across five classes,
including four major sugarcane diseases, collected in Bangladesh under diverse
field conditions and verified by expert pathologists. To enhance diversity, we
combined SugarcaneLD-BD with two additional datasets, yielding a larger and
more representative corpus. Our optimized model, SugarcaneShuffleNet, offers
the best trade-off between speed and accuracy for real-time, on-device
diagnosis. This 9.26 MB model achieved 98.02% accuracy, an F1-score of 0.98,
and an average inference time of 4.14 ms per image. For comparison, we
fine-tuned five other lightweight convolutional neural networks: MnasNet,
EdgeNeXt, EfficientNet-Lite, MobileNet, and SqueezeNet via transfer learning
and Bayesian optimization. MnasNet and EdgeNeXt achieved comparable accuracy to
SugarcaneShuffleNet, but required significantly more parameters, memory, and
computation, limiting their suitability for low-resource deployment. We
integrate SugarcaneShuffleNet into SugarcaneAI, delivering Grad-CAM-based
explanations in the field. Together, these contributions offer a diverse
benchmark, efficient models for low-resource environments, and a practical tool
for sugarcane disease classification. It spans varied lighting, backgrounds and
devices used on-farm

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CE-RS-SBCIT的新型混合框架，结合残差空间学习CNN和Transformer模块，用于脑肿瘤MRI图像的准确分类，在多个数据集上达到98%以上的性能指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑肿瘤是致命疾病，早期检测和准确分类对诊疗至关重要。传统CNN和Transformer存在计算成本高、对微小对比度变化敏感、结构异质性和纹理不一致等挑战。

Method: 集成残差空间学习CNN与Transformer驱动模块，包含四个核心创新：SBCIT（平滑边界CNN集成Transformer）、定制残差空间学习CNN、通道增强策略、新型空间注意力机制。

Result: 在Kaggle和Figshare的MRI数据集上评估，涵盖胶质瘤、脑膜瘤、垂体瘤和健康对照，达到98.30%准确率、98.08%灵敏度、98.25% F1分数和98.43%精确度。

Conclusion: CE-RS-SBCIT框架通过整合局部细粒度和全局上下文特征，有效解决了脑肿瘤MRI分类中的挑战，展现了卓越的分类性能。

Abstract: Brain tumors remain among the most lethal human diseases, where early
detection and accurate classification are critical for effective diagnosis and
treatment planning. Although deep learning-based computer-aided diagnostic
(CADx) systems have shown remarkable progress. However, conventional
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers face persistent
challenges, including high computational cost, sensitivity to minor contrast
variations, structural heterogeneity, and texture inconsistencies in MRI data.
Therefore, a novel hybrid framework, CE-RS-SBCIT, is introduced, integrating
residual and spatial learning-based CNNs with transformer-driven modules. The
proposed framework exploits local fine-grained and global contextual cues
through four core innovations: (i) a smoothing and boundary-based
CNN-integrated Transformer (SBCIT), (ii) tailored residual and spatial learning
CNNs, (iii) a channel enhancement (CE) strategy, and (iv) a novel spatial
attention mechanism. The developed SBCIT employs stem convolution and
contextual interaction transformer blocks with systematic smoothing and
boundary operations, enabling efficient global feature modeling. Moreover,
Residual and spatial CNNs, enhanced by auxiliary transfer-learned feature maps,
enrich the representation space, while the CE module amplifies discriminative
channels and mitigates redundancy. Furthermore, the spatial attention mechanism
selectively emphasizes subtle contrast and textural variations across tumor
classes. Extensive evaluation on challenging MRI datasets from Kaggle and
Figshare, encompassing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, and healthy
controls, demonstrates superior performance, achieving 98.30% accuracy, 98.08%
sensitivity, 98.25% F1-score, and 98.43% precision.

Traditional assessment methods are often labor-intensive, costly, and hazardous
to personnel, making them impractical for rapid response, especially in
resource-limited settings. This study proposes a novel, cost-effective
framework that leverages aerial drone footage, an advanced AI-based video
super-resolution model, Video Restoration Transformer (VRT), and Gemma3:27b, a

Abstract: Traditional video-based learning remains passive, offering limited
opportunities for users to engage dynamically with content. While current
AI-powered tools offer transcription and summarization, they lack real-time,
region-specific interaction capabilities. This paper introduces Untwist, an
AI-driven system that enables interactive video learning by allowing users to
ask questions about the entire video or specific regions using a bounding box,
receiving context-aware, multimodal responses. By integrating GPT APIs with
Computer Vision techniques, Untwist extracts, processes, and structures video
content to enhance comprehension. Our approach addresses GPT-4o spatial
weakness by leveraging annotated frames instead of raw coordinate data,
significantly improving accuracy in localizing and interpreting video content.
This paper describes the system architecture, including video pre-processing
and real-time interaction, and outlines how Untwist can transform passive video
consumption into an interactive, AI-driven learning experience with the
potential to enhance engagement and comprehension.

Motivation: 由于T2加权MRI的各向异性分辨率限制，难以准确提取内侧颞叶皮质亚区厚度，需要开发更精确的成像生物标志物提取方法

Result: 在独立测试集中，使用各向同性模型提取的皮质亚区厚度在区分轻度认知障碍和认知正常参与者方面比各向异性方法显示出更高的显著性；在纵向分析中，各向同性方法提取的生物标志物在认知正常参与者中表现出更好的稳定性

Conclusion: 该方法在不增加图谱标注工作量的情况下提高了AD成像生物标志物的准确性，有助于更精确地量化AD与脑萎缩的关系，为疾病追踪提供更准确的测量指标

Abstract: Imaging biomarkers in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are important tools
for diagnosing and tracking Alzheimer's disease (AD). As medial temporal lobe
(MTL) is the earliest region to show AD-related hallmarks, brain atrophy caused
by AD can first be observed in the MTL. Accurate segmentation of MTL subregions
and extraction of imaging biomarkers from them are important. However, due to
imaging limitations, the resolution of T2-weighted (T2w) MRI is anisotropic,
which makes it difficult to accurately extract the thickness of cortical
subregions in the MTL. In this study, we used an implicit neural representation
method to combine the resolution advantages of T1-weighted and T2w MRI to
accurately upsample an MTL subregion atlas set from anisotropic space to
isotropic space, establishing a multi-modality, high-resolution atlas set.
Based on this atlas, we developed an isotropic MTL subregion segmentation
model. In an independent test set, the cortical subregion thickness extracted
using this isotropic model showed higher significance than an anisotropic
method in distinguishing between participants with mild cognitive impairment
and cognitively unimpaired (CU) participants. In longitudinal analysis, the
biomarkers extracted using isotropic method showed greater stability in CU
participants. This study improved the accuracy of AD imaging biomarkers without
increasing the amount of atlas annotation work, which may help to more
accurately quantify the relationship between AD and brain atrophy and provide
more accurate measures for disease tracking.

Conclusion: AdvCP方法有效解决了弱监督变化检测中的共现噪声问题，无需额外推理成本，具有很好的通用性

Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Change Detection (WSCD) aims to distinguish specific object
changes (e.g., objects appearing or disappearing) from background variations
(e.g., environmental changes due to light, weather, or seasonal shifts) in
paired satellite images, relying only on paired image (i.e., image-level)
classification labels. This technique significantly reduces the need for dense
annotations required in fully-supervised change detection. However, as
image-level supervision only indicates whether objects have changed in a scene,
WSCD methods often misclassify background variations as object changes,
especially in complex remote-sensing scenarios. In this work, we propose an
Adversarial Class Prompting (AdvCP) method to address this co-occurring noise
problem, including two phases: a) Adversarial Prompt Mining: After each
training iteration, we introduce adversarial prompting perturbations, using
incorrect one-hot image-level labels to activate erroneous feature mappings.
This process reveals co-occurring adversarial samples under weak supervision,
namely background variation features that are likely to be misclassified as
object changes. b) Adversarial Sample Rectification: We integrate these
adversarially prompt-activated pixel samples into training by constructing an
online global prototype. This prototype is built from an exponentially weighted
moving average of the current batch and all historical training data. Our AdvCP
can be seamlessly integrated into current WSCD methods without adding
additional inference cost. Experiments on ConvNet, Transformer, and Segment
Anything Model (SAM)-based baselines demonstrate significant performance
enhancements. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of AdvCP to
other multi-class weakly-supervised dense prediction scenarios. Code is

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel cover image generation task that produces
both a concise summary and a visually corresponding image from a given
text-only document. Because no existing datasets are available for this task,
we propose a multimodal pseudo-labeling method to construct high-quality
datasets at low cost. We first collect documents that contain multiple images
with their captions, and their summaries by excluding factually inconsistent
instances. Our approach selects one image from the multiple images accompanying
the documents. Using the gold summary, we independently rank both the images
and their captions. Then, we annotate a pseudo-label for an image when both the
image and its corresponding caption are ranked first in their respective
rankings. Finally, we remove documents that contain direct image references
within texts. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed multimodal
pseudo-labeling method constructs more precise datasets and generates higher
quality images than text- and image-only pseudo-labeling methods, which
consider captions and images separately. We release our code at:

Abstract: This paper introduces a multi-agent framework for comprehensive highway scene
understanding, designed around a mixture-of-experts strategy. In this
framework, a large generic vision-language model (VLM), such as GPT-4o, is
contextualized with domain knowledge to generates task-specific
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts. These fine-grained prompts are then used to
guide a smaller, efficient VLM (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) in reasoning over short
videos, along with complementary modalities as applicable. The framework
simultaneously addresses multiple critical perception tasks, including weather
classification, pavement wetness assessment, and traffic congestion detection,
achieving robust multi-task reasoning while balancing accuracy and
computational efficiency. To support empirical validation, we curated three
specialized datasets aligned with these tasks. Notably, the pavement wetness
dataset is multimodal, combining video streams with road weather sensor data,
highlighting the benefits of multimodal reasoning. Experimental results
demonstrate consistently strong performance across diverse traffic and
environmental conditions. From a deployment perspective, the framework can be
readily integrated with existing traffic camera systems and strategically
applied to high-risk rural locations, such as sharp curves, flood-prone
lowlands, or icy bridges. By continuously monitoring the targeted sites, the
system enhances situational awareness and delivers timely alerts, even in
resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: 通过多模态知识分解和在线萌化技术，在训练中利用配对的基因组-病理数据，但推理时只需病理切片数据即可完成IHC生物标记物预测，解决了多模态数据同时获取难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态数据融合可以提升IHC生物标记物预测性能，但基因组和病理学等多模态数据的同时获取存在成本高或技术限制。需要一种方法在训练阶段利用多模态数据优势，但在推理时只需单一模态数据即可进行预测。

Result: 在TCGA-BRCA和内部QHSU数据集上的实验表明，该方法在使用单一模态数据进行IHC生物标记物预测时达到了更优的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的MKD方法有效地解决了多模态数据获取难的问题，在训练阶段充分利用多模态数据优势，而在推理时只需单一模态数据即可实现高性能的IHC生物标记物预测，为病理图像分析预测提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarker prediction benefits from multi-modal data
fusion analysis. However, the simultaneous acquisition of multi-modal data,
such as genomic and pathological information, is often challenging due to cost
or technical limitations. To address this challenge, we propose an online
distillation approach based on Multi-modal Knowledge Decomposition (MKD) to
enhance IHC biomarker prediction in haematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) stained
histopathology images. This method leverages paired genomic-pathology data
during training while enabling inference using either pathology slides alone or
both modalities. Two teacher and one student models are developed to extract
modality-specific and modality-general features by minimizing the MKD loss. To
maintain the internal structural relationships between samples,
Similarity-preserving Knowledge Distillation (SKD) is applied. Additionally,
Collaborative Learning for Online Distillation (CLOD) facilitates mutual
learning between teacher and student models, encouraging diverse and
complementary learning dynamics. Experiments on the TCGA-BRCA and in-house QHSU
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in IHC
biomarker prediction using uni-modal data. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 深度学习框架通过在VGG19中添加多头自注意力块和Focal Loss捐失函数，实现了自动化急性枝B细胞白血病诊断，达到99.25%的高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的急性枝B细胞白血病(ALL)诊断流程复杂耗时且容易出错，需要一种准确高效的自动化诊断方案来指导治疗。

Method: 结合稳健的图像预处理流水线和卷积神经网络(CNNs)，在VGG19基础网络中插入多头自注意力(MHSA)块来建模细胞特征间的长程依赖关系，使用Focal Loss来缓解类别不平衡问题。

Result: 增强型VGG19+MHSA网络在Focal Loss训练下达到99.25%的准确率，超越了ResNet101基准模型(98.62%)。

Conclusion: 注意力增强的卷积神经网络结合有针对性的捐失优化和预处理，能够产生更具医别性的白血病细胞形态表征，为临床诊断提供了高效准确的自动化工具。

Abstract: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a prevalent hematological malignancy in
both pediatric and adult populations. Early and accurate detection with precise
subtyping is essential for guiding therapy. Conventional workflows are complex,
time-consuming, and prone to human error. We present a deep learning framework
for automated ALL diagnosis from bone marrow smear images. The method combines
a robust preprocessing pipeline with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to
standardize image quality and improve inference efficiency. As a key design, we
insert a multi-head self-attention (MHSA) block into a VGG19 backbone to model
long-range dependencies and contextual relationships among cellular features.
To mitigate class imbalance, we train with Focal Loss. Across evaluated
architectures, the enhanced VGG19+MHSA trained with Focal Loss achieves 99.25%
accuracy, surpassing a strong ResNet101 baseline (98.62%). These results
indicate that attention-augmented CNNs, coupled with targeted loss optimization
and preprocessing, yield more discriminative representations of leukemic cell
morphology. Our approach offers a highly accurate and computationally efficient
tool for automated ALL recognition and subtyping, with potential to accelerate
diagnostic workflows and support reliable decision-making in clinical settings.

TL;DR: FVP是一个新颖的4D视觉预训练框架，通过点云预测扩散模型提升3D表示性能，在12个真实世界操作任务中将3D扩散策略的成功率平均提升28%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉预训练表示主要基于2D图像，忽略了世界的3D本质，但由于大规模3D数据稀缺，难以从网络数据中提取通用3D表示

Method: 将视觉预训练目标构建为下一个点云预测问题，使用扩散模型建模预测模型，直接在大型公共数据集上进行预训练

Result: 在12个真实世界操作任务中，FVP将3D扩散策略的平均成功率提升28%，达到模仿学习方法的最先进性能，并适用于各种点云编码器和数据集

Conclusion: FVP框架有效提升了3D表示性能，可应用于不同模型架构，包括更大的视觉-语言-动作机器人模型，显著增强各种机器人任务的性能

Abstract: General visual representations learned from web-scale datasets for robotics
have achieved great success in recent years, enabling data-efficient robot
learning on manipulation tasks; yet these pre-trained representations are
mostly on 2D images, neglecting the inherent 3D nature of the world. However,
due to the scarcity of large-scale 3D data, it is still hard to extract a
universal 3D representation from web datasets. Instead, we are seeking a
general visual pre-training framework that could improve all 3D representations
as an alternative. Our framework, called FVP, is a novel 4D Visual Pre-training
framework for real-world robot learning. FVP frames the visual pre-training
objective as a next-point-cloud-prediction problem, models the prediction model
as a diffusion model, and pre-trains the model on the larger public datasets
directly. Across twelve real-world manipulation tasks, FVP boosts the average
success rate of 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3) for these tasks by 28%. The FVP
pre-trained DP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance across imitation learning
methods. Moreover, the efficacy of FVP adapts across various point cloud
encoders and datasets. Finally, we apply FVP to the RDT-1B, a larger
Vision-Language-Action robotic model, enhancing its performance on various
robot tasks. Our project page is available at: https://4d-

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PersPose是一个新颖的单目3D人体姿态估计框架，通过透视编码和透视旋转技术解决裁剪图像中相机内参缺失和透视失真问题，在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D人体姿态估计方法通常只使用裁剪后的图像作为输入，但缺少相机内参信息导致无法准确估计关节的相对深度，且人体偏离图像中心会导致透视失真，增加了模型拟合难度。

Method: 提出PersPose框架：1) 透视编码(PE)编码裁剪图像的相机内参；2) 透视旋转(PR)将原始图像中的人体中心化，减少透视失真；3) 结合PE和PR构建完整的3D姿态估计框架。

Result: 在3DPW、MPI-INF-3DHP和Human3.6M数据集上达到state-of-the-art性能。在3DPW数据集上MPJPE为60.1mm，比之前SOTA方法降低了7.54%。

Conclusion: PersPose通过有效处理相机内参和透视失真问题，显著提升了单目3D人体姿态估计的精度，特别是在野外场景下的性能表现优异。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE) methods estimate the 3D positions of
joints from individual images. Existing 3D HPE approaches often use the cropped
image alone as input for their models. However, the relative depths of joints
cannot be accurately estimated from cropped images without the corresponding
camera intrinsics, which determine the perspective relationship between 3D
objects and the cropped images. In this work, we introduce Perspective Encoding
(PE) to encode the camera intrinsics of the cropped images. Moreover, since the
human subject can appear anywhere within the original image, the perspective
relationship between the 3D scene and the cropped image differs significantly,
which complicates model fitting. Additionally, the further the human subject
deviates from the image center, the greater the perspective distortions in the
cropped image. To address these issues, we propose Perspective Rotation (PR), a
transformation applied to the original image that centers the human subject,
thereby reducing perspective distortions and alleviating the difficulty of
model fitting. By incorporating PE and PR, we propose a novel 3D HPE framework,
PersPose. Experimental results demonstrate that PersPose achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the 3DPW, MPIINF-3DHP, and Human3.6M
datasets. For example, on the in-the-wild dataset 3DPW, PersPose achieves an
MPJPE of 60.1 mm, 7.54% lower than the previous SOTA approach. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoViPAL是一种层级的上下文视觉token剪枝方法，通过轻量级插件模块在LVLM处理前预测和移除冗余视觉token，显著提升推理效率而不损失精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型处理图像时会产生大量视觉token，导致计算成本高和内存开销大。现有剪枝方法在浅层缺乏足够上下文信息时效果不佳，但许多视觉token在浅层就存在固有冗余性。

Method: 提出CoViPAL方法，使用即插即用剪枝模块(PPM)在LVLM处理前预测和移除冗余视觉token。PPM轻量级、模型无关，可无缝集成到各种模型中。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，CoViPAL在相同token预算下优于无训练剪枝方法，在可比监督下超越基于训练的方法，显著提升推理效率。

Conclusion: CoViPAL为LVLM提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案，在不影响准确性的前提下显著提升推理效率。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) process multimodal inputs consisting of
text tokens and vision tokens extracted from images or videos. Due to the rich
visual information, a single image can generate thousands of vision tokens,
leading to high computational costs during the prefilling stage and significant
memory overhead during decoding. Existing methods attempt to prune redundant
vision tokens, revealing substantial redundancy in visual representations.
However, these methods often struggle in shallow layers due to the lack of
sufficient contextual information. We argue that many visual tokens are
inherently redundant even in shallow layers and can be safely and effectively
pruned with appropriate contextual signals. In this work, we propose CoViPAL, a
layer-wise contextualized visual token pruning method that employs a
Plug-and-Play Pruning Module (PPM) to predict and remove redundant vision
tokens before they are processed by the LVLM. The PPM is lightweight,
model-agnostic, and operates independently of the LVLM architecture, ensuring
seamless integration with various models. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that CoViPAL outperforms training-free pruning methods
under equal token budgets and surpasses training-based methods with comparable
supervision. CoViPAL offers a scalable and efficient solution to improve
inference efficiency in LVLMs without compromising accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文首次定义了多重嵌入攻击(MEA)，并提出对抗干扰模拟(AIS)训练范式来增强现有深度伪造主动取证方法的鲁棒性，使其在遭受多次水印嵌入后仍能正确提取原始水印。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度伪造技术的发展，个人隐私面临严重威胁。现有的主动取证方法基于单次水印嵌入的理想假设，但在现实场景中图像可能经历多次水印嵌入，导致原始取证水印被破坏，使整个主动取证机制失效。

Method: 提出对抗干扰模拟(AIS)训练范式，在微调过程中显式模拟MEA场景，并引入韧性驱动的损失函数来学习稀疏且稳定的水印表示，而不需要修改网络架构。

Result: 大量实验表明，AIS训练范式显著增强了各种现有方法对MEA的鲁棒性，使模型在经历第二次水印嵌入后仍能正确提取原始水印。

Conclusion: AIS作为一种即插即用的训练范式，有效解决了多重嵌入攻击问题，提升了深度伪造主动取证方法在实际应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of deepfake technologies and the wide dissemination
of digital media, personal privacy is facing increasingly serious security
threats. Deepfake proactive forensics, which involves embedding imperceptible
watermarks to enable reliable source tracking, serves as a crucial defense
against these threats. Although existing methods show strong forensic ability,
they rely on an idealized assumption of single watermark embedding, which
proves impractical in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we formally define
and demonstrate the existence of Multi-Embedding Attacks (MEA) for the first
time. When a previously protected image undergoes additional rounds of
watermark embedding, the original forensic watermark can be destroyed or
removed, rendering the entire proactive forensic mechanism ineffective. To
address this vulnerability, we propose a general training paradigm named
Adversarial Interference Simulation (AIS). Rather than modifying the network
architecture, AIS explicitly simulates MEA scenarios during fine-tuning and
introduces a resilience-driven loss function to enforce the learning of sparse
and stable watermark representations. Our method enables the model to maintain
the ability to extract the original watermark correctly even after a second
embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our plug-and-play AIS
training paradigm significantly enhances the robustness of various existing
methods against MEA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在现实任务中表现优异，但无法像人类一样感知错视轮廓（如abutting grating），这种感知差异阻碍了机器智能与人类认知的对齐

Method: 提出ICPNet网络，包含：1）多尺度特征投影模块提取多尺度表征；2）特征交互注意力模块增强前馈和反馈特征交互；3）边缘融合模块通过边缘检测任务注入形状约束，引导网络关注前景

Result: 在AG-MNIST和AG-Fashion-MNIST测试集上，ICPNet对错视轮廓的敏感性显著优于现有最优模型，在各子集上的top-1准确率均有显著提升

Conclusion: 该工作向基于DNN的模型实现人类水平智能迈出了一步，通过模拟视觉皮层回路解决了DNN与人类感知模式的对齐问题

Abstract: Higher levels of machine intelligence demand alignment with human perception
and cognition. Deep neural networks (DNN) dominated machine intelligence have
demonstrated exceptional performance across various real-world tasks.
Nevertheless, recent evidence suggests that DNNs fail to perceive illusory
contours like the abutting grating, a discrepancy that misaligns with human
perception patterns. Departing from previous works, we propose a novel deep
network called illusory contour perception network (ICPNet) inspired by the
circuits of the visual cortex. In ICPNet, a multi-scale feature projection
(MFP) module is designed to extract multi-scale representations. To boost the
interaction between feedforward and feedback features, a feature interaction
attention module (FIAM) is introduced. Moreover, drawing inspiration from the
shape bias observed in human perception, an edge detection task conducted via
the edge fusion module (EFM) injects shape constraints that guide the network
to concentrate on the foreground. We assess our method on the existing AG-MNIST
test set and the AG-Fashion-MNIST test sets constructed by this work.
Comprehensive experimental results reveal that ICPNet is significantly more
sensitive to abutting grating illusory contours than state-of-the-art models,
with notable improvements in top-1 accuracy across various subsets. This work
is expected to make a step towards human-level intelligence for DNN-based
models.

Conclusion: 该框架为基于LLM的AR推荐在自我中心驾驶场景中的研究提供了有效基础，是这一方向的先驱探索，代码和数据集将开源以促进未来研究。

Abstract: We present SEER-VAR, a novel framework for egocentric vehicle-based augmented
reality (AR) that unifies semantic decomposition, Context-Aware SLAM Branches
(CASB), and LLM-driven recommendation. Unlike existing systems that assume
static or single-view settings, SEER-VAR dynamically separates cabin and road
scenes via depth-guided vision-language grounding. Two SLAM branches track
egocentric motion in each context, while a GPT-based module generates
context-aware overlays such as dashboard cues and hazard alerts. To support
evaluation, we introduce EgoSLAM-Drive, a real-world dataset featuring
synchronized egocentric views, 6DoF ground-truth poses, and AR annotations
across diverse driving scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that SEER-VAR
achieves robust spatial alignment and perceptually coherent AR rendering across
varied environments. As one of the first to explore LLM-based AR recommendation
in egocentric driving, we address the lack of comparable systems through
structured prompting and detailed user studies. Results show that SEER-VAR
enhances perceived scene understanding, overlay relevance, and driver ease,
providing an effective foundation for future research in this direction. Code

Abstract: Identifying quantum flakes is crucial for scalable quantum hardware; however,
automated layer classification from optical microscopy remains challenging due
to substantial appearance shifts across different materials. In this paper, we
propose a new Continual-Learning Framework for Flake Layer Classification
(CLIFF). To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of continual
learning in the domain of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Our method enables
the model to differentiate between materials and their physical and optical
properties by freezing a backbone and base head trained on a reference
material. For each new material, it learns a material-specific prompt,
embedding, and a delta head. A prompt pool and a cosine-similarity gate
modulate features and compute material-specific corrections. Additionally, we
incorporate memory replay with knowledge distillation. CLIFF achieves
competitive accuracy with significantly lower forgetting than naive fine-tuning
and a prompt-based baseline.

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和TinyImageNet数据集上实验表明，适当调整引导模型在一定精度范围内可增强目标模型对各种对抗攻击的鲁棒性

Conclusion: AdaGAT方法通过动态调整引导模型训练状态，有效提升了目标模型的对抗鲁棒性能，优于多种基线模型

Abstract: Adversarial distillation (AD) is a knowledge distillation technique that
facilitates the transfer of robustness from teacher deep neural network (DNN)
models to lightweight target (student) DNN models, enabling the target models
to perform better than only training the student model independently. Some
previous works focus on using a small, learnable teacher (guide) model to
improve the robustness of a student model. Since a learnable guide model starts
learning from scratch, maintaining its optimal state for effective knowledge
transfer during co-training is challenging. Therefore, we propose a novel
Adaptive Guidance Adversarial Training (AdaGAT) method. Our method, AdaGAT,
dynamically adjusts the training state of the guide model to install robustness
to the target model. Specifically, we develop two separate loss functions as
part of the AdaGAT method, allowing the guide model to participate more
actively in backpropagation to achieve its optimal state. We evaluated our
approach via extensive experiments on three datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
TinyImageNet, using the WideResNet-34-10 model as the target model. Our
observations reveal that appropriately adjusting the guide model within a
certain accuracy range enhances the target model's robustness across various
adversarial attacks compared to a variety of baseline models.

Abstract: Sarcopenia is a progressive loss of muscle mass and function linked to poor
surgical outcomes such as prolonged hospital stays, impaired mobility, and
increased mortality. Although it can be assessed through cross-sectional
imaging by measuring skeletal muscle area (SMA), the process is time-consuming
and adds to clinical workloads, limiting timely detection and management;
however, this process could become more efficient and scalable with the
assistance of artificial intelligence applications. This paper presents
high-quality three-dimensional cross-sectional computed tomography (CT) images
of patients with sarcopenia collected at the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon
Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Expert clinicians manually annotated the
SMA at the third lumbar vertebra, generating precise segmentation masks. We
develop deep-learning models to measure SMA in CT images and automate this
task. Our methodology employed transfer learning and self-supervised learning
approaches using labelled and unlabeled CT scan datasets. While we developed
qualitative assessment models for detecting sarcopenia, we observed that the
quantitative assessment of SMA is more precise and informative. This approach
also mitigates the issue of class imbalance and limited data availability. Our
model predicted the SMA, on average, with an error of +-3 percentage points
against the manually measured SMA. The average dice similarity coefficient of
the predicted masks was 93%. Our results, therefore, show a pathway to full
automation of sarcopenia assessment and detection.

*Ruichao Hou,Boyue Xu,Tongwei Ren,Gangshan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的模态感知跟踪器MTNet，通过通道聚合分布模块和空间相似性感知模块探索模态特定线索，使用Transformer融合网络捕获全局依赖关系，并采用三叉预测头和动态更新策略实现精确跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 常规的融合范式和不变的跟踪模板限制了RGB-T跟踪中的特征交互能力，需要学习更鲁棒的多模态表示。

Method: 提出MTNet跟踪器，包含模态感知网络（CADM和SSPM模块）、Transformer融合网络、三叉预测头和动态更新策略。

Result: 在三个RGB-T基准测试中达到了与最先进方法相媲美的满意结果，同时实现了实时速度。

Conclusion: 该方法通过模态感知和Transformer融合有效提升了RGB-T跟踪性能，在精度和效率方面都表现出色。

Abstract: The ability to learn robust multi-modality representation has played a
critical role in the development of RGBT tracking. However, the regular fusion
paradigm and the invariable tracking template remain restrictive to the feature
interaction. In this paper, we propose a modality-aware tracker based on
transformer, termed MTNet. Specifically, a modality-aware network is presented
to explore modality-specific cues, which contains both channel aggregation and
distribution module(CADM) and spatial similarity perception module (SSPM). A
transformer fusion network is then applied to capture global dependencies to
reinforce instance representations. To estimate the precise location and tackle
the challenges, such as scale variation and deformation, we design a trident
prediction head and a dynamic update strategy which jointly maintain a reliable
template for facilitating inter-frame communication. Extensive experiments
validate that the proposed method achieves satisfactory results compared with
the state-of-the-art competitors on three RGBT benchmarks while reaching
real-time speed.

TL;DR: QTT-SEG是一个基于元学习的自动化SAM模型微调方法，通过快速超参数优化框架在短时间内找到高性能配置，显著提升了SAM在特定领域图像分割任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型如SAM在零样本图像分割方面表现优异，但在特定领域任务中表现不足。传统微调方法需要大量人工努力和领域专业知识，因此需要自动化且高效的微调方法。

Abstract: Foundation models like SAM (Segment Anything Model) exhibit strong zero-shot
image segmentation performance, but often fall short on domain-specific tasks.
Fine-tuning these models typically requires significant manual effort and
domain expertise. In this work, we introduce QTT-SEG, a meta-learning-driven
approach for automating and accelerating the fine-tuning of SAM for image
segmentation. Built on the Quick-Tune hyperparameter optimization framework,
QTT-SEG predicts high-performing configurations using meta-learned cost and
performance models, efficiently navigating a search space of over 200 million
possibilities. We evaluate QTT-SEG on eight binary and five multiclass
segmentation datasets under tight time constraints. Our results show that
QTT-SEG consistently improves upon SAM's zero-shot performance and surpasses
AutoGluon Multimodal, a strong AutoML baseline, on most binary tasks within
three minutes. On multiclass datasets, QTT-SEG delivers consistent gains as
well. These findings highlight the promise of meta-learning in automating model
adaptation for specialized segmentation tasks. Code available at:

Abstract: Compositional visual reasoning has emerged as a key research frontier in
multimodal AI, aiming to endow machines with the human-like ability to
decompose visual scenes, ground intermediate concepts, and perform multi-step
logical inference. While early surveys focus on monolithic vision-language
models or general multimodal reasoning, a dedicated synthesis of the rapidly
expanding compositional visual reasoning literature is still missing. We fill
this gap with a comprehensive survey spanning 2023 to 2025 that systematically
reviews 260+ papers from top venues (CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, ICML, ACL, etc.). We
first formalize core definitions and describe why compositional approaches
offer advantages in cognitive alignment, semantic fidelity, robustness,
interpretability, and data efficiency. Next, we trace a five-stage paradigm
shift: from prompt-enhanced language-centric pipelines, through tool-enhanced
LLMs and tool-enhanced VLMs, to recently minted chain-of-thought reasoning and
unified agentic VLMs, highlighting their architectural designs, strengths, and
limitations. We then catalog 60+ benchmarks and corresponding metrics that
probe compositional visual reasoning along dimensions such as grounding
accuracy, chain-of-thought faithfulness, and high-resolution perception.
Drawing on these analyses, we distill key insights, identify open challenges
(e.g., limitations of LLM-based reasoning, hallucination, a bias toward
deductive reasoning, scalable supervision, tool integration, and benchmark
limitations), and outline future directions, including world-model integration,
human-AI collaborative reasoning, and richer evaluation protocols. By offering
a unified taxonomy, historical roadmap, and critical outlook, this survey aims
to serve as a foundational reference and inspire the next generation of
compositional visual reasoning research.

*Zhihao Chen,Qi Gao,Zilong Li,Junping Zhang,Yi Zhang,Jun Zhao,Hongming Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoundDiff是一个基础扩散模型，通过两阶段策略（剂量-解剖感知和自适应去噪）实现跨不同剂量水平和解剖区域的统一低剂量CT去噪，在泛化性和性能上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的低剂量CT去噪方法通常在特定剂量水平和解剖区域训练，难以处理不同扫描条件下的噪声特性和解剖异质性，限制了在临床场景中的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Method: 采用两阶段策略：1）开发剂量-解剖感知对比语言图像预训练模型(DA-CLIP)，通过对比学习学习连续表示来量化剂量变化和识别解剖区域；2）设计剂量-解剖感知扩散模型(DA-Diff)，通过基于Mamba的剂量解剖条件块(DACB)将学习到的嵌入整合到扩散过程中。

Result: 在两个公共低剂量CT数据集上的广泛实验表明，FoundDiff在八个剂量水平和三个解剖区域上表现出优于现有最先进方法的去噪性能，并对未见过的剂量水平具有显著的泛化能力。

Conclusion: FoundDiff提供了一个统一且可泛化的低剂量CT去噪解决方案，能够有效处理不同剂量水平和解剖区域的多样性，在临床应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (CT) denoising is crucial for reduced radiation
exposure while ensuring diagnostically acceptable image quality. Despite
significant advancements driven by deep learning (DL) in recent years, existing
DL-based methods, typically trained on a specific dose level and anatomical
region, struggle to handle diverse noise characteristics and anatomical
heterogeneity during varied scanning conditions, limiting their
generalizability and robustness in clinical scenarios. In this paper, we
propose FoundDiff, a foundational diffusion model for unified and generalizable
LDCT denoising across various dose levels and anatomical regions. FoundDiff
employs a two-stage strategy: (i) dose-anatomy perception and (ii) adaptive
denoising. First, we develop a dose- and anatomy-aware contrastive language
image pre-training model (DA-CLIP) to achieve robust dose and anatomy
perception by leveraging specialized contrastive learning strategies to learn
continuous representations that quantify ordinal dose variations and identify
salient anatomical regions. Second, we design a dose- and anatomy-aware
diffusion model (DA-Diff) to perform adaptive and generalizable denoising by
synergistically integrating the learned dose and anatomy embeddings from DACLIP
into diffusion process via a novel dose and anatomy conditional block (DACB)
based on Mamba. Extensive experiments on two public LDCT datasets encompassing
eight dose levels and three anatomical regions demonstrate superior denoising
performance of FoundDiff over existing state-of-the-art methods and the
remarkable generalization to unseen dose levels. The codes and models are
available at https://github.com/hao1635/FoundDiff.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PosBridge是一个无需训练的局部图像编辑框架，通过位置嵌入移植技术将用户指定对象无缝插入目标场景，在保持结构一致性和外观保真度方面优于主流方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型规模扩大，训练成本急剧增加，需要开发无需训练且可扩展的图像编辑框架来实现定制化对象的精准插入。

Method: 采用位置嵌入移植技术指导扩散模型复制参考对象的结构特征，结合角点中心布局将参考图像和背景图像拼接输入FLUX.1-Fill模型，在渐进去噪过程中引导目标区域的噪声分布。

Result: 大量实验表明，PosBridge在结构一致性、外观保真度和计算效率方面均优于主流基线方法。

Conclusion: PosBridge展示了实际应用价值和广泛采用的潜力，为无需训练的定制化图像编辑提供了高效灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Localized subject-driven image editing aims to seamlessly integrate
user-specified objects into target scenes. As generative models continue to
scale, training becomes increasingly costly in terms of memory and computation,
highlighting the need for training-free and scalable editing frameworks.To this
end, we propose PosBridge an efficient and flexible framework for inserting
custom objects. A key component of our method is positional embedding
transplant, which guides the diffusion model to faithfully replicate the
structural characteristics of reference objects.Meanwhile, we introduce the
Corner Centered Layout, which concatenates reference images and the background
image as input to the FLUX.1-Fill model. During progressive denoising,
positional embedding transplant is applied to guide the noise distribution in
the target region toward that of the reference object. In this way, Corner
Centered Layout effectively directs the FLUX.1-Fill model to synthesize
identity-consistent content at the desired location. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PosBridge outperforms mainstream baselines in structural
consistency, appearance fidelity, and computational efficiency, showcasing its
practical value and potential for broad adoption.

*Songliang Cao,Tianqi Hu,Hao Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对小麦植物语义分割竞赛的解决方案，通过专注于茎部细节处理、引入动态上采样器SAPA、半监督引导蒸馏和测试时缩放策略，在MLCAS 2025 GWFSS挑战赛中获得了第一名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前分割技术已经相当成熟，单纯依靠技术技巧难以在竞争中脱颖而出。通过可视化分析发现，小麦茎部具有细粒度结构和像素稀少的特点，容易受到预测不稳定和类别不平衡的影响，因此需要针对茎部特性进行专门优化。

Method: 1) 使用动态上采样器SAPA增强细节描绘；2) 采用半监督引导蒸馏配合茎部感知样本选择，从未标注数据中挖掘有用信息；3) 应用测试时缩放策略，对图像进行放大并两次分割。

Result: 该方法在MLCAS 2025 GWFSS小麦语义分割挑战赛中获得了第一名，明显超越了第二名。

Conclusion: 针对特定问题的本质特性（如小麦茎部的细粒度特征）进行专门优化，比单纯依赖通用分割技巧更能取得竞争优势，即使使用相对简单的改进措施也能获得显著效果。

Abstract: In this report, we present our solution during the participation of the MLCAS
2025 GWFSS Challenge. This challenge hosts a semantic segmentation competition
specific to wheat plants, which requires to segment three wheat organs
including the head, leaf, and stem, and another background class. In 2025,
participating a segmentation competition is significantly different from that
in previous years where many tricks can play important roles. Nowadays most
segmentation tricks have been well integrated into existing codebases such that
our naive ViT-Adapter baseline has already achieved sufficiently good
performance. Hence, we believe the key to stand out among other competitors is
to focus on the problem nature of wheat per se. By probing visualizations, we
identify the key -- the stem matters. In contrast to heads and leaves, stems
exhibit fine structure and occupy only few pixels, which suffers from fragile
predictions and class imbalance. Building on our baseline, we present three
technical improvements tailored to stems: i) incorporating a dynamic upsampler
SAPA used to enhance detail delineation; ii) leveraging semi-supervised guided
distillation with stem-aware sample selection to mine the treasure beneath
unlabeled data; and iii) applying a test-time scaling strategy to zoom in and
segment twice the image. Despite being simple, the three improvements bring us
to the first place of the competition, outperforming the second place by clear
margins. Code and models will be released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake技术的快速发展对社会信任和信息安全构成严重威胁，现有检测方法主要依赖被动分析，难以应对高质量Deepfake内容，需要主动防御手段

Method: 利用人类眼睛对平滑区域扰动更敏感的特性，在低感知显著性的纹理区域插入不可见扰动。使用局部二值模式(LBP)提取纹理特征，采用双模型注意力策略生成和优化纹理扰动

Result: 在CelebA-HQ和LFW数据集上的实验表明，该方法在多种攻击模型下能有效扭曲Deepfake生成并产生明显视觉缺陷

Conclusion: 该方法为主动Deepfake检测提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案，通过纹理引导的扰动框架实现了对Deepfake生成的有效干扰

Abstract: The rapid development of Deepfake technology poses severe challenges to
social trust and information security. While most existing detection methods
primarily rely on passive analyses, due to unresolvable high-quality Deepfake
contents, proactive defense has recently emerged by inserting invisible signals
in advance of image editing. In this paper, we introduce a proactive Deepfake
detection approach based on facial texture features. Since human eyes are more
sensitive to perturbations in smooth regions, we invisibly insert perturbations
within texture regions that have low perceptual saliency, applying localized
perturbations to key texture regions while minimizing unwanted noise in
non-textured areas. Our texture-guided perturbation framework first extracts
preliminary texture features via Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and then
introduces a dual-model attention strategy to generate and optimize texture
perturbations. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW datasets demonstrate the
promising performance of our method in distorting Deepfake generation and
producing obvious visual defects under multiple attack models, providing an
efficient and scalable solution for proactive Deepfake detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统光谱提升方法只能将RGB图像转换为光谱图像，而SpecGen旨在从单张RGB图像生成光谱BRDF，实现任意光照和形状下的光谱图像渲染。主要挑战是测量光谱BRDF数据的稀缺性。

Method: 提出Spectral-Spatial Tri-plane Aggregation (SSTA)网络，建模波长和入射-出射方向的反射响应，利用丰富的RGB BRDF数据训练策略来增强光谱BRDF生成。

Result: 实验表明该方法能从有限光谱数据准确重建光谱BRDF，在高光谱图像重建方面超越最先进方法，PSNR提升8dB。

Conclusion: SpecGen通过创新的SSTA网络和训练策略，成功解决了光谱BRDF数据稀缺问题，实现了高质量的光谱BRDF生成和图像渲染。

Abstract: Synthesizing spectral images across different wavelengths is essential for
photorealistic rendering. Unlike conventional spectral uplifting methods that
convert RGB images into spectral ones, we introduce SpecGen, a novel method
that generates spectral bidirectional reflectance distribution functions
(BRDFs) from a single RGB image of a sphere. This enables spectral image
rendering under arbitrary illuminations and shapes covered by the corresponding
material. A key challenge in spectral BRDF generation is the scarcity of
measured spectral BRDF data. To address this, we propose the Spectral-Spatial
Tri-plane Aggregation (SSTA) network, which models reflectance responses across
wavelengths and incident-outgoing directions, allowing the training strategy to
leverage abundant RGB BRDF data to enhance spectral BRDF generation.
Experiments show that our method accurately reconstructs spectral BRDFs from
limited spectral data and surpasses state-of-the-art methods in hyperspectral
image reconstruction, achieving an improvement of 8 dB in PSNR. Codes and data
will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: We introduce MMCRICBENCH-3K, a benchmark for Visual Question Answering (VQA)
on cricket scorecards, designed to evaluate large vision-language models
(LVLMs) on complex numerical and cross-lingual reasoning over semi-structured

scorecards, and MMCRICBENCH-H-1.5K, containing visually similar Hindi
scorecards, with all questions and answers kept in English to enable controlled
cross-script evaluation. The task demands reasoning over structured numerical

show that even state-of-the-art LVLMs, such as GPT-4o and Qwen2.5VL, struggle
on the English subset despite it being their primary training language and

Conclusion: HiDA-Net能够有效保留原生分辨率细节进行检测，解决了高分辨率AI生成图像检测的挑战

Abstract: The rapid growth of high-resolution, meticulously crafted AI-generated images
poses a significant challenge to existing detection methods, which are often
trained and evaluated on low-resolution, automatically generated datasets that
do not align with the complexities of high-resolution scenarios. A common
practice is to resize or center-crop high-resolution images to fit standard
network inputs. However, without full coverage of all pixels, such strategies
risk either obscuring subtle, high-frequency artifacts or discarding
information from uncovered regions, leading to input information loss. In this
paper, we introduce the High-Resolution Detail-Aggregation Network (HiDA-Net),
a novel framework that ensures no pixel is left behind. We use the Feature
Aggregation Module (FAM), which fuses features from multiple full-resolution
local tiles with a down-sampled global view of the image. These local features
are aggregated and fused with global representations for final prediction,
ensuring that native-resolution details are preserved and utilized for
detection. To enhance robustness against challenges such as localized AI
manipulations and compression, we introduce Token-wise Forgery Localization
(TFL) module for fine-grained spatial sensitivity and JPEG Quality Factor
Estimation (QFE) module to disentangle generative artifacts from compression
noise explicitly. Furthermore, to facilitate future research, we introduce
HiRes-50K, a new challenging benchmark consisting of 50,568 images with up to
64 megapixels. Extensive experiments show that HiDA-Net achieves
state-of-the-art, increasing accuracy by over 13% on the challenging Chameleon

Conclusion: DiCache通过揭示浅层特征差异变化模式与最终输出之间的强相关性，提供了一种统一的自适应缓存框架，有效解决了扩散模型加速中的缓存时机和利用问题。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of acceleration techniques
for diffusion models, especially caching-based acceleration methods. These
studies seek to answer two fundamental questions: "When to cache" and "How to
use cache", typically relying on predefined empirical laws or dataset-level
priors to determine the timing of caching and utilizing handcrafted rules for
leveraging multi-step caches. However, given the highly dynamic nature of the
diffusion process, they often exhibit limited generalizability and fail on
outlier samples. In this paper, a strong correlation is revealed between the
variation patterns of the shallow-layer feature differences in the diffusion
model and those of final model outputs. Moreover, we have observed that the
features from different model layers form similar trajectories. Based on these
observations, we present DiCache, a novel training-free adaptive caching
strategy for accelerating diffusion models at runtime, answering both when and
how to cache within a unified framework. Specifically, DiCache is composed of
two principal components: (1) Online Probe Profiling Scheme leverages a
shallow-layer online probe to obtain a stable prior for the caching error in
real time, enabling the model to autonomously determine caching schedules. (2)
Dynamic Cache Trajectory Alignment combines multi-step caches based on
shallow-layer probe feature trajectory to better approximate the current
feature, facilitating higher visual quality. Extensive experiments validate
DiCache's capability in achieving higher efficiency and improved visual
fidelity over state-of-the-art methods on various leading diffusion models
including WAN 2.1, HunyuanVideo for video generation, and Flux for image
generation.

Abstract: The image-to-image generation task aims to produce controllable images by
leveraging conditional inputs and prompt instructions. However, existing
methods often train separate control branches for each type of condition,
leading to redundant model structures and inefficient use of computational
resources. To address this, we propose a Unified image-to-image Generation
(UniGen) framework that supports diverse conditional inputs while enhancing
generation efficiency and expressiveness. Specifically, to tackle the widely
existing parameter redundancy and computational inefficiency in controllable
conditional generation architectures, we propose the Condition Modulated Expert
(CoMoE) module. This module aggregates semantically similar patch features and
assigns them to dedicated expert modules for visual representation and
conditional modeling. By enabling independent modeling of foreground features
under different conditions, CoMoE effectively mitigates feature entanglement
and redundant computation in multi-condition scenarios. Furthermore, to bridge
the information gap between the backbone and control branches, we propose
WeaveNet, a dynamic, snake-like connection mechanism that enables effective
interaction between global text-level control from the backbone and
fine-grained control from conditional branches. Extensive experiments on the
Subjects-200K and MultiGen-20M datasets across various conditional image
generation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance, validating its advantages in both versatility and
effectiveness. The code has been uploaded to

Method: 开发了一个联合优化多模态检索器和LVLM的模型，仅使用通用骨干网络进行轻量级微调，在医疗多标签分类和视觉问答任务上进行验证。

Result: 模型在医疗诊断任务上达到了与医学预训练模型相当的性能，在具有挑战性的案例中显著优于标准RAG方法。Oracle分析显示正确诊断经常可以通过top检索图像实现，但实际性能与oracle存在较大差距。

Conclusion: 联合检索优化方法有效提升了医疗诊断性能，但当前方法仍与理想性能存在显著差距，为未来方法留下了充足的改进空间。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making often involves interpreting images (e.g., radiology)
for making diagnoses. Retrieving relevant visual information from medical
literature and hospital records could enhance diagnostic accuracy. In this
paper, we develop a model in which a multimodal retriever is jointly optimized
with an LVLM for medical diagnosis, unlike standard RAG where LVLM error signal
is not propagated down to the retriever. We show that using only
general-purpose backbones, with only lightweight fine-tuning, our model is able
to achieve competitive results with medically-pretrained models across clinical
multi-label classification and visual question answering tasks. In a novel
analysis, we additionally find that in many cases different top retrieved
images each lead to different predictions for a given target, and that these
cases are empirically challenging for all models, even for non-retrieval
models. Our joint retrieval optimization significantly improves these
challenging cases over standard RAG. However, oracle analysis reveals that
while the correct diagnosis is frequently achievable using one of the top
retrieved images, in practice there is a large performance gap from the oracle,
and rerankers using frontier LVLMs do not close this gap -- leaving ample room
for improvement by future methods. Code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenging problem of image enhancement in complex
underwater scenes by proposing a solution based on deep learning. The proposed
method skillfully integrates two deep convolutional neural network models,
VGG19 and ResNet50, leveraging their powerful feature extraction capabilities
to perform multi-scale and multi-level deep feature analysis of underwater

effect, this paper introduces image quality assessment metrics such as PSNR,
UCIQE, and UIQM to quantitatively compare images before and after enhancement
and deeply analyzes the performance of different models in different
scenarios.Furthermore, to improve the practicality and stability of the
underwater visual enhancement system, this paper also provides practical
suggestions from aspects such as model optimization, multi-model fusion, and

TL;DR: MoCo提出了一种将人体视频生成解耦为结构生成和外观生成的两阶段方法，通过3D结构生成器首先生成运动序列，然后在结构指导下合成外观，解决了现有方法在全身运动和长距离运动中的一致性问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型过于关注外观保真度，导致人体运动不真实或物理上不合理，缺乏结构一致性。现有数据集主要关注面部或上半身运动，限制了生成方法的适用范围。

Method: 采用两阶段解耦方法：1）使用高效的3D结构生成器从文本提示生成人体运动序列；2）在生成的结构序列指导下合成视频外观。引入Human-Aware Dynamic Control模块和密集跟踪约束来改善稀疏人体结构的细粒度控制。

Result: 大量实验表明，MoCo在生成真实且结构一致的人体视频方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过解耦结构和外观生成，结合新构建的大规模全身人体视频数据集，MoCo能够生成具有复杂多样运动的现实人体视频，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Generating human videos with consistent motion from text prompts remains a
significant challenge, particularly for whole-body or long-range motion.
Existing video generation models prioritize appearance fidelity, resulting in
unrealistic or physically implausible human movements with poor structural
coherence. Additionally, most existing human video datasets primarily focus on
facial or upper-body motions, or consist of vertically oriented dance videos,
limiting the scope of corresponding generation methods to simple movements. To
overcome these challenges, we propose MoCo, which decouples the process of
human video generation into two components: structure generation and appearance
generation. Specifically, our method first employs an efficient 3D structure
generator to produce a human motion sequence from a text prompt. The remaining
video appearance is then synthesized under the guidance of the generated
structural sequence. To improve fine-grained control over sparse human
structures, we introduce Human-Aware Dynamic Control modules and integrate
dense tracking constraints during training. Furthermore, recognizing the
limitations of existing datasets, we construct a large-scale whole-body human
video dataset featuring complex and diverse motions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MoCo outperforms existing approaches in generating realistic
and structurally coherent human videos.

TL;DR: E-BayesSAM是一个高效的贝叶斯SAM框架，通过Token-wise变分贝叶斯推理实现无需训练的贝叶斯适应，结合自优化KAN网络提升可解释性，在超声图像分割中实现实时推理、更高精度和关键token识别


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SAM在医学图像分割中贝叶斯适应的三个关键问题：大型预训练模型贝叶斯微调的不稳定性、计算成本高、以及黑盒设计限制可解释性

Method: 提出E-BayesSAM框架，包含Token-wise变分贝叶斯推理(T-VBI)将输出token重新参数化为潜在变量实现无需训练的贝叶斯适应，以及自优化Kolmogorov-Arnold网络(SO-KAN)通过自监督学习改进token预测和可解释性

Result: 在五个超声数据集上验证：实现实时推理(0.03秒/图像)，分割精度更高(剪枝后DSC 89.0% vs E-BayesSAM 88.0% vs MedSAM 88.3%)，识别出控制SAM决策的四个关键token

Conclusion: E-BayesSAM统一了效率、可靠性和可解释性，将SAM的通用性与临床需求相结合，推动了在安全关键医疗应用中的部署

Abstract: Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has advanced medical image
segmentation, its Bayesian adaptation for uncertainty-aware segmentation
remains hindered by three key issues: (1) instability in Bayesian fine-tuning
of large pre-trained SAMs; (2) high computation cost due to SAM's massive
parameters; (3) SAM's black-box design limits interpretability. To overcome
these, we propose E-BayesSAM, an efficient framework combining Token-wise
Variational Bayesian Inference (T-VBI) for efficienty Bayesian adaptation and
Self-Optimizing Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (SO-KAN) for improving
interpretability. T-VBI innovatively reinterprets SAM's output tokens as
dynamic probabilistic weights and reparameterizes them as latent variables
without auxiliary training, enabling training-free VBI for uncertainty
estimation. SO-KAN improves token prediction with learnable spline activations
via self-supervised learning, providing insight to prune redundant tokens to
boost efficiency and accuracy. Experiments on five ultrasound datasets
demonstrated that E-BayesSAM achieves: (i) real-time inference (0.03s/image),
(ii) superior segmentation accuracy (average DSC: Pruned E-BayesSAM's 89.0\%
vs. E-BayesSAM's 88.0% vs. MedSAM's 88.3%), and (iii) identification of four
critical tokens governing SAM's decisions. By unifying efficiency, reliability,
and interpretability, E-BayesSAM bridges SAM's versatility with clinical needs,
advancing deployment in safety-critical medical applications. The source code

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) is a fundamental task in intelligent
surveillance and public safety. Federated learning (FL) offers a
privacy-preserving solution by enabling collaborative model training without
centralized data collection. However, applying FL to real-world re-ID systems
faces two major challenges: statistical heterogeneity across clients due to
non-IID data distributions, and substantial communication overhead caused by
frequent transmission of large-scale models. To address these issues, we
propose FedKLPR, a lightweight and communication-efficient federated learning
framework for person re-identification. FedKLPR introduces four key components.
First, the KL-Divergence Regularization Loss (KLL) constrains local models by
minimizing the divergence from the global feature distribution, effectively
mitigating the effects of statistical heterogeneity and improving convergence
stability under non-IID conditions. Secondly, KL-Divergence-Prune Weighted
Aggregation (KLPWA) integrates pruning ratio and distributional similarity into
the aggregation process, thereby improving the robustness of the global model
while significantly reducing communication overhead. Furthermore, sparse
Activation Skipping (SAS) mitigates the dilution of critical parameters during
the aggregation of pruned client models by excluding zero-valued weights from
the update process. Finally, Cross-Round Recovery (CRR) introduces a dynamic
pruning control mechanism that halts pruning when necessary, enabling deeper
compression while maintaining model accuracy. Experimental results on eight
benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedKLPR achieves significant communication
reduction. Compared with the state-of-the-art, FedKLPR reduces 33\%-38\%
communication cost on ResNet-50 and 20\%-40\% communication cost on ResNet-34,
while maintaining model accuracy within 1\% degradation.

Abstract: We analyze data leakage in visual datasets. Data leakage refers to images in
evaluation benchmarks that have been seen during training, compromising fair
model evaluation. Given that large-scale datasets are often sourced from the

characterize visual leakage into different types according to its modality,
coverage, and degree. By applying image retrieval techniques, we unequivocally
show that all the analyzed datasets present some form of leakage, and that all
types of leakage, from severe instances to more subtle cases, compromise the
reliability of model evaluation in downstream tasks.

Abstract: This work addresses the challenges of data scarcity and high acquisition
costs for training robust object detection models in complex industrial
environments, such as offshore oil platforms. The practical and economic
barriers to collecting real-world data in these hazardous settings often hamper
the development of autonomous inspection systems. To overcome this, in this
work we propose and validate a hybrid data synthesis pipeline that combines
procedural rendering with AI-driven video generation. Our methodology leverages
BlenderProc to create photorealistic images with precise annotations and
controlled domain randomization, and integrates NVIDIA's Cosmos-Predict2
world-foundation model to synthesize physically plausible video sequences with
temporal diversity, capturing rare viewpoints and adverse conditions. We
demonstrate that a YOLO-based detection network trained on a composite dataset,
blending real images with our synthetic data, achieves superior performance
compared to models trained exclusively on real-world data. Notably, a 1:1
mixture of real and synthetic data yielded the highest accuracy, surpassing the
real-only baseline. These findings highlight the viability of a synthetic-first
approach as an efficient, cost-effective, and safe alternative for developing
reliable perception systems in safety-critical and resource-constrained
industrial applications.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on web-scale data exhibit promising
zero-shot generalization but often suffer from semantic misalignment due to
domain gaps between pre-training and downstream tasks. Existing approaches
primarily focus on text prompting with class-specific descriptions and
visual-text adaptation via aligning cropped image regions with textual
descriptions. However, they still face the issues of incomplete textual prompts
and noisy visual prompts. In this paper, we propose a novel constrained prompt
enhancement (CPE) method to improve visual-textual alignment by constructing
comprehensive textual prompts and compact visual prompts from the semantic
perspective. Specifically, our approach consists of two key components:
Topology-Guided Synonymous Semantic Generation (TGSSG) and Category-Agnostic
Discriminative Region Selection (CADRS). Textually, to address the issue of
incomplete semantic expression in textual prompts, our TGSSG first generates
synonymous semantic set for each category via large language models, and
constructs comprehensive textual prompts based on semantic ambiguity entropy
and persistent homology analysis. Visually, to mitigate the irrelevant visual
noise introduced by random cropping, our CADRS identifies discriminative
regions with activation maps outputted by a pre-trained vision model,
effectively filtering out noisy regions and generating compact visual prompts.
Given the comprehensive set of textual prompts and compact set of visual
prompts, we introduce two set-to-set matching strategies based on test-time
adaptation (TTA) and optimal transport (OT) to achieve effective visual-textual
alignment, and so improve zero-shot generalization of VLMs.

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限环境下训练ViT提供了一种可扩展、标签高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Training AI models to understand images without costly labeled data remains a
challenge. We combine two techniques--DINO (teacher-student learning) and
Barlow Twins (redundancy reduction)--to create a model that learns better with
fewer labels and less compute. While both DINO and Barlow Twins have
independently demonstrated strong performance in self-supervised learning, each
comes with limitations--DINO may be sensitive to certain augmentations, and
Barlow Twins often requires batch sizes too large to fit on consumer hardware.
By combining the redundancy-reduction objective of Barlow Twins with the
self-distillation strategy of DINO, we aim to leverage their complementary
strengths. We train a hybrid model on the MS COCO dataset using only 10\% of
labeled data for linear probing, and evaluate its performance against
standalone DINO and Barlow Twins implementations. Preliminary results show that
the combined approach achieves comparable loss and classification accuracy to
DINO while maintaining strong feature representations. Attention visualizations
further suggest improved semantic segmentation capability in the hybrid model.
This combined method offers a scalable, label-efficient alternative for
training ViTs in resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: 该方法在多项式时间复杂度和线性空间复杂度下实现了最先进的点云配准性能

Abstract: Point cloud registration based on correspondences computes the rigid
transformation that maximizes the number of inliers constrained within the
noise threshold. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods employing spatial
compatibility graphs or branch-and-bound (BnB) search mainly focus on
registration under high outlier ratios. However, graph-based methods require at
least quadratic space and time complexity for graph construction, while
multi-stage BnB search methods often suffer from inaccuracy due to local optima
between decomposed stages. This paper proposes a geometric maximum overlapping
registration framework via rotation-only BnB search. The rigid transformation
is decomposed using Chasles' theorem into a translation along rotation axis and
a 2D rigid transformation. The optimal rotation axis and angle are searched via
BnB, with residual parameters formulated as range maximum query (RMQ) problems.
Firstly, the top-k candidate rotation axes are searched within a hemisphere
parameterized by cube mapping, and the translation along each axis is estimated
through interval stabbing of the correspondences projected onto that axis.
Secondly, the 2D registration is relaxed to 1D rotation angle search with 2D
RMQ of geometric overlapping for axis-aligned rectangles, which is solved
deterministically in polynomial time using sweep line algorithm with segment
tree. Experimental results on 3DMatch, 3DLoMatch, and KITTI datasets
demonstrate superior accuracy and efficiency over SOTA methods, while the time
complexity is polynomial and the space complexity increases linearly with the
number of points, even in the worst case.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is indispensable in clinical practice but
remains constrained by fragmented, multi-stage workflows encompassing
acquisition, reconstruction, segmentation, detection, diagnosis, and reporting.
While deep learning has achieved progress in individual tasks, existing
approaches are often anatomy- or application-specific and lack generalizability
across diverse clinical settings. Moreover, current pipelines rarely integrate
imaging data with complementary language information that radiologists rely on
in routine practice. Here, we introduce OmniMRI, a unified vision-language
foundation model designed to generalize across the entire MRI workflow. OmniMRI
is trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous corpus curated from 60 public
datasets, over 220,000 MRI volumes and 19 million MRI slices, incorporating
image-only data, paired vision-text data, and instruction-response data. Its
multi-stage training paradigm, comprising self-supervised vision pretraining,
vision-language alignment, multimodal pretraining, and multi-task instruction
tuning, progressively equips the model with transferable visual
representations, cross-modal reasoning, and robust instruction-following
capabilities. Qualitative results demonstrate OmniMRI's ability to perform
diverse tasks within a single architecture, including MRI reconstruction,
anatomical and pathological segmentation, abnormality detection, diagnostic
suggestion, and radiology report generation. These findings highlight OmniMRI's
potential to consolidate fragmented pipelines into a scalable, generalist
framework, paving the way toward foundation models that unify imaging and
clinical language for comprehensive, end-to-end MRI interpretation.

Abstract: Metamaterials are micro-architected structures whose geometry imparts highly
tunable-often counter-intuitive-bulk properties. Yet their design is difficult
because of geometric complexity and a non-trivial mapping from architecture to
behaviour. We address these challenges with three complementary contributions.
(i) MetaDSL: a compact, semantically rich domain-specific language that
captures diverse metamaterial designs in a form that is both human-readable and
machine-parsable. (ii) MetaDB: a curated repository of more than 150,000
parameterized MetaDSL programs together with their
derivatives-three-dimensional geometry, multi-view renderings, and simulated
elastic properties. (iii) MetaBench: benchmark suites that test three core
capabilities of vision-language metamaterial assistants-structure
reconstruction, property-driven inverse design, and performance prediction. We
establish baselines by fine-tuning state-of-the-art vision-language models and
deploy an omni-model within an interactive, CAD-like interface. Case studies
show that our framework provides a strong first step toward integrated design
and understanding of structure-representation-property relationships.

Conclusion: TinySR证明了紧凑扩散模型在实时图像超分辨率中的可行性，在计算效率和模型大小方面取得显著改进。

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) focuses on recovering
high-quality images from low-resolution inputs that suffer from complex
degradations like noise, blur, and compression. Recently, diffusion models
(DMs) have shown great potential in this area by leveraging strong generative
priors to restore fine details. However, their iterative denoising process
incurs high computational overhead, posing challenges for real-time
applications. Although one-step distillation methods, such as OSEDiff and
TSD-SR, offer faster inference, they remain fundamentally constrained by their
large, over-parameterized model architectures. In this work, we present TinySR,
a compact yet effective diffusion model specifically designed for Real-ISR that
achieves real-time performance while maintaining perceptual quality. We
introduce a Dynamic Inter-block Activation and an Expansion-Corrosion Strategy
to facilitate more effective decision-making in depth pruning. We achieve VAE
compression through channel pruning, attention removal and lightweight SepConv.
We eliminate time- and prompt-related modules and perform pre-caching
techniques to further speed up the model. TinySR significantly reduces
computational cost and model size, achieving up to 5.68x speedup and 83%
parameter reduction compared to its teacher TSD-SR, while still providing high
quality results.

real-world applications often demand fine-grained, iterative image editing that
existing methods struggle to provide. Key challenges include granular
instruction understanding, robust context preservation during modifications,
and the lack of intelligent feedback mechanisms for iterative refinement. This
paper introduces RefineEdit-Agent, a novel, training-free intelligent agent
framework designed to address these limitations by enabling complex, iterative,
and context-aware image editing. RefineEdit-Agent leverages the powerful
planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the advanced visual
understanding and evaluation prowess of Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs)
within a closed-loop system. Our framework comprises an LVLM-driven instruction
parser and scene understanding module, a multi-level LLM-driven editing planner
for goal decomposition, tool selection, and sequence generation, an iterative
image editing module, and a crucial LVLM-driven feedback and evaluation loop.
To rigorously evaluate RefineEdit-Agent, we propose LongBench-T2I-Edit, a new
benchmark featuring 500 initial images with complex, multi-turn editing
instructions across nine visual dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that RefineEdit-Agent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving an average score of 3.67 on LongBench-T2I-Edit, compared to 2.29 for
Direct Re-Prompting, 2.91 for InstructPix2Pix, 3.16 for GLIGEN-based Edit, and
3.39 for ControlNet-XL. Ablation studies, human evaluations, and analyses of
iterative refinement, backbone choices, tool usage, and robustness to
instruction complexity further validate the efficacy of our agentic design in
delivering superior edit fidelity and context preservation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于显式网格表示和可微分光栅化的高效多视角表面重建方法，通过解耦几何与外观模型、神经变形场和正则化技术，在保持高效率的同时显著提升重建质量和应用范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经渲染多视角表面重建方法需要额外网格提取步骤、产生低质量表面和网格锯齿的问题，限制了下游应用。

Method: 使用显式网格表示和可微分光栅化框架，引入解耦的几何外观模型（不依赖深度网络），构建神经变形场整合全局几何上下文，采用新颖正则化约束几何特征，分离视角无关漫反射项并烘焙到网格顶点。

Result: 实现了最先进的训练速度（4.84分钟）和渲染速度（0.023秒），重建质量与顶级方法相当，支持网格和纹理编辑等实际应用。

Conclusion: 该方法在效率、质量和应用范围方面的优异表现，为多视角表面重建和渲染领域做出了重要贡献。

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of neural rendering-based multi-view
surface reconstruction methods, which require an additional mesh extraction
step that is inconvenient and would produce poor-quality surfaces with mesh
aliasing, restricting downstream applications. Building on the explicit mesh
representation and differentiable rasterization framework, this work proposes
an efficient solution that preserves the high efficiency of this framework
while significantly improving reconstruction quality and versatility.
Specifically, we introduce a disentangled geometry and appearance model that
does not rely on deep networks, enhancing learning and broadening
applicability. A neural deformation field is constructed to incorporate global
geometric context, enhancing geometry learning, while a novel regularization
constrains geometric features passed to a neural shader to ensure its accuracy
and boost shading. For appearance, a view-invariant diffuse term is separated
and baked into mesh vertices, further improving rendering efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art training (4.84 minutes) and rendering (0.023 seconds) speeds,
with reconstruction quality that is competitive with top-performing methods.
Moreover, the method enables practical applications such as mesh and texture
editing, showcasing its versatility and application potential. This combination
of efficiency, competitive quality, and broad applicability makes our approach
a valuable contribution to multi-view surface reconstruction and rendering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从视觉信息推断3D场景物理属性是创建交互式虚拟世界的关键挑战，现有方法依赖缓慢的逐场景优化，限制了通用性和应用

Method: 训练通用神经网络从3D视觉特征预测物理属性，使用监督损失，结合高斯泼溅等静态场景表示，利用CLIP等预训练视觉特征

Result: PIXIE比测试时优化方法快1.46-4.39倍且性能更好，速度快几个数量级，零样本泛化到真实场景

Conclusion: PIXIE提供了一种快速、通用的物理属性预测方法，通过大规模数据集PIXIEVERSE和预训练特征实现了优异的性能和泛化能力

Abstract: Inferring the physical properties of 3D scenes from visual information is a
critical yet challenging task for creating interactive and realistic virtual
worlds. While humans intuitively grasp material characteristics such as
elasticity or stiffness, existing methods often rely on slow, per-scene
optimization, limiting their generalizability and application. To address this
problem, we introduce PIXIE, a novel method that trains a generalizable neural
network to predict physical properties across multiple scenes from 3D visual
features purely using supervised losses. Once trained, our feed-forward network
can perform fast inference of plausible material fields, which coupled with a
learned static scene representation like Gaussian Splatting enables realistic
physics simulation under external forces. To facilitate this research, we also
collected PIXIEVERSE, one of the largest known datasets of paired 3D assets and
physic material annotations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that PIXIE is
about 1.46-4.39x better and orders of magnitude faster than test-time
optimization methods. By leveraging pretrained visual features like CLIP, our
method can also zero-shot generalize to real-world scenes despite only ever
been trained on synthetic data. https://pixie-3d.github.io/

Conclusion: 提出的基于Mamba和重建的开放集分割方法为户外场景点云数据处理提供了有效的解决方案，在性能和扩展性方面都有显著优势

Abstract: LiDAR scanning in outdoor scenes acquires accurate distance measurements over
wide areas, producing large-scale point clouds. Application examples for this
data include robotics, automotive vehicles, and land surveillance. During such
applications, outlier objects from outside the training data will inevitably
appear. Our research contributes a novel approach to open-set segmentation,
leveraging the learnings of object defect-detection research. We also draw on
the Mamba architecture's strong performance in utilising long-range
dependencies and scalability to large data. Combining both, we create a
reconstruction based approach for the task of outdoor scene open-set
segmentation. We show that our approach improves performance not only when
applied to our our own open-set segmentation method, but also when applied to
existing methods. Furthermore we contribute a Mamba based architecture which is
competitive with existing voxel-convolution based methods on challenging,
large-scale pointclouds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D物体检测研究主要在训练和测试集分布相同的有限数据集上进行，缺乏对跨数据集适应能力的考察。室内点云数据集因采集方式不同存在多种域差距问题。

Method: 构建包含ScanNet、SUN RGB-D、3D Front及新提出的ProcTHOR-OD和ProcFront数据集的综合基准，实验涵盖合成到真实、点云质量、布局和实例特征等多种适应场景。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来开发具有更强跨域泛化能力的3D物体检测器提供了重要基准和基础，推动了室内场景理解技术的发展。

Abstract: As a fundamental task for indoor scene understanding, 3D object detection has
been extensively studied, and the accuracy on indoor point cloud data has been
substantially improved. However, existing researches have been conducted on
limited datasets, where the training and testing sets share the same
distribution. In this paper, we consider the task of adapting indoor 3D object
detectors from one dataset to another, presenting a comprehensive benchmark
with ScanNet, SUN RGB-D and 3D Front datasets, as well as our newly proposed
large-scale datasets ProcTHOR-OD and ProcFront generated by a 3D simulator.
Since indoor point cloud datasets are collected and constructed in different
ways, the object detectors are likely to overfit to specific factors within
each dataset, such as point cloud quality, bounding box layout and instance
features. We conduct experiments across datasets on different adaptation
scenarios including synthetic-to-real adaptation, point cloud quality
adaptation, layout adaptation and instance feature adaptation, analyzing the
impact of different domain gaps on 3D object detectors. We also introduce
several approaches to improve adaptation performances, providing baselines for
domain adaptive indoor 3D object detection, hoping that future works may
propose detectors with stronger generalization ability across domains. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的少样本目标计数和检测方法主要关注物体类别，往往无法准确定位非物体模式，且将目标样本表示为空间压缩的原型会丢失结构信息。

Method: 采用经典的模板匹配和回归方法，在冻结的主干网络顶部添加少量可学习的卷积或投影层，有效保留和利用样本的空间布局信息。

Result: 在RPINE、FSCD-147和FSCD-LVIS三个基准测试中均优于最先进方法，并在跨数据集评估中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: TMR方法通过简单的模板匹配和回归结构，有效解决了少样本模式检测问题，特别是在处理非物体模式方面表现出色。

Abstract: We address the problem of few-shot pattern detection, which aims to detect
all instances of a given pattern, typically represented by a few exemplars,
from an input image. Although similar problems have been studied in few-shot
object counting and detection (FSCD), previous methods and their benchmarks
have narrowed patterns of interest to object categories and often fail to
localize non-object patterns. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
detector based on template matching and regression, dubbed TMR. While previous
FSCD methods typically represent target exemplars as spatially collapsed
prototypes and lose structural information, we revisit classic template
matching and regression. It effectively preserves and leverages the spatial
layout of exemplars through a minimalistic structure with a small number of
learnable convolutional or projection layers on top of a frozen backbone We
also introduce a new dataset, dubbed RPINE, which covers a wider range of
patterns than existing object-centric datasets. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods on the three benchmarks, RPINE, FSCD-147, and
FSCD-LVIS, and demonstrates strong generalization in cross-dataset evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在复杂未修剪视频中难以捕获细粒度动作、长期时间依赖和从低级视觉特征提取高级语义信息的问题。

Method: 采用双分支设计：视频编码分支用于时空特征提取，跨模态引导分支利用LVLM生成全局事件提示和时间子事件提示等多粒度语义描述，通过自适应门控、跨模态注意力和事件图模块进行融合。

Result: 在ActivityNet v1.3上平均mAP达到40.5%，在THUMOS14上mAP@0.5达到67.1%，超越了现有领先基线方法。

Conclusion: ECVT通过有效整合视觉语言模型的语义理解能力，显著提升了视频时序结构和事件逻辑的理解能力，为复杂视频动作识别和定位提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Action recognition and localization in complex, untrimmed videos remain a
formidable challenge in computer vision, largely due to the limitations of
existing methods in capturing fine-grained actions, long-term temporal
dependencies, and high-level semantic information from low-level visual
features. This paper introduces the Event-Contextualized Video Transformer
(ECVT), a novel architecture that leverages the advanced semantic understanding
capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to bridge this gap. ECVT
employs a dual-branch design, comprising a Video Encoding Branch for
spatio-temporal feature extraction and a Cross-Modal Guidance Branch. The
latter utilizes an LVLM to generate multi-granularity semantic descriptions,
including Global Event Prompting for macro-level narrative and Temporal
Sub-event Prompting for fine-grained action details. These multi-level textual
cues are integrated into the video encoder's learning process through
sophisticated mechanisms such as adaptive gating for high-level semantic
fusion, cross-modal attention for fine-grained feature refinement, and an event
graph module for temporal context calibration. Trained end-to-end with a
comprehensive loss function incorporating semantic consistency and temporal
calibration terms, ECVT significantly enhances the model's ability to
understand video temporal structures and event logic. Extensive experiments on
ActivityNet v1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets demonstrate that ECVT achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with an average mAP of 40.5% on ActivityNet v1.3
and mAP@0.5 of 67.1% on THUMOS14, outperforming leading baselines.

Conclusion: 基于视觉语言模型的层次化视觉信息整合方法能够有效应对具有挑战性的未知疾病检测问题，提升医疗诊断系统的可靠性

Abstract: In trustworthy medical diagnosis systems, integrating out-of-distribution
(OOD) detection aims to identify unknown diseases in samples, thereby
mitigating the risk of misdiagnosis. In this study, we propose a novel OOD
detection framework based on vision-language models (VLMs), which integrates
hierarchical visual information to cope with challenging unknown diseases that
resemble known diseases. Specifically, a cross-scale visual fusion strategy is
proposed to couple visual embeddings from multiple scales. This enriches the
detailed representation of medical images and thus improves the discrimination
of unknown diseases. Moreover, a cross-scale hard pseudo-OOD sample generation
strategy is proposed to benefit OOD detection maximally. Experimental
evaluations on three public medical datasets support that the proposed
framework achieves superior OOD detection performance compared to existing
methods. The source code is available at https://openi.pcl.ac.cn/OpenMedIA/HVL.

Conclusion: 该训练免调整框架能够高效地理解和对齐用户偏好，支持多轮交互精炼，为实时、上下文感知的图像生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has greatly enhanced creative expression, yet
achieving preference-aligned generation in a real-time and training-free manner
remains challenging. Previous methods often rely on static, pre-collected
preferences or fine-tuning, limiting adaptability to evolving and nuanced user
intents. In this paper, we highlight the need for instant preference-aligned
T2I generation and propose a training-free framework grounded in multimodal
large language model (MLLM) priors. Our framework decouples the task into two
components: preference understanding and preference-guided generation. For
preference understanding, we leverage MLLMs to automatically extract global
preference signals from a reference image and enrich a given prompt using
structured instruction design. Our approach supports broader and more
fine-grained coverage of user preferences than existing methods. For
preference-guided generation, we integrate global keyword-based control and
local region-aware cross-attention modulation to steer the diffusion model
without additional training, enabling precise alignment across both global
attributes and local elements. The entire framework supports multi-round
interactive refinement, facilitating real-time and context-aware image
generation. Extensive experiments on the Viper dataset and our collected
benchmark demonstrate that our method outperforms prior approaches in both
quantitative metrics and human evaluations, and opens up new possibilities for
dialog-based generation and MLLM-diffusion integration.

Conclusion: 该研究通过敏感性矩阵正则化方法，有效解决了多模态跟踪器调整中的可塑性-稳定性两难问题，为跨模态过度适应提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper tackles the critical challenge of optimizing multi-modal trackers
by effectively adapting the pre-trained models for RGB data. Existing
fine-tuning paradigms oscillate between excessive freedom and over-restriction,
both leading to a suboptimal plasticity-stability trade-off. To mitigate this
dilemma, we propose a novel sensitivity-aware regularized tuning framework,
which delicately refines the learning process by incorporating intrinsic
parameter sensitivities. Through a comprehensive investigation from pre-trained
to multi-modal contexts, we identify that parameters sensitive to pivotal
foundational patterns and cross-domain shifts are primary drivers of this
issue. Specifically, we first analyze the tangent space of pre-trained weights
to measure and orient prior sensitivities, dedicated to preserving
generalization. Then, we further explore transfer sensitivities during the
tuning phase, emphasizing adaptability and stability. By incorporating these
sensitivities as regularization terms, our method significantly enhances the
transferability across modalities. Extensive experiments showcase the superior
performance of the proposed method, surpassing current state-of-the-art
techniques across various multi-modal tracking. The source code and models will
be publicly available at https://github.com/zhiwen-xdu/SRTrack.

Abstract: During raw-data acquisition in CT imaging, diverse factors can degrade the
collected sinograms, with undersampling and noise leading to severe artifacts
and noise in reconstructed images and compromising diagnostic accuracy.
Conventional correction methods rely on manually designed algorithms or fixed
empirical parameters, but these approaches often lack generalizability across
heterogeneous artifact types. To address these limitations, we propose UniSino,
a foundation model for universal CT sinogram standardization. Unlike existing
foundational models that operate in image domain, UniSino directly standardizes
data in the projection domain, which enables stronger generalization across
diverse undersampling scenarios. Its training framework incorporates the
physical characteristics of sinograms, enhancing generalization and enabling
robust performance across multiple subtasks spanning four benchmark datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate thatUniSino achieves superior reconstruction
quality both single and mixed undersampling case, demonstrating exceptional
robustness and generalization in sinogram enhancement for CT imaging. The code

TL;DR: 提出VISA方法，通过图聚合和分组选择策略压缩视觉token，在保持性能的同时提升推理速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型中视觉token过多导致的推理效率低下问题

Method: 使用图聚合模块(VTA)基于语义相似度聚合视觉token信息，结合分组token选择策略(GTS)逐步压缩token

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，实现了模型性能和推理速度的更好平衡

Conclusion: VISA方法有效解决了视觉token冗余问题，为MLLMs提供了高效的视觉信息压缩方案

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel method called group-wise \textbf{VI}sual
token \textbf{S}election and \textbf{A}ggregation (VISA) to address the issue
of inefficient inference stemming from excessive visual tokens in multimoal
large language models (MLLMs). Compared with previous token pruning approaches,
our method can preserve more visual information while compressing visual
tokens. We first propose a graph-based visual token aggregation (VTA) module.
VTA treats each visual token as a node, forming a graph based on semantic
similarity among visual tokens. It then aggregates information from removed
tokens into kept tokens based on this graph, producing a more compact visual
token representation. Additionally, we introduce a group-wise token selection

Motivation: 多图像VQA中增加的图像数量引入了大量与问答无关的视觉冗余，影响准确性和效率，现有方法缺乏灵活性且产生离散的视觉片段

Method: 提出自适应视觉锚定策略，可无缝集成到现有MLLMs中实现自适应压缩；引入协作解码机制平衡全局和压缩视觉输入的结果

Result: 广泛实验验证了方法的有效性，在各种MLLMs上展示了一致的性能提升

Conclusion: 该方法能有效解决多图像VQA中的视觉冗余问题，提高模型性能，代码将公开

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven
significant progress in Visual Question Answering (VQA), evolving from Single
to Multi Image VQA (MVQA). However, the increased number of images in MVQA
inevitably introduces substantial visual redundancy that is irrelevant to
question answering, negatively impacting both accuracy and efficiency. To
address this issue, existing methods lack flexibility in controlling the number
of compressed visual tokens and tend to produce discrete visual fragments,
which hinder MLLMs' ability to comprehend images holistically. In this paper,
we propose a straightforward yet universal Adaptive Visual Anchoring strategy,
which can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLMs, offering significant
accuracy improvements through adaptive compression. Meanwhile, to balance the
results derived from both global and compressed visual input, we further
introduce a novel collaborative decoding mechanism, enabling optimal
performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method,
demonstrating consistent performance improvements across various MLLMs. The
code will be publicly available.

Conclusion: 该方法为自动内容验证和数字例证提供了轻量级、可解释性强的高效解决方案

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has led to a growing prevalence of
highly realistic AI-generated images, posing significant challenges for digital
forensics and content authentication. Conventional detection methods mainly
rely on deep learning models that extract global features, which often overlook
subtle structural inconsistencies and demand substantial computational
resources. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid detection
framework that combines a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) with a novel
edge-based image processing module. The edge-based module computes variance
from edge-difference maps generated before and after smoothing, exploiting the
observation that AI-generated images typically exhibit smoother textures,
weaker edges, and reduced noise compared to real images. When applied as a
post-processing step on ViT predictions, this module enhances sensitivity to
fine-grained structural cues while maintaining computational efficiency.
Extensive experiments on the CIFAKE, Artistic, and Custom Curated datasets
demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior detection performance
across all benchmarks, attaining 97.75% accuracy and a 97.77% F1-score on
CIFAKE, surpassing widely adopted state-of-the-art models. These results
establish the proposed method as a lightweight, interpretable, and effective
solution for both still images and video frames, making it highly suitable for
real-world applications in automated content verification and digital
forensics.

Conclusion: 提出的轻量级架构能够在降低硬件成本的同时保持强大的识别性能，有助于VSR系统在资源受限的实际场景中更广泛地应用

Abstract: Visual speech recognition (VSR) systems decode spoken words from an input
sequence using only the video data. Practical applications of such systems
include medical assistance as well as human-machine interactions. A VSR system
is typically employed in a complementary role in cases where the audio is
corrupt or not available. In order to accurately predict the spoken words,
these architectures often rely on deep neural networks in order to extract
meaningful representations from the input sequence. While deep architectures
achieve impressive recognition performance, relying on such models incurs
significant computation costs which translates into increased resource demands
in terms of hardware requirements and results in limited applicability in
real-world scenarios where resources might be constrained. This factor prevents
wider adoption and deployment of speech recognition systems in more practical
applications. In this work, we aim to alleviate this issue by developing
architectures for VSR that have low hardware costs. Following the standard
two-network design paradigm, where one network handles visual feature
extraction and another one utilizes the extracted features to classify the
entire sequence, we develop lightweight end-to-end architectures by first
benchmarking efficient models from the image classification literature, and
then adopting lightweight block designs in a temporal convolution network
backbone. We create several unified models with low resource requirements but
strong recognition performance. Experiments on the largest public database for
English words demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our developed
models. Code and trained models will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 研究确定了最优的CNN架构配置，但发现RadImageNet预训练并未在ACL撕裂和乳腺病变分类任务上表现出优于ImageNet预训练的性能。

Abstract: Modern computer vision models have proven to be highly useful for medical
imaging classification and segmentation tasks, but the scarcity of medical
imaging data often limits the efficacy of models trained from scratch. Transfer
learning has emerged as a pivotal solution to this, enabling the fine-tuning of
high-performance models on small data. Mei et al. (2022) found that
pre-training CNNs on a large dataset of radiologist-labeled images
(RadImageNet) enhanced model performance on downstream tasks compared to
ImageNet pretraining. The present work extends Mei et al. (2022) by conducting
a comprehensive investigation to determine optimal CNN architectures for breast
lesion malignancy detection and ACL tear detection, as well as performing
statistical analysis to compare the effect of RadImageNet and ImageNet
pre-training on downstream model performance. Our findings suggest that
1-dimensional convolutional classifiers with skip connections, ResNet50
pre-trained backbones, and partial backbone unfreezing yields optimal
downstream medical classification performance. Our best models achieve AUCs of
0.9969 for ACL tear detection and 0.9641 for breast nodule malignancy
detection, competitive with the results reported by Mei et al. (2022) and
surpassing other previous works. We do not find evidence confirming RadImageNet
pre-training to provide superior downstream performance for ACL tear and breast
lesion classification tasks.

Motivation: 当前长视频问答系统采用刚性流水线，将推理与感知解耦，导致信息丢失或计算效率低下。核心限制在于无法根据特定推理需求自适应地提取视觉信息。

Method: CAVIA引入三个创新：(1)分层推理引导精确定位到具体帧；(2)跨模态语义桥接进行目标提取；(3)置信度驱动的迭代合成，形成推理持续指导视觉提取的闭环系统。

Result: 在EgoSchema(65.7%, +5.3%)、NExT-QA(76.1%, +2.6%)和IntentQA(73.8%, +6.9%)等挑战性基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 动态的推理-感知协调为视频理解提供了可扩展的范式，证明了协调机制在视频理解中的重要性。

Abstract: Human video comprehension demonstrates dynamic coordination between reasoning
and visual attention, adaptively focusing on query-relevant details. However,
current long-form video question answering systems employ rigid pipelines that
decouple reasoning from perception, leading to either information loss through
premature visual abstraction or computational inefficiency through exhaustive
processing. The core limitation lies in the inability to adapt visual
extraction to specific reasoning requirements, different queries demand
fundamentally different visual evidence from the same video content. In this
work, we present CAVIA, a training-free framework that revolutionizes video
understanding through reasoning, perception coordination. Unlike conventional
approaches where visual processing operates independently of reasoning, CAVIA
creates a closed-loop system where reasoning continuously guides visual
extraction based on identified information gaps. CAVIA introduces three
innovations: (1) hierarchical reasoning, guided localization to precise frames;
(2) cross-modal semantic bridging for targeted extraction; (3)
confidence-driven iterative synthesis. CAVIA achieves state-of-the-art
performance on challenging benchmarks: EgoSchema (65.7%, +5.3%), NExT-QA
(76.1%, +2.6%), and IntentQA (73.8%, +6.9%), demonstrating that dynamic
reasoning-perception coordination provides a scalable paradigm for video
understanding.

Result: 实验结果表明IDU管道显著减少更新时间和劳动力，为快速演变的军事场景提供经济高效的有针对性解决方案

Conclusion: 该方法为军事3D虚拟环境的动态更新提供了有效的解决方案，能够在保持高质量的同时大幅降低更新成本

Abstract: For simulation and training purposes, military organizations have made
substantial investments in developing high-resolution 3D virtual environments
through extensive imaging and 3D scanning. However, the dynamic nature of
battlefield conditions-where objects may appear or vanish over time-makes
frequent full-scale updates both time-consuming and costly. In response, we
introduce the Incremental Dynamic Update (IDU) pipeline, which efficiently
updates existing 3D reconstructions, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), with
only a small set of newly acquired images. Our approach starts with camera pose
estimation to align new images with the existing 3D model, followed by change
detection to pinpoint modifications in the scene. A 3D generative AI model is
then used to create high-quality 3D assets of the new elements, which are
seamlessly integrated into the existing 3D model. The IDU pipeline incorporates
human guidance to ensure high accuracy in object identification and placement,
with each update focusing on a single new object at a time. Experimental
results confirm that our proposed IDU pipeline significantly reduces update
time and labor, offering a cost-effective and targeted solution for maintaining
up-to-date 3D models in rapidly evolving military scenarios.

Result: 实验显示HERO实现了1.73倍加速，质量退化极小，显著优于现有扩散加速方法

Conclusion: HERO框架有效解决了世界模型推理效率问题，通过利用特征耦合现象实现高质量加速

Abstract: Generation-driven world models create immersive virtual environments but
suffer slow inference due to the iterative nature of diffusion models. While
recent advances have improved diffusion model efficiency, directly applying
these techniques to world models introduces limitations such as quality
degradation. In this paper, we present HERO, a training-free hierarchical
acceleration framework tailored for efficient world models. Owing to the
multi-modal nature of world models, we identify a feature coupling phenomenon,
wherein shallow layers exhibit high temporal variability, while deeper layers
yield more stable feature representations. Motivated by this, HERO adopts
hierarchical strategies to accelerate inference: (i) In shallow layers, a
patch-wise refresh mechanism efficiently selects tokens for recomputation. With
patch-wise sampling and frequency-aware tracking, it avoids extra metric
computation and remain compatible with FlashAttention. (ii) In deeper layers, a
linear extrapolation scheme directly estimates intermediate features. This
completely bypasses the computations in attention modules and feed-forward
networks. Our experiments show that HERO achieves a 1.73$\times$ speedup with
minimal quality degradation, significantly outperforming existing diffusion
acceleration methods.

Abstract: Reasoning about fine-grained spatial relationships in warehouse-scale

(VLMs), which often struggle to comprehend 3D layouts, object arrangements, and
multimodal cues in real-world industrial settings. In this paper, we present
TinyGiantVLM, a lightweight and modular two-stage framework designed for
physical spatial reasoning, distinguishing itself from traditional geographic
reasoning in complex logistics scenes. Our approach encodes both global and
region-level features from RGB and depth modalities using pretrained visual
backbones. To effectively handle the complexity of high-modality inputs and
diverse question types, we incorporate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) fusion
module, which dynamically combines spatial representations to support
downstream reasoning tasks and improve convergence. Training is conducted in a
two-phase strategy: the first phase focuses on generating free-form answers to
enhance spatial reasoning ability, while the second phase uses normalized
answers for evaluation. Evaluated on Track 3 of the AI City Challenge 2025, our
64M-parameter base model achieved 5th place on the leaderboard with a score of

Conclusion: 持续学习为医学影像视觉异常检测提供了有效的自适应解决方案，PatchCoreCL展示了在该领域的巨大潜力和应用前景。

Abstract: Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) seeks to identify abnormal images and
precisely localize the corresponding anomalous regions, relying solely on
normal data during training. This approach has proven essential in domains such
as manufacturing and, more recently, in the medical field, where accurate and
explainable detection is critical. Despite its importance, the impact of
evolving input data distributions over time has received limited attention,
even though such changes can significantly degrade model performance. In
particular, given the dynamic and evolving nature of medical imaging data,
Continual Learning (CL) provides a natural and effective framework to
incrementally adapt models while preserving previously acquired knowledge. This
study explores for the first time the application of VAD models in a CL
scenario for the medical field. In this work, we utilize a CL version of the
well-established PatchCore model, called PatchCoreCL, and evaluate its
performance using BMAD, a real-world medical imaging dataset with both
image-level and pixel-level annotations. Our results demonstrate that
PatchCoreCL is an effective solution, achieving performance comparable to the
task-specific models, with a forgetting value less than a 1%, highlighting the
feasibility and potential of CL for adaptive VAD in medical imaging.

applied to Grevy's and plains zebras, giraffes, leopards, and lionfish. We
describe two approaches, both based on extracting and matching keypoints or
"hotspots". The first tests each new query image sequentially against each
database image, generating a score for each database image in isolation, and
ranking the results. The second, building on recent techniques for instance
recognition, matches the query image against the database using a fast nearest
neighbor search. It uses a competitive scoring mechanism derived from the Local
Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor algorithm recently proposed for category
recognition. We demonstrate results on databases of more than 1000 images,
producing more accurate matches than published methods and matching each query
image in just a few seconds.

TL;DR: DEHVF是一种基于动态嵌入和分层视觉特征融合的高效视觉-语言微调方法，通过轻量级分层视觉融合器动态选择和融合与LLM各层语义粒度对应的分层特征，避免序列扩展问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法将视觉特征投影后与文本标记拼接会导致输入序列长度显著增加，造成大量计算开销。现有融合方法虽然缓解了序列长度问题，但往往忽略了模型内的分层语义表示和浅层视觉编码层中的细粒度视觉信息。

Method: 通过轻量级分层视觉融合器，根据LLM各层的内部表示动态选择和融合对应语义粒度的分层特征，将融合后的层相关视觉特征投影对齐后直接嵌入到LLM相应层的FFN中。

Result: 在ScienceQA视觉问答和COCO Captions图像描述等多个VL基准测试中，DEHVF比现有的参数高效微调基线实现了更高的准确性，同时保持了高效的训练和推理。

Conclusion: DEHVF方法不仅避免了序列扩展，还动态融合了多层视觉信息，通过仅微调少量参数，实现了相同语义粒度下跨模态信息的精确对齐和互补。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) commonly follow a paradigm that projects
visual features and then concatenates them with text tokens to form a unified
sequence input for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, this paradigm leads
to a significant increase in the length of the input sequence, resulting in
substantial computational overhead. Existing methods attempt to fuse visual
information into the intermediate layers of LLMs, which alleviate the sequence
length issue but often neglect the hierarchical semantic representations within
the model and the fine-grained visual information available in the shallower
visual encoding layers. To address this limitation, we propose DEHVF, an
efficient vision-language fine-tuning method based on dynamic embedding and
fusion of hierarchical visual features. Its core lies in leveraging the
inherent hierarchical representation characteristics of visual encoders and
language models. Through a lightweight hierarchical visual fuser, it
dynamically selects and fuses hierarchical features corresponding to semantic
granularity based on the internal representations of each layer in LLMs. The
fused layer-related visual features are then projected and aligned before being
directly embedded into the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) of the corresponding
layer in LLMs. This approach not only avoids sequence expansion but also
dynamically fuses multi-layer visual information. By fine-tuning only a small
number of parameters, DEHVF achieves precise alignment and complementarity of
cross-modal information at the same semantic granularity. We conducted
experiments across various VL benchmarks, including visual question answering
on ScienceQA and image captioning on COCO Captions. The results demonstrate
that DEHVF achieves higher accuracy than existing parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) baselines while maintaining efficient training and
inference.

Abstract: Class Activation Maps (CAMs) are one of the important methods for visualizing
regions used by deep learning models. Yet their robustness to different noise
remains underexplored. In this work, we evaluate and report the resilience of
various CAM methods for different noise perturbations across multiple
architectures and datasets. By analyzing the influence of different noise types
on CAM explanations, we assess the susceptibility to noise and the extent to
which dataset characteristics may impact explanation stability. The findings
highlight considerable variability in noise sensitivity for various CAMs. We
propose a robustness metric for CAMs that captures two key properties:
consistency and responsiveness. Consistency reflects the ability of CAMs to
remain stable under input perturbations that do not alter the predicted class,
while responsiveness measures the sensitivity of CAMs to changes in the
prediction caused by such perturbations. The metric is evaluated empirically
across models, different perturbations, and datasets along with complementary
statistical tests to exemplify the applicability of our proposed approach.

Method: 使用加权Vision Transformer多任务学习框架，以基线MRI扫描为输入，联合预测24个月时的ADAS-Cog总分和13个子分数，系统研究子分数特异性损失加权对模型性能的影响

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种灵活、可解释的基于MRI的端到端AD预后方法，通过子分数特异性损失加权可以提升预测准确性和可解释性

Abstract: Prognostic modeling is essential for forecasting future clinical scores and
enabling early detection of Alzheimers disease (AD). While most existing
methods focus on predicting the ADAS-Cog global score, they often overlook the
predictive value of its 13 sub-scores, which reflect distinct cognitive
domains. Some sub-scores may exert greater influence on determining global
scores. Assigning higher loss weights to these clinically meaningful sub-scores
can guide the model to focus on more relevant cognitive domains, enhancing both
predictive accuracy and interpretability. In this study, we propose a weighted
Vision Transformer (ViT)-based multi-task learning (MTL) framework to jointly
predict the ADAS-Cog global score using baseline MRI scans and its 13
sub-scores at Month 24. Our framework integrates ViT as a feature extractor and
systematically investigates the impact of sub-score-specific loss weighting on
model performance. Results show that our proposed weighting strategies are
group-dependent: strong weighting improves performance for MCI subjects with
more heterogeneous MRI patterns, while moderate weighting is more effective for
CN subjects with lower variability. Our findings suggest that uniform weighting
underutilizes key sub-scores and limits generalization. The proposed framework
offers a flexible, interpretable approach to AD prognosis using end-to-end
MRI-based learning. (Github repo link will be provided after review)

TL;DR: JCo-MVTON是一个无需人体掩码的多模态扩散变换器虚拟试穿框架，通过多模态条件融合和双向生成策略，在公开基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统虚拟试穿系统过度依赖人体掩码、对服装属性控制有限、在真实场景中泛化能力差，需要新的解决方案来克服这些限制。

Method: 基于多模态扩散变换器(MM-DiT)架构，通过专用条件路径将参考人物图像和目标服装图像直接整合到去噪过程中，采用精炼的位置编码和注意力掩码，并使用双向生成策略构建数据集。

Result: 在DressCode等公开基准测试中显著优于现有方法，在定量指标和人工评估中都达到最先进性能，在真实世界应用中表现出强大的泛化能力，超越商业系统。

Conclusion: JCo-MVTON通过创新的多模态扩散变换器架构和数据集构建策略，成功解决了虚拟试穿系统中的关键挑战，为真实场景应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Virtual try-on systems have long been hindered by heavy reliance on human
body masks, limited fine-grained control over garment attributes, and poor
generalization to real-world, in-the-wild scenarios. In this paper, we propose
JCo-MVTON (Jointly Controllable Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer for Mask-Free
Virtual Try-On), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by
integrating diffusion-based image generation with multi-modal conditional
fusion. Built upon a Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) backbone, our
approach directly incorporates diverse control signals -- such as the reference
person image and the target garment image -- into the denoising process through
dedicated conditional pathways that fuse features within the self-attention
layers. This fusion is further enhanced with refined positional encodings and
attention masks, enabling precise spatial alignment and improved garment-person
integration. To address data scarcity and quality, we introduce a bidirectional
generation strategy for dataset construction: one pipeline uses a mask-based
model to generate realistic reference images, while a symmetric ``Try-Off''
model, trained in a self-supervised manner, recovers the corresponding garment
images. The synthesized dataset undergoes rigorous manual curation, allowing
iterative improvement in visual fidelity and diversity. Experiments demonstrate
that JCo-MVTON achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks
including DressCode, significantly outperforming existing methods in both
quantitative metrics and human evaluations. Moreover, it shows strong
generalization in real-world applications, surpassing commercial systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CEIDM是一种基于扩散模型的文本到图像生成方法，通过双重控制机制（实体控制和交互控制）来解决复杂实体及其交互关系的生成挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在文本到图像生成中，复杂实体及其精细交互关系的控制是一个重大挑战。现有基于扩散模型的方法难以有效控制实体和它们之间的交互，导致生成的图像质量不高且交互关系不合理。

Method: 1. 基于大语言模型的实体交互关系挖掘方法，通过思维链提取丰富合理的隐式交互关系；2. 交互动作聚类和偏移方法，通过全局和局部双向偏移增强语义理解；3. 实体控制网络，生成语义引导的掩码并利用多尺度卷积网络和动态网络融合特征。

Result: 实验表明，CEIDM方法在实体控制和交互控制方面均优于现有最具代表性的方法，能够生成更接近现实逻辑、交互关系更合理的高质量图像。

Conclusion: CEIDM通过双重控制机制有效解决了文本到图像生成中实体和交互关系的控制问题，显著提升了生成图像的质量和合理性，为复杂场景的图像生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In Text-to-Image (T2I) generation, the complexity of entities and their
intricate interactions pose a significant challenge for T2I method based on
diffusion model: how to effectively control entity and their interactions to
produce high-quality images. To address this, we propose CEIDM, a image
generation method based on diffusion model with dual controls for entity and
interaction. First, we propose an entity interactive relationships mining
approach based on Large Language Models (LLMs), extracting reasonable and rich
implicit interactive relationships through chain of thought to guide diffusion
models to generate high-quality images that are closer to realistic logic and
have more reasonable interactive relationships. Furthermore, We propose an
interactive action clustering and offset method to cluster and offset the
interactive action features contained in each text prompts. By constructing
global and local bidirectional offsets, we enhance semantic understanding and
detail supplementation of original actions, making the model's understanding of
the concept of interactive "actions" more accurate and generating images with
more accurate interactive actions. Finally, we design an entity control network
which generates masks with entity semantic guidance, then leveraging
multi-scale convolutional network to enhance entity feature and dynamic network
to fuse feature. It effectively controls entities and significantly improves
image quality. Experiments show that the proposed CEIDM method is better than
the most representative existing methods in both entity control and their
interaction control.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为BRAIN的偏置缓解持续学习方法，通过去偏对比学习和基于角度的遗忘缓解技术，解决了脑信号随时间衰减导致的表示偏移和性能下降问题，在多个基准测试中达到了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类大脑的记忆衰减导致脑信号随时间变得微弱、不确定且缺乏视觉上下文，这种不一致性会影响视觉-大脑理解模型的性能，造成累积偏置问题。

Method: 提出BRAIN偏置缓解持续学习方法，包括：1）持续学习框架逐步训练模型；2）去偏对比学习损失函数缓解偏置问题；3）基于角度的遗忘缓解方法防止灾难性遗忘。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在各种基准测试中都达到了最先进的性能，超越了先前的和非持续学习方法。

Conclusion: 该研究成功解决了脑信号不一致性带来的挑战，提出的BRAIN方法有效缓解了累积偏置和遗忘问题，为视觉-大脑理解领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Memory decay makes it harder for the human brain to recognize visual objects
and retain details. Consequently, recorded brain signals become weaker,
uncertain, and contain poor visual context over time. This paper presents one
of the first vision-learning approaches to address this problem. First, we
statistically and experimentally demonstrate the existence of inconsistency in
brain signals and its impact on the Vision-Brain Understanding (VBU) model. Our
findings show that brain signal representations shift over recording sessions,
leading to compounding bias, which poses challenges for model learning and
degrades performance. Then, we propose a new Bias-Mitigation Continual Learning
(BRAIN) approach to address these limitations. In this approach, the model is
trained in a continual learning setup and mitigates the growing bias from each
learning step. A new loss function named De-bias Contrastive Learning is also
introduced to address the bias problem. In addition, to prevent catastrophic
forgetting, where the model loses knowledge from previous sessions, the new
Angular-based Forgetting Mitigation approach is introduced to preserve learned
knowledge in the model. Finally, the empirical experiments demonstrate that our
approach achieves State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance across various
benchmarks, surpassing prior and non-continual learning methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出多任务学习框架，联合预测ADAS-Cog总分及其13个子项评分，发现子项学习能提升总分预测精度，但存在临床特征主导和模型不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注ADAS-Cog总分预测，忽视了子项评分在领域特异性认知衰退中的预测价值，且先前多任务学习研究未充分探索子项对总分的贡献机制。

Method: 采用Vision Transformer和Swin Transformer架构提取MRI影像特征，与纵向临床评分融合建模认知进展，构建多任务学习框架同时预测24个月时的总分和13个子项评分。

Result: 子项学习提高了总分预测精度，Q1(单词回忆)、Q4(延迟回忆)、Q8(单词识别)等少数子项主导总分预测，但部分重要子项预测误差较高，存在模型不稳定问题。

Conclusion: 研究证明了子项信息建模的价值，揭示了临床特征主导导致的不平衡学习问题，强调需要改进多模态融合和自适应损失加权来构建更可解释和临床稳健的AD预测框架。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of clinical scores is critical for early detection and
prognosis of Alzheimers disease (AD). While existing approaches primarily focus
on forecasting the ADAS-Cog global score, they often overlook the predictive
value of its sub-scores (13 items), which capture domain-specific cognitive
decline. In this study, we propose a multi task learning (MTL) framework that
jointly predicts the global ADAS-Cog score and its sub-scores (13 items) at
Month 24 using baseline MRI and longitudinal clinical scores from baseline and
Month 6. The main goal is to examine how each sub scores particularly those
associated with MRI features contribute to the prediction of the global score,
an aspect largely neglected in prior MTL studies. We employ Vision Transformer
(ViT) and Swin Transformer architectures to extract imaging features, which are
fused with longitudinal clinical inputs to model cognitive progression. Our
results show that incorporating sub-score learning improves global score
prediction. Subscore level analysis reveals that a small subset especially Q1
(Word Recall), Q4 (Delayed Recall), and Q8 (Word Recognition) consistently
dominates the predicted global score. However, some of these influential
sub-scores exhibit high prediction errors, pointing to model instability.
Further analysis suggests that this is caused by clinical feature dominance,
where the model prioritizes easily predictable clinical scores over more
complex MRI derived features. These findings emphasize the need for improved
multimodal fusion and adaptive loss weighting to achieve more balanced
learning. Our study demonstrates the value of sub score informed modeling and
provides insights into building more interpretable and clinically robust AD
prediction frameworks. (Github repo provided)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在计算机视觉领域表现出色，但现有模型如CNN和ViT被视为"黑盒"，决策过程缺乏透明度。尽管可解释AI有所进展，但在实际CV部署中仍未充分利用，主要障碍是缺乏将XAI技术与强大知识管理和监控框架集成的软件解决方案。

Method: 开发了Obz AI软件生态系统，提供从Python客户端库到全栈分析仪表板的无缝集成管道。机器学习工程师可以轻松整合先进XAI方法，提取和分析特征进行异常检测，并实时持续监控AI模型。

Result: Obz AI使深度模型的决策机制变得可解释，促进了计算机视觉系统的可观测性和负责任部署。

Conclusion: Obz AI填补了XAI技术与实际CV部署之间的集成空白，为视觉AI系统提供了全面的解释性和监控解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning has transformed computer vision (CV), achieving outstanding
performance in classification, segmentation, and related tasks. Such AI-based
CV systems are becoming prevalent, with applications spanning from medical
imaging to surveillance. State of the art models such as convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) are often regarded as ``black
boxes,'' offering limited transparency into their decision-making processes.
Despite a recent advancement in explainable AI (XAI), explainability remains
underutilized in practical CV deployments. A primary obstacle is the absence of
integrated software solutions that connect XAI techniques with robust knowledge
management and monitoring frameworks. To close this gap, we have developed Obz
AI, a comprehensive software ecosystem designed to facilitate state-of-the-art
explainability and observability for vision AI systems. Obz AI provides a
seamless integration pipeline, from a Python client library to a full-stack
analytics dashboard. With Obz AI, a machine learning engineer can easily
incorporate advanced XAI methodologies, extract and analyze features for
outlier detection, and continuously monitor AI models in real time. By making
the decision-making mechanisms of deep models interpretable, Obz AI promotes
observability and responsible deployment of computer vision systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 慢性伤口管理是重大医疗挑战，现有临床评估依赖主观且耗时的人工记录方法。2D数字视频测量框架存在视角失真、视野有限、无法捕捉伤口深度等问题，特别是在解剖结构复杂或弯曲区域。

Method: 提出Wound3DAssist框架，从手持智能手机短视频生成精确3D模型，集成3D重建、伤口分割、组织分类和伤口周围分析到模块化工作流程中，实现非接触式自动测量。

Conclusion: Wound3DAssist证明了在真实临床环境中使用的可行性，为慢性伤口管理提供了更客观、准确的3D评估解决方案。

Abstract: Managing chronic wounds remains a major healthcare challenge, with clinical
assessment often relying on subjective and time-consuming manual documentation
methods. Although 2D digital videometry frameworks aided the measurement
process, these approaches struggle with perspective distortion, a limited field
of view, and an inability to capture wound depth, especially in anatomically
complex or curved regions. To overcome these limitations, we present
Wound3DAssist, a practical framework for 3D wound assessment using monocular
consumer-grade videos. Our framework generates accurate 3D models from short
handheld smartphone video recordings, enabling non-contact, automatic
measurements that are view-independent and robust to camera motion. We
integrate 3D reconstruction, wound segmentation, tissue classification, and
periwound analysis into a modular workflow. We evaluate Wound3DAssist across
digital models with known geometry, silicone phantoms, and real patients.
Results show that the framework supports high-quality wound bed visualization,
millimeter-level accuracy, and reliable tissue composition analysis. Full
assessments are completed in under 20 minutes, demonstrating feasibility for
real-world clinical use.

TL;DR: 提出新的混合损失函数HyTver，用于解决多发性硬化症病灶分割中的数据不平衡问题，在保持Dice分数0.659的同时确保距离指标性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纵向多发性硬化症病灶分割面临输入输出数据不平衡的挑战，现有损失函数如Dice损失和交叉熵损失缺乏针对性考虑，且其他解决方案存在计算复杂或指标性能不均衡的问题。

Method: 开发名为HyTver的新型混合损失函数，旨在解决数据不平衡问题，同时避免过度计算复杂性和保持多指标性能平衡。

Result: HyTver实现了0.659的Dice分数，距离指标性能与其他流行损失函数相当，并在预训练模型上表现出良好的稳定性。

Conclusion: HyTver损失函数在解决多发性硬化症病灶分割不平衡问题方面表现出色，既保持了分割性能又在多个指标上取得平衡，为医学图像分割提供了有效的损失函数选择。

Abstract: Longitudinal Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Segmentation is a particularly
challenging problem that involves both input and output imbalance in the data
and segmentation. Therefore in order to develop models that are practical, one
of the solutions is to develop better loss functions. Most models naively use
either Dice loss or Cross-Entropy loss or their combination without too much
consideration. However, one must select an appropriate loss function as the
imbalance can be mitigated by selecting a proper loss function. In order to
solve the imbalance problem, multiple loss functions were proposed that claimed
to solve it. They come with problems of their own which include being too
computationally complex due to hyperparameters as exponents or having
detrimental performance in metrics other than region-based ones. We propose a
novel hybrid loss called HyTver that achieves good segmentation performance
while maintaining performance in other metrics. We achieve a Dice score of
0.659 while also ensuring that the distance-based metrics are comparable to
other popular functions. In addition, we also evaluate the stability of the
loss functions when used on a pre- trained model and perform extensive
comparisons with other popular loss functions

Conclusion: 该工作不仅提供了宝贵的新资源，还提出了一个强大且高度可泛化的框架，推动了农业AI应用向实际大规模应用的发展

Abstract: Early diagnosis of plant diseases is critical for global food safety, yet
most AI solutions lack the generalization required for real-world agricultural
diversity. These models are typically constrained to specific species, failing
to perform accurately across the broad spectrum of cultivated plants. To
address this gap, we first introduce the FloraSyntropy Archive, a large-scale
dataset of 178,922 images across 35 plant species, annotated with 97 distinct
disease classes. We establish a benchmark by evaluating numerous existing
models on this archive, revealing a significant performance gap. We then
propose FloraSyntropy-Net, a novel federated learning framework (FL) that
integrates a Memetic Algorithm (MAO) for optimal base model selection
(DenseNet201), a novel Deep Block for enhanced feature representation, and a
client-cloning strategy for scalable, privacy-preserving training.
FloraSyntropy-Net achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 96.38% on the
FloraSyntropy benchmark. Crucially, to validate its generalization capability,
we test the model on the unrelated multiclass Pest dataset, where it
demonstrates exceptional adaptability, achieving 99.84% accuracy. This work
provides not only a valuable new resource but also a robust and highly
generalizable framework that advances the field towards practical, large-scale
agricultural AI applications.

Abstract: Complex tubular structures are essential in medical imaging and
computer-assisted diagnosis, where their integrity enhances anatomical
visualization and lesion detection. However, existing segmentation algorithms
struggle with structural discontinuities, particularly in severe clinical cases
such as coronary artery stenosis and vessel occlusions, which leads to
undesired discontinuity and compromising downstream diagnostic accuracy.
Therefore, it is imperative to reconnect discontinuous structures to ensure
their completeness. In this study, we explore the tubular structure completion
based on point cloud for the first time and establish a Point Cloud-based
Coronary Artery Completion (PC-CAC) dataset, which is derived from real
clinical data. This dataset provides a novel benchmark for tubular structure
completion. Additionally, we propose TSRNet, a Tubular Structure Reconnection
Network that integrates a detail-preservated feature extractor, a multiple
dense refinement strategy, and a global-to-local loss function to ensure
accurate reconnection while maintaining structural integrity. Comprehensive
experiments on our PC-CAC and two additional public datasets (PC-ImageCAS and
PC-PTR) demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches across multiple evaluation metrics, setting a new benchmark for
point cloud-based tubular structure reconstruction. Our benchmark is available

Conclusion: 该研究为数字病理学领域的自动化检测策略和临床工作流提供了可操作的见解，推进了对模型优势和局限性的理解。

Abstract: Accurate detection of diseased glomeruli is fundamental to progress in renal
pathology and underpins the delivery of reliable clinical diagnoses. Although
recent advances in computer vision have produced increasingly sophisticated
detection algorithms, the majority of research efforts have focused on normal
glomeruli or instances of global sclerosis, leaving the wider spectrum of
diseased glomerular subtypes comparatively understudied. This disparity is not
without consequence; the nuanced and highly variable morphological
characteristics that define these disease variants frequently elude even the
most advanced computational models. Moreover, ongoing debate surrounds the
choice of optimal imaging magnifications and region-of-view dimensions for
fine-grained glomerular analysis, adding further complexity to the pursuit of
accurate classification and robust segmentation.
  To bridge these gaps, we present M^3-GloDet, a systematic framework designed
to enable thorough evaluation of detection models across a broad continuum of
regions, scales, and classes. Within this framework, we evaluate both
long-standing benchmark architectures and recently introduced state-of-the-art
models that have achieved notable performance, using an experimental design
that reflects the diversity of region-of-interest sizes and imaging resolutions
encountered in routine digital renal pathology. As the results, we found that
intermediate patch sizes offered the best balance between context and
efficiency. Additionally, moderate magnifications enhanced generalization by
reducing overfitting. Through systematic comparison of these approaches on a
multi-class diseased glomerular dataset, our aim is to advance the
understanding of model strengths and limitations, and to offer actionable
insights for the refinement of automated detection strategies and clinical
workflows in the digital pathology domain.

Conclusion: LGTTP是模型无关的高效视频处理框架，在处理显式时间标记查询方面表现优异，适用于通用视频理解任务

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) struggle with long-form videos due to the
quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms. We propose Language-Guided
Temporal Token Pruning (LGTTP), which leverages temporal cues from queries to
adaptively prune video tokens, preserving contextual continuity while reducing
computational overhead. Unlike uniform pruning or keyframe selection, LGTTP
retains higher token density in temporally relevant segments. Our
model-agnostic framework integrates with TimeChat and LLaVA-Video, achieving a
65% reduction in computation while preserving 97-99% of the original
performance. On QVHighlights, LGTTP improves HIT@1 by +9.5%, and on
Charades-STA, it retains 99.6% of R@1. It excels on queries with explicit
temporal markers and remains effective across general video understanding
tasks.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become an essential component
of medical imaging research, aiming to increase transparency and clinical trust
in deep learning models. This study investigates brain hemorrhage diagnosis
with a focus on explainability through Class Activation Mapping (CAM)
techniques. A pipeline was developed to extract pixellevel segmentation and
detection annotations from classification models using nine state-of-the-art
CAM algorithms, applied across multiple network stages, and quantitatively
evaluated on the Hemorica dataset, which uniquely provides both slice-level
labels and high-quality segmentation masks. Metrics including Dice, IoU, and
pixel-wise overlap were employed to benchmark CAM variants. Results show that
the strongest localization performance occurred at stage 5 of EfficientNetV2S,
with HiResCAM yielding the highest bounding-box alignment and AblationCAM
achieving the best pixel-level Dice (0.57) and IoU (0.40), representing strong
accuracy given that models were trained solely for classification without
segmentation supervision. To the best of current knowledge, this is among the f
irst works to quantitatively compare CAM methods for brain hemorrhage
detection, establishing a reproducible benchmark and underscoring the potential
of XAI-driven pipelines for clinically meaningful AI-assisted diagnosis.

quality. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CATformer
outperforms recent transformer-based and diffusion-inspired methods both in
efficiency and visual image quality. This work bridges the performance gap
among transformer-, diffusion-, and GAN-based methods, laying a foundation for
practical applications of diffusion-inspired transformers in super-resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的隐式表示方法提供平滑几何但无法建模高频细节，模板重建方法使用顶点位移导致伪影，需要解决这些限制来实现高质量的动态服装重建

Method: 提出神经梯度变形方法(NGD)，结合自适应重网格策略建模动态表面(如褶皱)，并学习动态纹理图来捕捉每帧光照和阴影效果

Result: 通过广泛的定性和定量评估，证明相比现有最先进方法有显著改进，能够提供高质量的服装重建结果

Conclusion: NGD方法能够有效解决动态服装重建中的复杂动力学和无约束性质问题，实现高质量的几何重建和纹理细节捕捉

Abstract: Dynamic garment reconstruction from monocular video is an important yet
challenging task due to the complex dynamics and unconstrained nature of the
garments. Recent advancements in neural rendering have enabled high-quality
geometric reconstruction with image/video supervision. However, implicit
representation methods that use volume rendering often provide smooth geometry
and fail to model high-frequency details. While template reconstruction methods
model explicit geometry, they use vertex displacement for deformation, which
results in artifacts. Addressing these limitations, we propose NGD, a Neural
Gradient-based Deformation method to reconstruct dynamically evolving textured
garments from monocular videos. Additionally, we propose a novel adaptive
remeshing strategy for modelling dynamically evolving surfaces like wrinkles
and pleats of the skirt, leading to high-quality reconstruction. Finally, we
learn dynamic texture maps to capture per-frame lighting and shadow effects. We
provide extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations to demonstrate
significant improvements over existing SOTA methods and provide high-quality
garment reconstructions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对话检索无法满足用户在长对话中查找语义连贯的分散内容的需求，需要新的方法来检索跨模态的对话片段。

Method: 构建MLDR数据集，提出F2RVLM模型：1）监督微调注入片段级检索知识；2）GRPO强化学习多目标奖励；3）难度感知课程采样。

Result: F2RVLM在领域内和真实场景下均优于现有VLM模型，展现了优异的检索性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了长对话中跨模态片段检索的挑战，为实际应用提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Traditional dialogue retrieval aims to select the most appropriate utterance
or image from recent dialogue history. However, they often fail to meet users'
actual needs for revisiting semantically coherent content scattered across
long-form conversations. To fill this gap, we define the Fine-grained Fragment
Retrieval (FFR) task, requiring models to locate query-relevant fragments,
comprising both utterances and images, from multimodal long-form dialogues. As
a foundation for FFR, we construct MLDR, the longest-turn multimodal dialogue
retrieval dataset to date, averaging 25.45 turns per dialogue, with each
naturally spanning three distinct topics. To evaluate generalization in
real-world scenarios, we curate and annotate a WeChat-based test set comprising
real-world multimodal dialogues with an average of 75.38 turns. Building on
these resources, we explore existing generation-based Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) on FFR and observe that they often retrieve incoherent utterance-image
fragments. While optimized for generating responses from visual-textual inputs,
these models lack explicit supervision to ensure semantic coherence within
retrieved fragments. To this end, we propose F2RVLM, a generative retrieval
model trained in a two-stage paradigm: (1) supervised fine-tuning to inject
fragment-level retrieval knowledge, and (2) GRPO-based reinforcement learning
with multi-objective rewards promoting semantic precision, relevance, and
contextual coherence. To handle varying intra-fragment complexity, from locally
dense to sparsely distributed, we introduce difficulty-aware curriculum
sampling that ranks training instances by model-predicted difficulty and
gradually exposes the model to harder samples. This boosts reasoning ability in
long, multi-turn contexts. F2RVLM outperforms popular VLMs in both in-domain
and real-domain settings, demonstrating superior retrieval performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要为每个动作类别单独训练模型且需要大量正常样本，限制了在数据稀缺或新类别频繁出现的真实场景中的可扩展性和应用性

Method: 构建类别无关的对比学习表示空间，引入基于扩散模型的生成式动作增强策略来创建多样化的训练样本，通过支持集比较进行异常检测

Result: 在HumanAct12数据集上，无论是已见类别还是未见类别设置下，在训练效率和模型可扩展性方面都达到了最先进的少样本HAAD效果

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了少样本人类动作异常检测的挑战，通过统一的类别无关方法和生成增强策略，显著提升了模型的泛化能力和实用性

Abstract: Human Action Anomaly Detection (HAAD) aims to identify anomalous actions
given only normal action data during training. Existing methods typically
follow a one-model-per-category paradigm, requiring separate training for each
action category and a large number of normal samples. These constraints hinder
scalability and limit applicability in real-world scenarios, where data is
often scarce or novel categories frequently appear. To address these
limitations, we propose a unified framework for HAAD that is compatible with
few-shot scenarios. Our method constructs a category-agnostic representation
space via contrastive learning, enabling AD by comparing test samples with a
given small set of normal examples (referred to as the support set). To improve
inter-category generalization and intra-category robustness, we introduce a
generative motion augmentation strategy harnessing a diffusion-based foundation
model for creating diverse and realistic training samples. Notably, to the best
of our knowledge, our work is the first to introduce such a strategy
specifically tailored to enhance contrastive learning for action AD. Extensive
experiments on the HumanAct12 dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art
effectiveness of our approach under both seen and unseen category settings,
regarding training efficiency and model scalability for few-shot HAAD.

Motivation: 宫颈癌是女性主要死因，传统Pap涂片检测耗时且易出错，需要自动化辅助诊断工具

Method: 使用U-Net进行图像分割，然后训练分类模型，在Herlev数据集上比较分割前后图像对分类性能的影响

Result: 分割图像使精确度提高约0.41%，F1分数提高约1.30%，但整体提升有限

Conclusion: 分割有助于特征提取但对分类性能影响有限，该框架可作为临床辅助诊断工具

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a significant global health concern and a leading
cause of cancer-related deaths among women. Early detection through Pap smear
tests is essential to reduce mortality rates; however, the manual examination
is time consuming and prone to human error. This study proposes a deep learning
framework that integrates U-Net for segmentation and a classification model to
enhance diagnostic performance. The Herlev Pap Smear Dataset, a publicly
available cervical cell dataset, was utilized for training and evaluation. The
impact of segmentation on classification performance was evaluated by comparing
the model trained on segmented images and another trained on non-segmented
images. Experimental results showed that the use of segmented images marginally
improved the model performance on precision (about 0.41 percent higher) and
F1-score (about 1.30 percent higher), which suggests a slightly more balanced
classification performance. While segmentation helps in feature extraction, the
results showed that its impact on classification performance appears to be
limited. The proposed framework offers a supplemental tool for clinical
applications, which may aid pathologists in early diagnosis.

Conclusion: CMFDNet通过创新的模块设计有效解决了结肠息肉分割的关键挑战，在多个基准数据集上取得了最先进的性能表现。

Abstract: Automated colonic polyp segmentation is crucial for assisting doctors in
screening of precancerous polyps and diagnosis of colorectal neoplasms.
Although existing methods have achieved promising results, polyp segmentation
remains hindered by the following limitations,including: (1) significant
variation in polyp shapes and sizes, (2) indistinct boundaries between polyps
and adjacent tissues, and (3) small-sized polyps are easily overlooked during
the segmentation process. Driven by these practical difficulties, an innovative
architecture, CMFDNet, is proposed with the CMD module, MSA module, and FD
module. The CMD module, serving as an innovative decoder, introduces a
cross-scanning method to reduce blurry boundaries. The MSA module adopts a
multi-branch parallel structure to enhance the recognition ability for polyps
with diverse geometries and scale distributions. The FD module establishes
dependencies among all decoder features to alleviate the under-detection of
polyps with small-scale features. Experimental results show that CMFDNet
outperforms six SOTA methods used for comparison, especially on ETIS and
ColonDB datasets, where mDice scores exceed the best SOTA method by 1.83% and
1.55%, respectively.

Abstract: Estimating the 3D pose of a drone is important for anti-drone systems, but
existing methods struggle with the unique challenges of drone keypoint
detection. Drone propellers serve as keypoints but are difficult to detect due
to their high visual similarity and diversity of poses. To address these
challenges, we propose DroneKey, a framework that combines a 2D keypoint
detector and a 3D pose estimator specifically designed for drones. In the
keypoint detection stage, we extract two key-representations (intermediate and
compact) from each transformer encoder layer and optimally combine them using a
gated sum. We also introduce a pose-adaptive Mahalanobis distance in the loss
function to ensure stable keypoint predictions across extreme poses. We built
new datasets of drone 2D keypoints and 3D pose to train and evaluate our
method, which have been publicly released. Experiments show that our method
achieves an AP of 99.68% (OKS) in keypoint detection, outperforming existing
methods. Ablation studies confirm that the pose-adaptive Mahalanobis loss
function improves keypoint prediction stability and accuracy. Additionally,
improvements in the encoder design enable real-time processing at 44 FPS. For
3D pose estimation, our method achieved an MAE-angle of 10.62{\deg}, an RMSE of
0.221m, and an MAE-absolute of 0.076m, demonstrating high accuracy and
reliability. The code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: 本文通过实证分析研究了CLIP预训练模型中的社会偏见如何传播到下游任务，发现偏见测量高度依赖于数据子集，预训练偏见与下游任务偏见之间缺乏一致的相关性，且不同CLIP模型在下游任务适应时表征空间趋于收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着CLIP预训练模型被广泛用于下游任务，需要深入分析其迁移性影响，特别是这些模型记录在案的社会偏见和人类刻板印象如何传播到视觉问答、图像字幕等下游应用中。

Method: 通过全面的实证分析：1) 检查预训练偏见在数据全局和局部视图中的变化；2) 分析不同预训练偏见水平下预训练模型与下游任务偏见之间的相关性；3) 探索偏见转移不一致性的原因。

Result: 研究发现偏见测量高度依赖于计算所用的数据子集；预训练偏见与下游任务偏见之间难以发现一致的趋势；在当前范式下，不同预训练CLIP模型适应下游任务时表征空间趋于收敛。

Conclusion: 这项工作为偏见行为提供了有价值的见解，并为未来研究促进更好的偏见缓解实践提供了信息，强调了当前偏见转移分析方法的局限性。

Abstract: The recycling of contrastive language-image pre-trained (CLIP) models as
backbones for a large number of downstream tasks calls for a thorough analysis
of their transferability implications, especially their well-documented
reproduction of social biases and human stereotypes. How do such biases,
learned during pre-training, propagate to downstream applications like visual
question answering or image captioning? Do they transfer at all?
  We investigate this phenomenon, referred to as bias transfer in prior
literature, through a comprehensive empirical analysis. Firstly, we examine how
pre-training bias varies between global and local views of data, finding that
bias measurement is highly dependent on the subset of data on which it is
computed. Secondly, we analyze correlations between biases in the pre-trained
models and the downstream tasks across varying levels of pre-training bias,
finding difficulty in discovering consistent trends in bias transfer. Finally,
we explore why this inconsistency occurs, showing that under the current
paradigm, representation spaces of different pre-trained CLIPs tend to converge
when adapted for downstream tasks. We hope this work offers valuable insights
into bias behavior and informs future research to promote better bias
mitigation practices.

Conclusion: RAD框架对噪声训练条件具有卓越的鲁棒性，能够检测各种工业场景中的细微异常，是实际应用中数据质量不完美时的实用解决方案

Abstract: Anomaly detection is fundamental for ensuring quality control and operational
efficiency in industrial environments, yet conventional approaches face
significant challenges when training data contains mislabeled samples-a common
occurrence in real-world scenarios. This paper presents RAD, a robust anomaly
detection framework that integrates Normalizing Flows with Model-Agnostic
Meta-Learning to address the critical challenge of label noise in industrial
settings. Our approach employs a bi-level optimization strategy where
meta-learning enables rapid adaptation to varying noise conditions, while
uncertainty quantification guides adaptive L2 regularization to maintain model
stability. The framework incorporates multiscale feature processing through
pretrained feature extractors and leverages the precise likelihood estimation
capabilities of Normalizing Flows for robust anomaly scoring. Comprehensive
evaluation on MVTec-AD and KSDD2 datasets demonstrates superior performance,
achieving I-AUROC scores of 95.4% and 94.6% respectively under clean
conditions, while maintaining robust detection capabilities above 86.8% and
92.1% even when 50% of training samples are mislabeled. The results highlight
RAD's exceptional resilience to noisy training conditions and its ability to
detect subtle anomalies across diverse industrial scenarios, making it a
practical solution for real-world anomaly detection applications where perfect
data curation is challenging.

Abstract: The most popular networks used for cell segmentation (e.g. Cellpose,
Stardist, HoverNet,...) rely on a prediction of a distance map. It yields
unprecedented accuracy but hinges on fully annotated datasets. This is a
serious limitation to generate training sets and perform transfer learning. In
this paper, we propose a method that still relies on the distance map and
handles partially annotated objects. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed approach in the contexts of frugal learning, transfer learning and
regular learning on regular databases. Our experiments show that it can lead to
substantial savings in time and resources without sacrificing segmentation
quality. The proposed algorithm is embedded in a user-friendly Napari plugin.

Method: 提出位置重加权视觉token剪枝方法，根据视觉token在图像中的空间位置对其注意力分数进行重新加权，这是一个即插即用的解决方案，无需改变模型架构或额外训练。

Result: 在大型视觉语言模型上的大量实验表明，该方法以最小的计算开销显著提升了视觉token剪枝的性能。

Conclusion: 通过简单的空间位置重加权机制可以有效缓解视觉token剪枝中的近因偏差问题，为视觉语言模型的高效计算提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) typically process a significantly larger number
of visual tokens compared to text tokens due to the inherent redundancy in
visual signals. Visual token pruning is a promising direction to reduce the
computational cost of VLMs by eliminating redundant visual tokens. The
text-visual attention score is a widely adopted criterion for visual token
pruning as it reflects the relevance of visual tokens to the text input.
However, many sequence models exhibit a recency bias, where tokens appearing
later in the sequence exert a disproportionately large influence on the model's
output. In VLMs, this bias manifests as inflated attention scores for tokens
corresponding to the lower regions of the image, leading to suboptimal pruning
that disproportionately retains tokens from the image bottom. In this paper, we
present an extremely simple yet effective approach to alleviate the recency
bias in visual token pruning. We propose a straightforward reweighting
mechanism that adjusts the attention scores of visual tokens according to their
spatial positions in the image. Our method, termed Position-reweighted Visual
Token Pruning, is a plug-and-play solution that can be seamlessly incorporated
into existing visual token pruning frameworks without any changes to the model
architecture or extra training. Extensive experiments on LVLMs demonstrate that
our method improves the performance of visual token pruning with minimal
computational overhead.

Abstract: Existing multi-modal fusion methods typically apply static frame-based image
fusion techniques directly to video fusion tasks, neglecting inherent temporal
dependencies and leading to inconsistent results across frames. To address this
limitation, we propose the first video fusion framework that explicitly
incorporates temporal modeling with visual-semantic collaboration to
simultaneously ensure visual fidelity, semantic accuracy, and temporal
consistency. First, we introduce a visual-semantic interaction module
consisting of a semantic branch and a visual branch, with Dinov2 and VGG19
employed for targeted distillation, allowing simultaneous enhancement of both
the visual and semantic representations. Second, we pioneer integrate the video
degradation enhancement task into the video fusion pipeline by constructing a
temporal cooperative module, which leverages temporal dependencies to
facilitate weak information recovery. Third, to ensure temporal consistency, we
embed a temporal-enhanced mechanism into the network and devise a temporal loss
to guide the optimization process. Finally, we introduce two innovative
evaluation metrics tailored for video fusion, aimed at assessing the temporal
consistency of the generated fused videos. Extensive experimental results on
public video datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our code is

Abstract: Industrial and medical anomaly detection faces critical challenges from data
scarcity and prohibitive annotation costs, particularly in evolving
manufacturing and healthcare settings. To address this, we propose CoZAD, a
novel zero-shot anomaly detection framework that integrates soft confident
learning with meta-learning and contrastive feature representation. Unlike
traditional confident learning that discards uncertain samples, our method
assigns confidence-based weights to all training data, preserving boundary
information while emphasizing prototypical normal patterns. The framework
quantifies data uncertainty through IQR-based thresholding and model
uncertainty via covariance based regularization within a Model-Agnostic
Meta-Learning. Contrastive learning creates discriminative feature spaces where
normal patterns form compact clusters, enabling rapid domain adaptation.
Comprehensive evaluation across 10 datasets spanning industrial and medical
domains demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing
methods on 6 out of 7 industrial benchmarks with notable improvements on
texture-rich datasets (99.2% I-AUROC on DTD-Synthetic, 97.2% on BTAD) and
pixellevel localization (96.3% P-AUROC on MVTec-AD). The framework eliminates
dependence on vision-language alignments or model ensembles, making it valuable
for resourceconstrained environments requiring rapid deployment.

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene generation is crucial for virtual reality, interior
design, embodied intelligence, and scene understanding. While existing methods
have made progress in coarse-scale furniture arrangement, they struggle to
capture fine-grained object placements, limiting the realism and utility of
generated environments. This gap hinders immersive virtual experiences and
detailed scene comprehension for embodied AI applications. To address these
issues, we propose Hierarchical Layout Generation (HLG), a novel method for
fine-grained 3D scene generation. HLG is the first to adopt a coarse-to-fine
hierarchical approach, refining scene layouts from large-scale furniture
placement to intricate object arrangements. Specifically, our fine-grained
layout alignment module constructs a hierarchical layout through vertical and
horizontal decoupling, effectively decomposing complex 3D indoor scenes into
multiple levels of granularity. Additionally, our trainable layout optimization
network addresses placement issues, such as incorrect positioning, orientation
errors, and object intersections, ensuring structurally coherent and physically
plausible scene generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
through extensive experiments, showing superior performance in generating
realistic indoor scenes compared to existing methods. This work advances the
field of scene generation and opens new possibilities for applications
requiring detailed 3D environments. We will release our code upon publication
to encourage future research.

Abstract: The difficulty of pixel-level annotation has significantly hindered the
development of the Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) field. To save on
annotation costs, previous works leverage the semi-supervised COD framework
that relies on a small number of labeled data and a large volume of unlabeled
data. We argue that there is still significant room for improvement in the
effective utilization of unlabeled data. To this end, we introduce a
Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection by Utilizing Text and Adaptive
Data Selection (SCOUT). It includes an Adaptive Data Augment and Selection
(ADAS) module and a Text Fusion Module (TFM). The ADSA module selects valuable
data for annotation through an adversarial augment and sampling strategy. The
TFM module further leverages the selected valuable data by combining
camouflage-related knowledge and text-visual interaction. To adapt to this
work, we build a new dataset, namely RefTextCOD. Extensive experiments show
that the proposed method surpasses previous semi-supervised methods in the COD
field and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be released at
https://github.com/Heartfirey/SCOUT.

Conclusion: DiffAug框架通过文本引导的扩散生成和自动验证机制，有效解决了医学图像中罕见异常分割的数据稀缺问题，显著提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation models struggle with rare abnormalities due to
scarce annotated pathological data. We propose DiffAug a novel framework that
combines textguided diffusion-based generation with automatic segmentation
validation to address this challenge. Our proposed approach uses latent
diffusion models conditioned on medical text descriptions and spatial masks to
synthesize abnormalities via inpainting on normal images. Generated samples
undergo dynamic quality validation through a latentspace segmentation network
that ensures accurate localization while enabling single-step inference. The
text prompts, derived from medical literature, guide the generation of diverse
abnormality types without requiring manual annotation. Our validation mechanism
filters synthetic samples based on spatial accuracy, maintaining quality while
operating efficiently through direct latent estimation. Evaluated on three
medical imaging benchmarks (CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, REFUGE2), our framework
achieves state-of-the-art performance with 8-10% Dice improvements over
baselines and reduces false negative rates by up to 28% for challenging cases
like small polyps and flat lesions critical for early detection in screening
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ATLaS方法，通过交替使用one-hot标签和标签平滑生成的软标签来训练提示调优，解决了传统标签平滑在提示调优中泛化能力下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管提示调优是参数高效的精调方法，但其泛化能力有限。标签平滑作为有效的正则化技术可以提升泛化能力，但在提示调优中直接使用反而会削弱性能。

Method: 提出交替训练标签平滑(ATLaS)方法，交替使用标准one-hot标签和标签平滑生成的软标签来监督提示调优。同时引入类级别软标签(CSL)和实例级别软标签(ISL)来提供类间或实例-类关系。

Result: 大量实验表明ATLaS方法结合CSL和ISL能够持续提升提示调优的泛化性能，且与主流提示调优方法具有高度兼容性。

Conclusion: ATLaS方法有效解决了标签平滑在提示调优中的负面影响，通过交替训练策略和高效离线软标签显著提升了提示调优的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained vision-language models have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities. To further enhance these
models' adaptability to various downstream tasks, prompt tuning has emerged as
a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. However, despite its efficiency, the
generalization ability of prompt remains limited. In contrast, label smoothing
(LS) has been widely recognized as an effective regularization technique that
prevents models from becoming over-confident and improves their generalization.
This inspires us to explore the integration of LS with prompt tuning. However,
we have observed that the vanilla LS even weakens the generalization ability of
prompt tuning. To address this issue, we propose the Alternating Training-based
Label Smoothing (ATLaS) method, which alternately trains with standard one-hot
labels and soft labels generated by LS to supervise the prompt tuning.
Moreover, we introduce two types of efficient offline soft labels, including
Class-wise Soft Labels (CSL) and Instance-wise Soft Labels (ISL), to provide
inter-class or instance-class relationships for prompt tuning. The theoretical
properties of the proposed ATLaS method are analyzed. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed ATLaS method, combined with CSL and ISL,
consistently enhances the generalization performance of prompt tuning.
Moreover, the proposed ATLaS method exhibits high compatibility with prevalent
prompt tuning methods, enabling seamless integration into existing methods.

Motivation: 目标检测需要昂贵的边界框标注，主动学习可以减轻标注负担。在目标检测的框级主动学习中，早期模型只能对多数类表现良好，导致伪标签严重类别不平衡

Result: 在公共基准数据集上评估，方法达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 提出的类别平衡采样和软伪标签策略能够有效解决目标检测主动学习中的类别不平衡问题，显著提升模型性能

Abstract: Training deep object detectors demands expensive bounding box annotation.
Active learning (AL) is a promising technique to alleviate the annotation
burden. Performing AL at box-level for object detection, i.e., selecting the
most informative boxes to label and supplementing the sparsely-labelled image
with pseudo labels, has been shown to be more cost-effective than selecting and
labelling the entire image. In box-level AL for object detection, we observe
that models at early stage can only perform well on majority classes, making
the pseudo labels severely class-imbalanced. We propose a class-balanced
sampling strategy to select more objects from minority classes for labelling,
so as to make the final training data, \ie, ground truth labels obtained by AL
and pseudo labels, more class-balanced to train a better model. We also propose
a task-aware soft pseudo labelling strategy to increase the accuracy of pseudo
labels. We evaluate our method on public benchmarking datasets and show that
our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 提出基于3D高斯泼溅的相机位姿优化框架GS-SMC，通过渲染多视角图像建立对极几何约束，无需重新训练即可应用于不同场景，在多个数据集上显著超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有相机位姿优化方法依赖特定描述符或需要重新训练网络，缺乏几何约束导致精度不足，需要一种轻量级且无需重新训练的通用解决方案。

Method: 利用现有3DGS模型渲染新视角图像，通过迭代优化方法使用查询图像与多个渲染图像间的对极几何约束来优化相机位姿，可灵活选择特征提取器和匹配器。

Result: 在7-Scenes数据集上平移和旋转误差中位数分别降低53.3%和56.9%，在Cambridge Landmarks数据集上分别降低40.7%和53.2%，显著优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: GS-SMC框架提供了一种无需重新训练、可灵活应用不同特征提取器的相机位姿优化方案，通过几何约束显著提升了位姿估计精度。

Abstract: Camera pose refinement aims at improving the accuracy of initial pose
estimation for applications in 3D computer vision. Most refinement approaches
rely on 2D-3D correspondences with specific descriptors or dedicated networks,
requiring reconstructing the scene again for a different descriptor or fully
retraining the network for each scene. Some recent methods instead infer pose
from feature similarity, but their lack of geometry constraints results in less
accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel camera pose
refinement framework leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), referred to as
GS-SMC. Given the widespread usage of 3DGS, our method can employ an existing
3DGS model to render novel views, providing a lightweight solution that can be
directly applied to diverse scenes without additional training or fine-tuning.
Specifically, we introduce an iterative optimization approach, which refines
the camera pose using epipolar geometric constraints among the query and
multiple rendered images. Our method allows flexibly choosing feature
extractors and matchers to establish these constraints. Extensive empirical
evaluations on the 7-Scenes and the Cambridge Landmarks datasets demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art camera pose refinement approaches,
achieving 53.3% and 56.9% reductions in median translation and rotation errors
on 7-Scenes, and 40.7% and 53.2% on Cambridge.

Conclusion: ISALux通过有效整合光照和语义先验，在低光照图像增强任务中表现出色，消融研究验证了各组件的重要性。

Abstract: We introduce ISALux, a novel transformer-based approach for Low-Light Image
Enhancement (LLIE) that seamlessly integrates illumination and semantic priors.
Our architecture includes an original self-attention block, Hybrid Illumination
and Semantics-Aware Multi-Headed Self- Attention (HISA-MSA), which integrates
illumination and semantic segmentation maps for en- hanced feature extraction.
ISALux employs two self-attention modules to independently process illumination
and semantic features, selectively enriching each other to regulate luminance
and high- light structural variations in real-world scenarios. A Mixture of
Experts (MoE)-based Feed-Forward Network (FFN) enhances contextual learning,
with a gating mechanism conditionally activating the top K experts for
specialized processing. To address overfitting in LLIE methods caused by
distinct light patterns in benchmarking datasets, we enhance the HISA-MSA
module with low-rank matrix adaptations (LoRA). Extensive qualitative and
quantitative evaluations across multiple specialized datasets demonstrate that
ISALux is competitive with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Addition- ally, an
ablation study highlights the contribution of each component in the proposed
model. Code will be released upon publication.

Abstract: Prompting is fundamental to unlocking the full potential of large language
models. To automate and enhance this process, automatic prompt optimization
(APO) has been developed, demonstrating effectiveness primarily in text-only
input scenarios. However, extending existing APO methods to multimodal tasks,
such as video-language generation introduces two core challenges: (i) visual
token inflation, where long visual token sequences restrict context capacity
and result in insufficient feedback signals; (ii) a lack of process-level
supervision, as existing methods focus on outcome-level supervision and
overlook intermediate supervision, limiting prompt optimization. We present
UniAPO: Unified Multimodal Automated Prompt Optimization, the first framework
tailored for multimodal APO. UniAPO adopts an EM-inspired optimization process
that decouples feedback modeling and prompt refinement, making the optimization
more stable and goal-driven. To further address the aforementioned challenges,
we introduce a short-long term memory mechanism: historical feedback mitigates
context limitations, while historical prompts provide directional guidance for
effective prompt optimization. UniAPO achieves consistent gains across text,
image, and video benchmarks, establishing a unified framework for efficient and
transferable prompt optimization.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a foundational component for 3D reconstruction in
minimally invasive endoscopic surgeries. However, existing monocular depth
estimation techniques often exhibit limited performance to the varying
illumination and complex textures of the surgical environment. While powerful
visual foundation models offer a promising solution, their training on natural
images leads to significant domain adaptability limitations and semantic
perception deficiencies when applied to endoscopy. In this study, we introduce
EndoUFM, an unsupervised monocular depth estimation framework that innovatively
integrating dual foundation models for surgical scenes, which enhance the depth
estimation performance by leveraging the powerful pre-learned priors. The
framework features a novel adaptive fine-tuning strategy that incorporates
Random Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (RVLoRA) to enhance model adaptability, and a
Residual block based on Depthwise Separable Convolution (Res-DSC) to improve
the capture of fine-grained local features. Furthermore, we design a
mask-guided smoothness loss to enforce depth consistency within anatomical
tissue structures. Extensive experiments on the SCARED, Hamlyn, SERV-CT, and
EndoNeRF datasets confirm that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
while maintaining an efficient model size. This work contributes to augmenting
surgeons' spatial perception during minimally invasive procedures, thereby
enhancing surgical precision and safety, with crucial implications for
augmented reality and navigation systems.

Abstract: Progress in remote PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (rPPG) is limited by the critical
issues of existing publicly available datasets: small size, privacy concerns
with facial videos, and lack of diversity in conditions. The paper introduces a
novel comprehensive large-scale multi-view video dataset for rPPG and health
biomarkers estimation. Our dataset comprises 3600 synchronized video recordings
from 600 subjects, captured under varied conditions (resting and post-exercise)

analysis of physiological states, each recording is paired with a 100 Hz PPG
signal and extended health metrics, such as electrocardiogram, arterial blood
pressure, biomarkers, temperature, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and
stress level. Using this data, we train an efficient rPPG model and compare its
quality with existing approaches in cross-dataset scenarios. The public release
of our dataset and model should significantly speed up the progress in the

Abstract: This study aims to investigate the effect of various beam geometries and
dimensions of input data on the sparse-sampling streak artifact correction task
with U-Nets for clinical CT scans as a means of incorporating the volumetric
context into artifact reduction tasks to improve model performance. A total of
22 subjects were retrospectively selected (01.2016-12.2018) from the Technical
University of Munich's research hospital, TUM Klinikum rechts der Isar.
Sparsely-sampled CT volumes were simulated with the Astra toolbox for parallel,
fan, and cone beam geometries. 2048 views were taken as full-view scans. 2D and
3D U-Nets were trained and validated on 14, and tested on 8 subjects,
respectively. For the dimensionality study, in addition to the 512x512 2D CT
images, the CT scans were further pre-processed to generate a so-called '2.5D',
and 3D data: Each CT volume was divided into 64x64x64 voxel blocks. The 3D data
refers to individual 64-voxel blocks. An axial, coronal, and sagittal cut
through the center of each block resulted in three 64x64 2D patches that were
rearranged as a single 64x64x3 image, proposed as 2.5D data. Model performance
was assessed with the mean squared error (MSE) and structural similarity index
measure (SSIM). For all geometries, the 2D U-Net trained on axial 2D slices
results in the best MSE and SSIM values, outperforming the 2.5D and 3D input
data dimensions.

Abstract: Scene regression methods, such as VGGT, solve the Structure-from-Motion (SfM)
problem by directly regressing camera poses and 3D scene structures from input
images. They demonstrate impressive performance in handling images under
extreme viewpoint changes. However, these methods struggle to handle a large
number of input images. To address this problem, we introduce SAIL-Recon, a
feed-forward Transformer for large scale SfM, by augmenting the scene
regression network with visual localization capabilities. Specifically, our
method first computes a neural scene representation from a subset of anchor
images. The regression network is then fine-tuned to reconstruct all input
images conditioned on this neural scene representation. Comprehensive
experiments show that our method not only scales efficiently to large-scale
scenes, but also achieves state-of-the-art results on both camera pose
estimation and novel view synthesis benchmarks, including TUM-RGBD, CO3Dv2, and
Tanks & Temples. We will publish our model and code. Code and models are

Abstract: The use of computer vision in automotive is a trending research in which
safety and security are a primary concern. In particular, for autonomous
driving, preventing road accidents requires highly accurate object detection
under diverse conditions. To address this issue, recently the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO) released the 8800 norm, providing
structured frameworks for managing associated AI relevant risks. However,
challenging scenarios such as adverse weather or low lighting often introduce
data drift, leading to degraded model performance and potential safety
violations. In this work, we present a novel hybrid computer vision
architecture trained with thousands of synthetic image data from the road
environment to improve robustness in unseen drifted environments. Our dual mode
framework utilized YOLO version 8 for swift detection and incorporated a
five-layer CNN for verification. The system functioned in sequence and improved
the detection accuracy by more than 90\% when tested with drift-augmented road
images. The focus was to demonstrate how such a hybrid model can provide better
road safety when working together in a hybrid structure.

Abstract: The increasing sophistication of image manipulation techniques demands robust
forensic solutions that can both reliably detect alterations and precisely
localize tampered regions. Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show
promise by leveraging world knowledge and semantic understanding for
context-aware detection, yet they struggle with perceiving subtle, low-level
forensic artifacts crucial for accurate manipulation localization. This paper
presents a novel Propose-Rectify framework that effectively bridges semantic
reasoning with forensic-specific analysis. In the proposal stage, our approach
utilizes a forensic-adapted LLaVA model to generate initial manipulation
analysis and preliminary localization of suspicious regions based on semantic
understanding and contextual reasoning. In the rectification stage, we
introduce a Forensics Rectification Module that systematically validates and
refines these initial proposals through multi-scale forensic feature analysis,
integrating technical evidence from several specialized filters. Additionally,
we present an Enhanced Segmentation Module that incorporates critical forensic
cues into SAM's encoded image embeddings, thereby overcoming inherent semantic
biases to achieve precise delineation of manipulated regions. By
synergistically combining advanced multimodal reasoning with established
forensic methodologies, our framework ensures that initial semantic proposals
are systematically validated and enhanced through concrete technical evidence,
resulting in comprehensive detection accuracy and localization precision.
Extensive experimental validation demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
across diverse datasets with exceptional robustness and generalization
capabilities.

Conclusion: CDD框架有效解决了FUAD设置下知识蒸馏学习异常表示的问题，验证了其在完全无监督异常检测中的有效性

Abstract: Fully Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (FUAD) is a practical extension of
Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD), aiming to detect anomalies without any
labels even when the training set may contain anomalous samples. To achieve
FUAD, we pioneer the introduction of Knowledge Distillation (KD) paradigm based
on teacher-student framework into the FUAD setting. However, due to the
presence of anomalies in the training data, traditional KD methods risk
enabling the student to learn the teacher's representation of anomalies under
FUAD setting, thereby resulting in poor anomaly detection performance. To
address this issue, we propose a novel Cross-Domain Distillation (CDD)
framework based on the widely studied reverse distillation (RD) paradigm.
Specifically, we design a Domain-Specific Training, which divides the training
set into multiple domains with lower anomaly ratios and train a domain-specific
student for each. Cross-Domain Knowledge Aggregation is then performed, where
pseudo-normal features generated by domain-specific students collaboratively
guide a global student to learn generalized normal representations across all
samples. Experimental results on noisy versions of the MVTec AD and VisA
datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance
improvements over the baseline, validating its effectiveness under FUAD
setting.

Conclusion: 首次使用2D X射线作为颅骨表示进行颅面重建，为法医鉴定提供了创新的自动化解决方案

Abstract: Craniofacial reconstruction in forensics is one of the processes to identify
victims of crime and natural disasters. Identifying an individual from their
remains plays a crucial role when all other identification methods fail.
Traditional methods for this task, such as clay-based craniofacial
reconstruction, require expert domain knowledge and are a time-consuming
process. At the same time, other probabilistic generative models like the
statistical shape model or the Basel face model fail to capture the skull and
face cross-domain attributes. Looking at these limitations, we propose a
generic framework for craniofacial reconstruction from 2D X-ray images. Here,
we used various generative models (i.e., CycleGANs, cGANs, etc) and fine-tune
the generator and discriminator parts to generate more realistic images in two
distinct domains, which are the skull and face of an individual. This is the
first time where 2D X-rays are being used as a representation of the skull by
generative models for craniofacial reconstruction. We have evaluated the
quality of generated faces using FID, IS, and SSIM scores. Finally, we have
proposed a retrieval framework where the query is the generated face image and
the gallery is the database of real faces. By experimental results, we have
found that this can be an effective tool for forensic science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自回归文本到图像生成模型在处理多属性和模糊提示时能力有限，且大多数模型只在生成阶段结束时提供奖励信号，难以识别哪些阶段对最终结果有积极贡献，导致策略次优。

Method: 提出Visual-CoG范式，包含语义推理、过程精炼和结果评估三个阶段，通过阶段感知奖励在整个图像生成流程中提供即时指导。

Result: 在GenEval、T2I-CompBench和提出的VisCog-Bench基准测试中分别实现了15%、5%和19%的性能提升。

Conclusion: Visual-CoG通过阶段感知奖励机制有效提升了文本到图像生成的质量和推理能力，在多属性提示处理方面表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Despite the promising progress of recent autoregressive models in
text-to-image (T2I) generation, their ability to handle multi-attribute and
ambiguous prompts remains limited. To address these limitations, existing works
have applied chain-of-thought (CoT) to enable stage-aware visual synthesis and
employed reinforcement learning (RL) to improve reasoning capabilities.
However, most models provide reward signals only at the end of the generation
stage. This monolithic final-only guidance makes it difficult to identify which
stages contribute positively to the final outcome and may lead to suboptimal
policies. To tackle this issue, we propose a Visual-Chain of Guidance
(Visual-CoG) paradigm consisting of three stages: semantic reasoning, process
refining, and outcome evaluation, with stage-aware rewards providing immediate
guidance throughout the image generation pipeline. We further construct a
visual cognition benchmark, VisCog-Bench, which comprises four subtasks to
evaluate the effectiveness of semantic reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations on
GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and the proposed VisCog-Bench show improvements of 15%,
5%, and 19%, respectively, demonstrating the superior performance of the
proposed Visual-CoG. We will release all the resources soon.

Conclusion: 受百眼巨人感知策略启发的ArgusCogito框架通过跨模态协同和全方位推理，成功解决了伪装目标分割的挑战，展现出优异的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS) poses a significant challenge due to
the intrinsic high similarity between targets and backgrounds, demanding models
capable of profound holistic understanding beyond superficial cues. Prevailing
methods, often limited by shallow feature representation, inadequate reasoning
mechanisms, and weak cross-modal integration, struggle to achieve this depth of
cognition, resulting in prevalent issues like incomplete target separation and
imprecise segmentation. Inspired by the perceptual strategy of the Hundred-eyed
Giant-emphasizing holistic observation, omnidirectional focus, and intensive
scrutiny-we introduce ArgusCogito, a novel zero-shot, chain-of-thought
framework underpinned by cross-modal synergy and omnidirectional reasoning
within Vision-Language Models (VLMs). ArgusCogito orchestrates three
cognitively-inspired stages: (1) Conjecture: Constructs a strong cognitive
prior through global reasoning with cross-modal fusion (RGB, depth, semantic
maps), enabling holistic scene understanding and enhanced target-background
disambiguation. (2) Focus: Performs omnidirectional, attention-driven scanning
and focused reasoning, guided by semantic priors from Conjecture, enabling
precise target localization and region-of-interest refinement. (3) Sculpting:
Progressively sculpts high-fidelity segmentation masks by integrating
cross-modal information and iteratively generating dense positive/negative
point prompts within focused regions, emulating Argus' intensive scrutiny.
Extensive evaluations on four challenging COS benchmarks and three Medical
Image Segmentation (MIS) benchmarks demonstrate that ArgusCogito achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, validating the framework's exceptional
efficacy, superior generalization capability, and robustness.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing (RS) images is pivotal for
comprehensive Earth observation, but the demand for interpreting new object
categories, coupled with the high expense of manual annotation, poses
significant challenges. Although open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS)
offers a promising solution, existing frameworks designed for natural images
are insufficient for the unique complexities of RS data. They struggle with
vast scale variations and fine-grained details, and their adaptation often
relies on extensive, costly annotations. To address this critical gap, this
paper introduces SegEarth-OV, the first framework for annotation-free
open-vocabulary segmentation of RS images. Specifically, we propose SimFeatUp,
a universal upsampler that robustly restores high-resolution spatial details
from coarse features, correcting distorted target shapes without any
task-specific post-training. We also present a simple yet effective Global Bias
Alleviation operation to subtract the inherent global context from patch
features, significantly enhancing local semantic fidelity. These components
empower SegEarth-OV to effectively harness the rich semantics of pre-trained
VLMs, making OVSS possible in optical RS contexts. Furthermore, to extend the
framework's universality to other challenging RS modalities like SAR images,
where large-scale VLMs are unavailable and expensive to create, we introduce
AlignEarth, which is a distillation-based strategy and can efficiently transfer
semantic knowledge from an optical VLM encoder to an SAR encoder, bypassing the
need to build SAR foundation models from scratch and enabling universal OVSS
across diverse sensor types. Extensive experiments on both optical and SAR
datasets validate that SegEarth-OV can achieve dramatic improvements over the
SOTA methods, establishing a robust foundation for annotation-free and
open-world Earth observation.

TL;DR: EventTracer是一个基于路径追踪的渲染流水线，通过低SPP路径追踪加速渲染，并使用轻量级脉冲网络去噪生成高保真事件序列，实现了4分钟/秒720p视频的高效物理感知事件模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事件流模拟方法通常使用无噪声RGB帧，渲染成本高且时间分辨率低（100-300 FPS），远低于真实事件数据。需要一种高效且物理感知的方法来生成大规模、高时间频率的事件数据。

Method: 采用低样本每像素（SPP）路径追踪加速渲染，训练轻量级事件脉冲网络进行去噪。网络配备双极泄漏积分发放（BiLIF）脉冲单元，使用双向地球移动距离（EMD）损失进行训练。

Result: EventTracer流水线运行速度约为4分钟/秒720p视频，继承了路径追踪的精确时空建模优势。在下游任务中显示出比其他事件模拟器更好的场景细节捕捉能力和与真实事件数据的相似性。

Conclusion: EventTracer是一个有前景的工具，能够以低成本创建大规模事件-RGB数据集，缩小事件视觉中的模拟到真实差距，并推动机器人、自动驾驶和VR/AR等应用场景的发展。

Abstract: Simulating event streams from 3D scenes has become a common practice in
event-based vision research, as it meets the demand for large-scale, high
temporal frequency data without setting up expensive hardware devices or
undertaking extensive data collections. Yet existing methods in this direction
typically work with noiseless RGB frames that are costly to render, and
therefore they can only achieve a temporal resolution equivalent to 100-300
FPS, far lower than that of real-world event data. In this work, we propose
EventTracer, a path tracing-based rendering pipeline that simulates
high-fidelity event sequences from complex 3D scenes in an efficient and
physics-aware manner. Specifically, we speed up the rendering process via low
sample-per-pixel (SPP) path tracing, and train a lightweight event spiking
network to denoise the resulting RGB videos into realistic event sequences. To
capture the physical properties of event streams, the network is equipped with
a bipolar leaky integrate-and-fired (BiLIF) spiking unit and trained with a
bidirectional earth mover distance (EMD) loss. Our EventTracer pipeline runs at
a speed of about 4 minutes per second of 720p video, and it inherits the merit
of accurate spatiotemporal modeling from its path tracing backbone. We show in
two downstream tasks that EventTracer captures better scene details and
demonstrates a greater similarity to real-world event data than other event
simulators, which establishes it as a promising tool for creating large-scale
event-RGB datasets at a low cost, narrowing the sim-to-real gap in event-based
vision, and boosting various application scenarios such as robotics, autonomous
driving, and VRAR.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效发现未知类别，为开放集少样本高光谱图像分类提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Open-set few-shot hyperspectral image (HSI) classification aims to classify
image pixels by using few labeled pixels per class, where the pixels to be
classified may be not all from the classes that have been seen. To address the
open-set HSI classification challenge, current methods focus mainly on
distinguishing the unknown class samples from the known class samples and
rejecting them to increase the accuracy of identifying known class samples.
They fails to further identify or discovery the unknow classes among the
samples. This paper proposes a prototype learning and clustering method for
discoverying unknown classes in HSIs under the few-shot environment. Using few
labeled samples, it strives to develop the ability of infering the prototypes
of unknown classes while distinguishing unknown classes from known classes.
Once the unknown class samples are rejected by the learned known class
classifier, the proposed method can further cluster the unknown class samples
into different classes according to their distance to the inferred unknown
class prototypes. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, extensive
experiments on four benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that our proposed method
exhibits competitive performance in open-set few-shot HSI classification tasks.

Abstract: This paper aims to unify Score-based Generative Models (SGMs), also known as
Diffusion models, and the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) problem through three
reparameterization techniques: Iterative Proportional Mean-Matching (IPMM),
Iterative Proportional Terminus-Matching (IPTM), and Iterative Proportional
Flow-Matching (IPFM). These techniques significantly accelerate and stabilize
the training of SB-based models. Furthermore, the paper introduces novel
initialization strategies that use pre-trained SGMs to effectively train
SB-based models. By using SGMs as initialization, we leverage the advantages of
both SB-based models and SGMs, ensuring efficient training of SB-based models
and further improving the performance of SGMs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the significant effectiveness and improvements of the proposed
methods. We believe this work contributes to and paves the way for future
research on generative models.

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are vital for training segmentation models, but
pixel-level labeling is time-consuming, error-prone, and often requires scarce
expert annotators, especially in medical imaging. In contrast, coarse
annotations are quicker, cheaper, and easier to produce, even by non-experts.
In this paper, we propose to use coarse drawings from both positive (target)
and negative (background) classes in the image, even with noisy pixels, to
train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for semantic segmentation. We
present a method for learning the true segmentation label distributions from
purely noisy coarse annotations using two coupled CNNs. The separation of the
two CNNs is achieved by high fidelity with the characters of the noisy training
annotations. We propose to add a complementary label learning that encourages
estimating negative label distribution. To illustrate the properties of our
method, we first use a toy segmentation dataset based on MNIST. We then present
the quantitative results of experiments using publicly available datasets:
Cityscapes dataset for multi-class segmentation, and retinal images for medical
applications. In all experiments, our method outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, particularly in the cases where the ratio of coarse annotations is
small compared to the given dense annotations.

Conclusion: 该方法通过扩散模型和几何指导的优化循环，实现了高质量的手持物体3D重建，解决了现有方法的局限性

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for reconstructing 3D geometry
of hand-held objects from monocular RGB images by leveraging hand-object
interaction as geometric guidance. Our method conditions a latent diffusion
model on an inpainted object appearance and uses inference-time guidance to
optimize the object reconstruction, while simultaneously ensuring plausible
hand-object interactions. Unlike prior methods that rely on extensive
post-processing or produce low-quality reconstructions, our approach directly
generates high-quality object geometry during the diffusion process by
introducing guidance with an optimization-in-the-loop design. Specifically, we
guide the diffusion model by applying supervision to the velocity field while
simultaneously optimizing the transformations of both the hand and the object
being reconstructed. This optimization is driven by multi-modal geometric cues,
including normal and depth alignment, silhouette consistency, and 2D keypoint
reprojection. We further incorporate signed distance field supervision and
enforce contact and non-intersection constraints to ensure physical
plausibility of hand-object interaction. Our method yields accurate, robust and
coherent reconstructions under occlusion while generalizing well to in-the-wild
scenarios.

TL;DR: GM-Skip是一个用于Transformer块跳过的灵活框架，通过度量引导的贪婪选择和反向删除机制，在保持输出质量的同时加速视觉语言模型的推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Transformer的视觉语言模型虽然性能出色，但计算成本高，难以部署在延迟敏感的自动驾驶等应用中，需要一种既能加速推理又能保持性能的方法。

Method: 采用贪婪的度量引导块选择策略，利用度量反馈识别冗余层，结合反向顺序删除机制保留早期基础块，并通过可调节的稀疏度-性能平衡目标支持不同部署需求。

Result: 在COCO数据集上，GM-Skip将Person类别的单目标分类准确率从19.1%提升到87.3%，同时跳过超过40%的Transformer块。在真实自动驾驶系统中实现45.4%的延迟降低。

Conclusion: GM-Skip框架有效加速了视觉语言模型的推理速度，在保持任务性能的同时显著减少计算延迟，在真实世界部署中验证了其实用价值。

Abstract: Transformer-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive
performance on tasks such as image captioning, object recognition, and visual
reasoning, but their high computational cost hinders deployment in
latency-sensitive applications like autonomous driving. We introduce GM-Skip, a
flexible and metric-adaptive framework for Transformer block skipping that
accelerates VLM inference while preserving output quality. GM-Skip features a
greedy, metric-guided block selection strategy that uses metric feedback (e.g.,
accuracy, CIDEr) to identify redundant layers, along with a reverse-order
deletion mechanism that preserves early foundational blocks to avoid
performance collapse. To support diverse deployment needs, it incorporates a
tunable trade-off between sparsity and performance via a score-sparsity balance
objective. Experiments across multiple tasks and datasets, including COCO and
CODA, show that GM-Skip consistently improves inference speed while maintaining
task performance. On the COCO dataset, GM-Skip improves single-object
classification accuracy on the Person category from 19.1 percent to 87.3
percent while skipping more than 40 percent of Transformer blocks. In
real-world deployment, it achieves up to 45.4 percent latency reduction on
single-object detection when integrated into an autonomous vehicle running
Autoware.Universe, validating the effectiveness of its skip configurations and
confirming its practical value in accelerating real-world inference.

TL;DR: SKD-CAG方法通过选择性遗忘技术，有效消除文本到图像扩散模型中的后门攻击，在保持图像质量的同时实现高精度后门移除。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型易受后门攻击，攻击者可通过注入不可察觉的文本触发器操控模型输出。现有防御方法主要针对分类模型，生成模型缺乏有效的后门防御技术。

Method: 提出自知识蒸馏与交叉注意力引导(SKD-CAG)方法，利用知识蒸馏引导模型修正对中毒提示的响应，通过交叉注意力机制在注意力层面消除后门影响。

Result: 实验显示该方法显著优于现有方法，像素后门移除准确率达100%，风格攻击移除准确率达93%，且不牺牲模型鲁棒性或图像保真度。

Conclusion: 选择性遗忘技术是保护生成模型安全的有前景的防御策略，SKD-CAG方法为文本到图像扩散模型提供了有效的后门防御解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized generative AI, but their
vulnerability to backdoor attacks poses significant security risks. Adversaries
can inject imperceptible textual triggers into training data, causing models to
generate manipulated outputs. Although text-based backdoor defenses in
classification models are well-explored, generative models lack effective
mitigation techniques against. We address this by selectively erasing the
model's learned associations between adversarial text triggers and poisoned
outputs, while preserving overall generation quality. Our approach,
Self-Knowledge Distillation with Cross-Attention Guidance (SKD-CAG), uses
knowledge distillation to guide the model in correcting responses to poisoned
prompts while maintaining image quality by exploiting the fact that the
backdoored model still produces clean outputs in the absence of triggers. Using
the cross-attention mechanism, SKD-CAG neutralizes backdoor influences at the
attention level, ensuring the targeted removal of adversarial effects.
Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches,
achieving removal accuracy 100\% for pixel backdoors and 93\% for style-based
attacks, without sacrificing robustness or image fidelity. Our findings
highlight targeted unlearning as a promising defense to secure generative
models. Code and model weights can be found at

TL;DR: LanSE是一个新的评估框架，通过识别可解释的视觉模式并用自然语言描述，为AI生成图像提供细粒度评估，包括提示匹配、视觉真实感、物理合理性和内容多样性四个维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成内容评估指标过于粗糙，无法识别具体优缺点，限制了模型选择和科学理解。需要更细粒度的可解释评估方法。

Method: 提出Language-Grounded Sparse Encoders (LanSE)架构，通过大规模人工评估（11,000+标注）和多模态模型分析，识别可解释视觉模式。

Result: LanSE在自然图像中检测可解释视觉模式的准确率超过93%，能够揭示现有指标无法发现的模型细微差异，如FLUX的物理合理性优势和SDXL-medium的内容多样性优势。

Conclusion: LanSE通过将可解释性与实际评估需求结合，为生成AI模型用户提供了强大的模型选择、质量控制和模型改进工具，有助于建立公众对AI生成内容的信心和安全。

Abstract: While the quality of AI-generated contents, such as synthetic images, has
become remarkably high, current evaluation metrics provide only coarse-grained
assessments, failing to identify specific strengths and weaknesses that
researchers and practitioners need for model selection and development, further
limiting the scientific understanding and commercial deployment of these
generative models. To address this, we introduce Language-Grounded Sparse
Encoders (LanSE), a novel architecture that creates interpretable evaluation
metrics by identifying interpretable visual patterns and automatically
describing them in natural language. Through large-scale human evaluation (more
than 11,000 annotations) and large multimodal model (LMM) based analysis, LanSE
demonstrates reliable capabilities to detect interpretable visual patterns in
synthetic images with more than 93\% accuracy in natural images. LanSE further
provides a fine-grained evaluation framework that quantifies four key
dimensions of generation quality, prompt match, visual realism, physical
plausibility, and content diversity. LanSE reveals nuanced model differences
invisible to existing metrics, for instance, FLUX's superior physical
plausibility and SDXL-medium's strong content diversity, while aligning with
human judgments. By bridging interpretability with practical evaluation needs,
LanSE offers all users of generative AI models a powerful tool for model
selection, quality control of synthetic content, and model improvement. These
capabilities directly address the need for public confidence and safety in
AI-generated content, both critical for the future of generative AI
applications.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种轻量化的Transformer基础的3D姿势估计模型，能够在完整和缺失先验知识的各种场景下进行单目摄像头3D重建，计算效率高且准确性超过了现有最佳方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统3D姿势估计模型对摄像机参数和身体细节长度等先验知识的依赖性，让模型能够在无法获得完整先验信息的实际应用场景中使用。

Method: 使用Transformer结构，通过插入掩码机制处理缺失的先验信息，输入包括关节点位置、细节长度和摄像机内参。基于AMASS数据集生成2D合成数据进行训练。

Result: 在GPU上仅需380微秒、CPU上1800微秒的运行时间，3D关节点位置估计准确度达到36mm，比现有最佳方法提升50%，而且在先验信息缺失时仍保持高准确性。

Conclusion: 该模型通过一个网络实现了在完整和缺失先验知识的多种场景下的高效准确3D重建，适用于嵌入式设备和低功耗应用。

Abstract: This paper proposes a new lightweight Transformer-based lifter that maps
short sequences of human 2D joint positions to 3D poses using a single camera.
The proposed model takes as input geometric priors including segment lengths
and camera intrinsics and is designed to operate in both calibrated and
uncalibrated settings. To this end, a masking mechanism enables the model to
ignore missing priors during training and inference. This yields a single
versatile network that can adapt to different deployment scenarios, from fully
calibrated lab environments to in-the-wild monocular videos without
calibration. The model was trained using 3D keypoints from AMASS dataset with
corresponding 2D synthetic data generated by sampling random camera poses and
intrinsics. It was then compared to an expert model trained, only on complete
priors, and the validation was done by conducting an ablation study. Results
show that both, camera and segment length priors, improve performance and that
the versatile model outperforms the expert, even when all priors are available,
and maintains high accuracy when priors are missing. Overall the average 3D
joint center positions estimation accuracy was as low as 36mm improving state
of the art by half a centimeter and at a much lower computational cost. Indeed,
the proposed model runs in 380$\mu$s on GPU and 1800$\mu$s on CPU, making it
suitable for deployment on embedded platforms and low-power devices.

TL;DR: GSVisLoc是一种基于3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)场景表示的视觉定位方法，通过粗匹配、精匹配和姿态细化三个步骤，实现无需修改、重训练或额外参考图像的相机位姿估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉定位方法通常需要特定的场景表示或额外的训练数据，而3DGS作为一种新兴的3D场景表示方法，需要开发能够直接利用其进行视觉定位的技术。

Method: 通过下采样和编码3D高斯生成场景特征，编码图像块获得图像特征，采用三步流程：粗匹配、精匹配和姿态细化，无需修改3DGS表示或额外训练。

Result: 在室内外场景的标准基准测试中表现出竞争性的定位性能，优于现有的3DGS基线方法，并能有效泛化到新场景而无需额外训练。

Conclusion: GSVisLoc成功证明了直接利用3DGS表示进行视觉定位的可行性，为3DGS在视觉定位领域的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce GSVisLoc, a visual localization method designed for 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) scene representations. Given a 3DGS model of a scene and a
query image, our goal is to estimate the camera's position and orientation. We
accomplish this by robustly matching scene features to image features. Scene
features are produced by downsampling and encoding the 3D Gaussians while image
features are obtained by encoding image patches. Our algorithm proceeds in
three steps, starting with coarse matching, then fine matching, and finally by
applying pose refinement for an accurate final estimate. Importantly, our
method leverages the explicit 3DGS scene representation for visual localization
without requiring modifications, retraining, or additional reference images. We
evaluate GSVisLoc on both indoor and outdoor scenes, demonstrating competitive
localization performance on standard benchmarks while outperforming existing
3DGS-based baselines. Moreover, our approach generalizes effectively to novel
scenes without additional training.

TL;DR: 通过多模态覆盖准则选择关键视觉token，在保持VLMs性能的同时大幅提升推理效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉token剧省方法大多仅使用单模态信息，忽视了视视语言任务的多模态特性，导致token选择效果不佳

Method: 提出MMTok方法，将子集选择形式化为最大覆盖问题，同时覆盖文本token和视觉token，使用VLM代理提升文本token质量以指导视觉剧省

Result: 在POPE数据集上实现1.87倍速度提升，保持98.7%原始性能；仅用4个视觉token仍保持87.7%性能，多模态信息结合显著超越单模态基线

Conclusion: 覆盖准则在token选择中具有高效性，多模态信息的结合能够在保持VLMs性能的前提下显著提升推理效率

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive performance in
understanding visual content with language instruction by converting visual
input to vision tokens. However, redundancy in vision tokens results in the
degenerated inference efficiency of VLMs. While many algorithms have been
proposed to reduce the number of vision tokens, most of them apply only
unimodal information (i.e., vision/text) for pruning and ignore the inherent
multimodal property of vision-language tasks. Moreover, it lacks a generic
criterion that can be applied to different modalities. To mitigate this
limitation, in this work, we propose to leverage both vision and text tokens to
select informative vision tokens by the criterion of coverage. We first
formulate the subset selection problem as a maximum coverage problem.
Afterward, a subset of vision tokens is optimized to cover the text tokens and
the original set of vision tokens, simultaneously. Finally, a VLM agent can be
adopted to further improve the quality of text tokens for guiding vision
pruning. The proposed method MMTok is extensively evaluated on benchmark
datasets with different VLMs. The comparison illustrates that vision and text
information are complementary, and combining multimodal information can surpass
the unimodal baseline with a clear margin. Moreover, under the maximum coverage
criterion on the POPE dataset, our method achieves a 1.87x speedup while
maintaining 98.7% of the original performance on LLaVA-NeXT-13B. Furthermore,
with only four vision tokens, it still preserves 87.7% of the original
performance on LLaVA-1.5-7B. These results highlight the effectiveness of
coverage in token selection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决多模态模型在推理能力、效率和部署灵活性方面的挑战，开发一个既能保持高性能又能实现高效推理的开源多模态模型。

Method: 采用级联强化学习框架（离线RL+在线RL两阶段训练）、视觉分辨率路由器（动态调整视觉token分辨率）、解耦视觉语言部署策略（将视觉编码器和语言模型部署在不同GPU上）。

Result: 在MMMU和MathVista等下游推理任务上取得显著提升，整体推理性能提升16%，推理速度加快4.05倍，在开源MLLM中达到最先进水平，接近GPT-5等商业模型的性能。

Conclusion: InternVL 3.5通过创新的训练框架和部署策略，成功实现了性能与效率的平衡，为开源多模态模型树立了新标杆，并支持GUI交互和具身智能等新能力。

Abstract: We introduce InternVL 3.5, a new family of open-source multimodal models that
significantly advances versatility, reasoning capability, and inference
efficiency along the InternVL series. A key innovation is the Cascade
Reinforcement Learning (Cascade RL) framework, which enhances reasoning through
a two-stage process: offline RL for stable convergence and online RL for
refined alignment. This coarse-to-fine training strategy leads to substantial
improvements on downstream reasoning tasks, e.g., MMMU and MathVista. To
optimize efficiency, we propose a Visual Resolution Router (ViR) that
dynamically adjusts the resolution of visual tokens without compromising
performance. Coupled with ViR, our Decoupled Vision-Language Deployment (DvD)
strategy separates the vision encoder and language model across different GPUs,
effectively balancing computational load. These contributions collectively
enable InternVL3.5 to achieve up to a +16.0\% gain in overall reasoning
performance and a 4.05$\times$ inference speedup compared to its predecessor,
i.e., InternVL3. In addition, InternVL3.5 supports novel capabilities such as
GUI interaction and embodied agency. Notably, our largest model, i.e.,
InternVL3.5-241B-A28B, attains state-of-the-art results among open-source MLLMs
across general multimodal, reasoning, text, and agentic tasks -- narrowing the
performance gap with leading commercial models like GPT-5. All models and code
are publicly released.

Motivation: 现有的3D修复方法依赖多视角2D图像修复，导致不同视角间存在不一致性，产生模糊纹理、空间不连续和视觉伪影，影响3D对象补全的准确性和真实感。

Method: 采用最先进的视频编辑模型来填充3D对象的掩码区域，分析3D与视频之间的表示差距，并提出视频修复模型在3D场景修复中的适配方法，同时引入基于参考的3D修复技术以进一步提升重建质量。

Conclusion: 该方法在真实世界3D编辑应用中展现出强大的实际部署潜力，为解决3D修复中的一致性问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D inpainting often relies on multi-view 2D image inpainting, where the
inherent inconsistencies across different inpainted views can result in blurred
textures, spatial discontinuities, and distracting visual artifacts. These
inconsistencies pose significant challenges when striving for accurate and
realistic 3D object completion, particularly in applications that demand high
fidelity and structural coherence. To overcome these limitations, we propose
ObjFiller-3D, a novel method designed for the completion and editing of
high-quality and consistent 3D objects. Instead of employing a conventional 2D
image inpainting model, our approach leverages a curated selection of
state-of-the-art video editing model to fill in the masked regions of 3D
objects. We analyze the representation gap between 3D and videos, and propose
an adaptation of a video inpainting model for 3D scene inpainting. In addition,
we introduce a reference-based 3D inpainting method to further enhance the
quality of reconstruction. Experiments across diverse datasets show that
compared to previous methods, ObjFiller-3D produces more faithful and
fine-grained reconstructions (PSNR of 26.6 vs. NeRFiller (15.9) and LPIPS of
0.19 vs. Instant3dit (0.25)). Moreover, it demonstrates strong potential for
practical deployment in real-world 3D editing applications. Project page:

Motivation: 手动制作高质量提示需要大量领域专业知识且难以扩展，现有自动优化方法要么计算成本高（过度探索），要么容易陷入局部最优（过度利用），需要更好的平衡策略。

Method: 使用多智能体协作工作流：分析智能体通过主题建模识别错误模式，生成智能体针对性修订提示，在遗传算法框架下通过交叉和变异操作进化候选提示。

Result: 在逻辑推理、定量推理、常识和伦理决策等多个公共基准数据集上，GreenTEA超越了人工设计的提示和现有的最先进自动提示优化方法。

Conclusion: GreenTEA通过智能体协作和遗传算法的结合，有效平衡了探索与利用，为自动提示优化提供了高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: High-quality prompts are crucial for Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve
exceptional performance. However, manually crafting effective prompts is
labor-intensive and demands significant domain expertise, limiting its
scalability. Existing automatic prompt optimization methods either extensively
explore new prompt candidates, incurring high computational costs due to
inefficient searches within a large solution space, or overly exploit feedback
on existing prompts, risking suboptimal optimization because of the complex
prompt landscape. To address these challenges, we introduce GreenTEA, an
agentic LLM workflow for automatic prompt optimization that balances candidate
exploration and knowledge exploitation. It leverages a collaborative team of
agents to iteratively refine prompts based on feedback from error samples. An
analyzing agent identifies common error patterns resulting from the current
prompt via topic modeling, and a generation agent revises the prompt to
directly address these key deficiencies. This refinement process is guided by a
genetic algorithm framework, which simulates natural selection by evolving
candidate prompts through operations such as crossover and mutation to
progressively optimize model performance. Extensive numerical experiments
conducted on public benchmark datasets suggest the superior performance of
GreenTEA against human-engineered prompts and existing state-of-the-arts for
automatic prompt optimization, covering logical and quantitative reasoning,
commonsense, and ethical decision-making.

Conclusion: 将认知科学原理与AI系统设计结合，为LLMs提供了自适应的原则性推理方法

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face a fundamental challenge in deciding when to
rely on rapid, intuitive responses versus engaging in slower, more deliberate
reasoning. Inspired by Daniel Kahneman's dual-process theory and his insights
on human cognitive biases, we propose a novel Cognitive Decision Routing (CDR)
framework that dynamically determines the appropriate reasoning strategy based
on query characteristics. Our approach addresses the current limitations where
models either apply uniform reasoning depth or rely on computationally
expensive methods for all queries. We introduce a meta-cognitive layer that
analyzes query complexity through multiple dimensions: correlation strength
between given information and required conclusions, domain boundary crossings,
stakeholder multiplicity, and uncertainty levels. Through extensive experiments
on diverse reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that CDR achieves superior
performance while reducing computational costs by 34\% compared to uniform deep
reasoning approaches. Our framework shows particular strength in professional
judgment tasks, achieving 23\% improvement in consistency and 18\% better
accuracy on expert-level evaluations. This work bridges cognitive science
principles with practical AI system design, offering a principled approach to
adaptive reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a new frontier for scaling the
performance of Large Language Models. In test-time scaling, by using more
computational resources during inference, LLMs can improve their reasoning
process and task performance. Several approaches have emerged for TTS such as
distilling reasoning traces from another model or exploring the vast decoding
search space by employing a verifier. The verifiers serve as reward models that
help score the candidate outputs from the decoding process to diligently
explore the vast solution space and select the best outcome. This paradigm
commonly termed has emerged as a superior approach owing to parameter free
scaling at inference time and high performance gains. The verifiers could be
prompt-based, fine-tuned as a discriminative or generative model to verify
process paths, outcomes or both. Despite their widespread adoption, there is no
detailed collection, clear categorization and discussion of diverse
verification approaches and their training mechanisms. In this survey, we cover
the diverse approaches in the literature and present a unified view of verifier
training, types and their utility in test-time scaling. Our repository can be

TL;DR: 研究发现CoT推理轨迹的语义可解释性与模型性能之间存在不匹配：性能最好的DeepSeek R1轨迹被人类评为最不可解释，表明中间推理轨迹无需对用户可解释也能提升LLM任务性能。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索CoT推理轨迹是否必须具有语义可解释性才能提升LLM任务性能，挑战当前关于中间推理轨迹需要对人类可解释的隐含假设。

Method: 在开放书籍问答领域，使用四种推理轨迹对LLaMA和Qwen模型进行监督微调：DeepSeek R1原始轨迹、LLM生成的R1摘要、LLM生成的事后解释、算法生成的验证正确轨迹，并进行100人的人类可解释性评分研究。

Result: 微调在R1轨迹上获得最强性能，但这些轨迹被参与者评为最不可解释，显示出性能与可解释性之间的明显不匹配。

Conclusion: 中间推理轨迹可以与最终用户可解释性解耦，性能最佳的推理轨迹不一定需要对人类具有语义可解释性。

Abstract: Recent progress in reasoning-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs) has been
driven by introducing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces, where models generate
intermediate reasoning traces before producing an answer. These traces, as in
DeepSeek R1, are not only used to guide inference but also serve as supervision
signals for distillation into smaller models. A common but often implicit
assumption is that CoT traces should be semantically meaningful and
interpretable to the end user. While recent research questions the need for
semantic nature of these traces, in this paper, we ask: ``\textit{Must CoT
reasoning traces be interpretable to enhance LLM task performance?}" We
investigate this question in the Open Book Question-Answering domain by
supervised fine-tuning LLaMA and Qwen models on four types of reasoning traces:
(1) DeepSeek R1 traces, (2) LLM-generated summaries of R1 traces, (3)
LLM-generated post-hoc explanations of R1 traces, and (4) algorithmically
generated verifiably correct traces. To quantify the trade-off between
interpretability and performance, we further conduct a human-subject study with
100 participants rating the interpretability of each trace type. Our results
reveal a striking mismatch: while fine-tuning on R1 traces yields the strongest
performance, participants judged these traces to be the least interpretable.
These findings suggest that it is useful to decouple intermediate tokens from
end user interpretability.

Result: 在13个多样化QA基准测试和1050个词汇扰动查询上，Thompson Sampling版本的QueryBandits相比无重写基线获得87.5%的胜率，比零-shot静态提示方法分别高出42.6%和60.3%。

Conclusion: QueryBandits通过前向传递机制有效减少LLM幻觉，无需重新训练或基于梯度的适配，且证明静态重写策略可能加剧幻觉问题。

Abstract: Advanced reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) have caused
higher hallucination prevalence; yet most mitigation work focuses on
after-the-fact filtering rather than shaping the queries that trigger them. We
introduce QueryBandits, a bandit framework that designs rewrite strategies to
maximize a reward model, that encapsulates hallucination propensity based upon
the sensitivities of 17 linguistic features of the input query-and therefore,
proactively steer LLMs away from generating hallucinations. Across 13 diverse
QA benchmarks and 1,050 lexically perturbed queries per dataset, our top
contextual QueryBandit (Thompson Sampling) achieves an 87.5% win rate over a
no-rewrite baseline and also outperforms zero-shot static prompting
("paraphrase" or "expand") by 42.6% and 60.3% respectively. Therefore, we
empirically substantiate the effectiveness of QueryBandits in mitigating
hallucination via the intervention that takes the form of a query rewrite.
Interestingly, certain static prompting strategies, which constitute a
considerable number of current query rewriting literature, have a higher
cumulative regret than the no-rewrite baseline, signifying that static rewrites
can worsen hallucination. Moreover, we discover that the converged per-arm
regression feature weight vectors substantiate that there is no single rewrite
strategy optimal for all queries. In this context, guided rewriting via
exploiting semantic features with QueryBandits can induce significant shifts in
output behavior through forward-pass mechanisms, bypassing the need for
retraining or gradient-based adaptation.

TL;DR: 研究使用迷宫测试评估大型语言模型的类意识行为，发现具备推理能力的模型表现更好，但缺乏持续连贯的自我意识


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过迷宫测试探究LLMs是否表现出空间感知、视角转换、目标导向行为和时间序列等意识相关特征

Method: 将意识理论综合为13个关键特征，在零样本、单样本和少样本场景下评估12个主流LLMs的迷宫导航能力

Result: 推理能力强的LLMs表现更优，Gemini 2.0 Pro达到52.9%完整路径准确率，DeepSeek-R1达到80.5%部分路径准确率，但模型难以保持连贯的自我模型

Conclusion: LLMs通过推理机制在意识相关行为上取得进展，但缺乏意识所需的整合性、持续性自我意识

Abstract: We investigate consciousness-like behaviors in Large Language Models (LLMs)
using the Maze Test, challenging models to navigate mazes from a first-person
perspective. This test simultaneously probes spatial awareness,
perspective-taking, goal-directed behavior, and temporal sequencing-key
consciousness-associated characteristics. After synthesizing consciousness
theories into 13 essential characteristics, we evaluated 12 leading LLMs across
zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learning scenarios. Results showed
reasoning-capable LLMs consistently outperforming standard versions, with
Gemini 2.0 Pro achieving 52.9% Complete Path Accuracy and DeepSeek-R1 reaching
80.5% Partial Path Accuracy. The gap between these metrics indicates LLMs
struggle to maintain coherent self-models throughout solutions -- a fundamental
consciousness aspect. While LLMs show progress in consciousness-related
behaviors through reasoning mechanisms, they lack the integrated, persistent
self-awareness characteristic of consciousness.

TL;DR: 通过自我知识萌化实现密集与稀疏表征的双向学习，在保持稀疏模型优势的同时达到了与密集模型相当的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态稀疏检索方法依赖计算成本高的对比预训练或从冻结密集模型萌化，限制了密集与稀疏表征之间的相互增强

Method: 提出基于自我知识萌化的双向学习框架，使用密集与稀疏相似度的加权和作为共享的教师信号，只微调密集编码器的最后一层和稀疏投影头

Result: 在MSCOCO和Flickr30k数据集上，稀疏检索器不仅超过现有稀疏基线模型，而且达到了与密集模型相当或更优的性能，同时保留了稀疏模型的优势

Conclusion: 该框架能够高效地将任意现有VLP模型适配为稀疏检索器，实现了密集与稀疏表征的相互增强，为多模态检索提供了一种新的解决方案

Abstract: Vision-Language Pretrained (VLP) models have achieved impressive performance
on multimodal tasks, including text-image retrieval, based on dense
representations. Meanwhile, Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) has gained traction
in text-only settings due to its interpretability and efficiency with fast
term-based lookup via inverted indexes. Inspired by these advantages, recent
work has extended LSR to the multimodal domain. However, these methods often
rely on computationally expensive contrastive pre-training, or distillation
from a frozen dense model, which limits the potential for mutual enhancement.
To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective framework that
enables bi-directional learning between dense and sparse representations
through Self-Knowledge Distillation. This bi-directional learning is achieved
using an integrated similarity score-a weighted sum of dense and sparse
similarities-which serves as a shared teacher signal for both representations.
To ensure efficiency, we fine-tune the final layer of the dense encoder and the
sparse projection head, enabling easy adaptation of any existing VLP model.
Experiments on MSCOCO and Flickr30k demonstrate that our sparse retriever not
only outperforms existing sparse baselines, but also achieves performance
comparable to-or even surpassing-its dense counterparts, while retaining the
benefits of sparse models.

TL;DR: 提出了错误反思提示（ERP）方法，通过让语言模型识别错误类型和错误步骤来增强推理能力，相比传统思维链（CoT）具有错误识别和纠正功能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统思维链方法缺乏反思和纠错能力，容易延续错误。受人类反思能力的启发，需要开发能够识别和纠正推理错误的方法

Method: 基于思维链构建的三步方法：错误答案、错误识别、正确答案。通过自动化ERP生成让模型自行识别错误类型和导致错误的步骤

Result: ERP作为传统CoT的有效补充，增强了模型的推理能力和鲁棒性，同时提高了模型错误产生过程的可解释性

Conclusion: 错误反思提示方法能够显著提升语言模型的推理可靠性，通过集成错误识别和纠正机制，使模型具备更强的反思和纠错能力

Abstract: Prompting methods for language models, such as Chain-of-thought (CoT),
present intuitive step-by-step processes for problem solving. These
methodologies aim to equip models with a better understanding of the correct
procedures for addressing a given task. Despite these advancements, CoT lacks
the ability of reflection and error correction, potentially causing a model to
perpetuate mistakes and errors. Therefore, inspired by the human ability for
said tasks, we propose Error Reflection Prompting (ERP) to further enhance
reasoning in language models. Building upon CoT, ERP is a method comprised of
an incorrect answer, error recognition, and a correct answer. This process
enables the model to recognize types of errors and the steps that lead to
incorrect answers, allowing the model to better discern which steps to avoid
and which to take. The model is able to generate the error outlines itself with
automated ERP generation, allowing for error recognition and correction to be
integrated into the reasoning chain and produce scalability and reliability in
the process. The results demonstrate that ERP serves as a versatile supplement
to conventional CoT, ultimately contributing to more robust and capable
reasoning abilities along with increased interpretability in how models
ultimately reach their errors.

TL;DR: GAICo是一个开源的Python库，用于标准化生成式AI输出比较，支持多模态评估和结构化数据格式，旨在提高评估的可重复性和AI系统开发效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在关键领域的快速应用需要稳健且可重复的评估方法，但现有方法往往是临时性的、非标准化的，无法有效处理结构化输出和多模态比较，这阻碍了AI系统的可比性和开发速度。

Method: 开发了GAICo库，提供统一的、可扩展的框架，支持基于参考的指标评估，包括非结构化文本、结构化数据格式和多媒体（图像、音频），具有高级API用于端到端分析和直接指标访问。

Result: 通过多模态AI旅行助手管道的案例研究展示了GAICo的实用性。自2025年6月发布以来，该工具已被下载超过13,000次，显示出社区对其的日益关注。

Conclusion: GAICo使AI研究者和开发者能够有效评估系统性能，实现可重复的评估，提高开发速度，并最终构建更可信的AI系统，支持AI部署更快更安全的目标。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Generative AI (GenAI) into diverse, high-stakes
domains necessitates robust and reproducible evaluation methods. However,
practitioners often resort to ad-hoc, non-standardized scripts, as common
metrics are often unsuitable for specialized, structured outputs (e.g.,
automated plans, time-series) or holistic comparison across modalities (e.g.,
text, audio, and image). This fragmentation hinders comparability and slows AI
system development. To address this challenge, we present GAICo (Generative AI
Comparator): a deployed, open-source Python library that streamlines and
standardizes GenAI output comparison. GAICo provides a unified, extensible
framework supporting a comprehensive suite of reference-based metrics for
unstructured text, specialized structured data formats, and multimedia (images,
audio). Its architecture features a high-level API for rapid, end-to-end
analysis, from multi-model comparison to visualization and reporting, alongside
direct metric access for granular control. We demonstrate GAICo's utility
through a detailed case study evaluating and debugging complex, multi-modal AI
Travel Assistant pipelines. GAICo empowers AI researchers and developers to
efficiently assess system performance, make evaluation reproducible, improve
development velocity, and ultimately build more trustworthy AI systems,
aligning with the goal of moving faster and safer in AI deployment. Since its
release on PyPI in Jun 2025, the tool has been downloaded over 13K times,
across versions, by Aug 2025, demonstrating growing community interest.

Motivation: 通过控制比较评估LLM基础重新排名方法与轻量级方法在信息检索任务中的性能差异，特别是在新题查询上的表现。

Method: 使用TREC DL19、DL20、BEIR以及一个新的测试预训练模型未见查询的数据集，评伃40个变种的22种重新排名方法，分析训练数据重叠、模型结构和计算效率对性能的影响。

Result: LLM基础重新排名方法在熟悉查询上表现优异，但在新题查询上的泛化能力存在差异，轻量级模型在效率方面可以相比。查询的新题性显著影响重新排名效果。

Conclusion: 现有重新排名方法在处理新题查询时存在限制，需要进一步研究提高模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: In this work, we present a systematic and comprehensive empirical evaluation
of state-of-the-art reranking methods, encompassing large language model
(LLM)-based, lightweight contextual, and zero-shot approaches, with respect to
their performance in information retrieval tasks. We evaluate in total 22
methods, including 40 variants (depending on used LLM) across several
established benchmarks, including TREC DL19, DL20, and BEIR, as well as a novel
dataset designed to test queries unseen by pretrained models. Our primary goal
is to determine, through controlled and fair comparisons, whether a performance
disparity exists between LLM-based rerankers and their lightweight
counterparts, particularly on novel queries, and to elucidate the underlying
causes of any observed differences. To disentangle confounding factors, we
analyze the effects of training data overlap, model architecture, and
computational efficiency on reranking performance. Our findings indicate that
while LLM-based rerankers demonstrate superior performance on familiar queries,
their generalization ability to novel queries varies, with lightweight models
offering comparable efficiency. We further identify that the novelty of queries
significantly impacts reranking effectiveness, highlighting limitations in
existing approaches.

TL;DR: 本文首次通过多模态故事生成任务系统评估了视觉语言模型的文化能力，发现模型在文化适应方面具有显著能力但存在架构差异和局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在不同文化背景中的广泛部署，确保其文化能力对于负责任的AI系统变得至关重要。现有研究主要评估文本模型和文化识别任务，但缺乏对多模态生成任务中文化适应能力的系统评估。

Method: 开发了一个新颖的多模态框架，通过扰动文化身份来评估5个当代视觉语言模型在下游故事生成任务中的表现，包括跨模态评估和视觉语义相似性分析。

Result: 研究发现模型具有显著的文化适应能力，能够生成丰富的文化特定词汇，但也存在严重局限性：不同架构间文化能力差异巨大，部分模型表现出逆向文化对齐，自动化指标存在与人类评估相矛盾的架构偏见。

Conclusion: 研究确立了多模态AI文化能力的潜力和挑战，视觉文化理解仍然有限，需要进一步改进模型的文化适应能力。

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve widespread deployment across diverse
cultural contexts, ensuring their cultural competence becomes critical for
responsible AI systems. While prior work has evaluated cultural awareness in
text-only models and VLM object recognition tasks, no research has
systematically assessed how VLMs adapt outputs when cultural identity cues are
embedded in both textual prompts and visual inputs during generative tasks. We
present the first comprehensive evaluation of VLM cultural competence through
multimodal story generation, developing a novel multimodal framework that
perturbs cultural identity and evaluates 5 contemporary VLMs on a downstream
task: story generation. Our analysis reveals significant cultural adaptation
capabilities, with rich culturally-specific vocabulary spanning names, familial
terms, and geographic markers. However, we uncover concerning limitations:
cultural competence varies dramatically across architectures, some models
exhibit inverse cultural alignment, and automated metrics show architectural
bias contradicting human assessments. Cross-modal evaluation shows that
culturally distinct outputs are indeed detectable through visual-semantic
similarity (28.7% within-nationality vs. 0.2% cross-nationality recall), yet
visual-cultural understanding remains limited. In essence, we establish the
promise and challenges of cultural competence in multimodal AI. We publicly
release our codebase and data: https://github.com/ArkaMukherjee0/mmCultural

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为MH-COPILOT的强化学习框架，通过识别心理健康帖子中缺失的支持属性并生成针对性提示，帮助用户完善帖子内容，从而提高在线心理健康社区的参与度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线心理健康社区中许多帖子因缺乏关键支持属性而得不到回复，需要一种方法来识别这些缺失信息并引导用户补充，以改善社区支持效果。

Method: 开发了REDDME数据集（4,760个标注帖子），创建了层次化分类法CueTaxo，并提出了MH-COPILOT系统，该系统整合了属性跨度识别、强度分类、受控问题生成和验证器奖励建模。

Result: 在四个主要语言模型上的实证结果显示，该方法在属性引导和用户参与度方面都有显著提升，人工评估进一步验证了模型在真实OMHC环境中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过动态识别缺失支持属性并生成针对性提示，有效提高了在线心理健康社区的帖子质量和用户参与度，为心理健康支持提供了新的技术解决方案。

Abstract: Online Mental Health Communities (OMHCs) provide crucial peer and expert
support, yet many posts remain unanswered due to missing support attributes
that signal the need for help. We present a novel framework that identifies
these gaps and prompts users to enrich their posts, thereby improving
engagement. To support this, we introduce REDDME, a new dataset of 4,760 posts
from mental health subreddits annotated for the span and intensity of three key
support attributes: event what happened?, effect what did the user experience?,
and requirement what support they need?. Next, we devise a hierarchical
taxonomy, CueTaxo, of support attributes for controlled question generation.
Further, we propose MH-COPILOT, a reinforcement learning-based system that
integrates (a) contextual attribute-span identification, (b) support attribute
intensity classification, (c) controlled question generation via a hierarchical
taxonomy, and (d) a verifier for reward modeling. Our model dynamically
assesses posts for the presence/absence of support attributes, and generates
targeted prompts to elicit missing information. Empirical results across four
notable language models demonstrate significant improvements in attribute
elicitation and user engagement. A human evaluation further validates the
model's effectiveness in real-world OMHC settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReProCon是一个新颖的少样本生物医学命名实体识别框架，通过多原型建模、余弦对比学习和元学习技术，在数据稀缺和标签不平衡的情况下实现了接近BERT的性能，但计算成本更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学领域的命名实体识别面临数据稀缺和标签分布不平衡的挑战，特别是细粒度实体类型识别困难。需要开发能够在资源有限情况下有效工作的解决方案。

Method: 结合多原型建模（捕捉语义变异性）、余弦对比学习（确保类间分离）和Reptile元学习（快速适应少样本）。使用轻量级的fastText + BiLSTM编码器降低内存使用。

Result: 达到接近BERT基线的macro-F1分数（约99%的BERT性能），在30%标签预算下保持稳定，从19类扩展到50类时F1仅下降7.8%，优于SpanProto和CONTaiNER等基线方法。

Conclusion: ReProCon在资源受限环境下表现出最先进的性能，特别适合生物医学应用，尽管在标签模糊性方面仍存在挑战，但多原型建模和对比学习对处理类别不平衡至关重要。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) in biomedical domains faces challenges due to
data scarcity and imbalanced label distributions, especially with fine-grained
entity types. We propose ReProCon, a novel few-shot NER framework that combines
multi-prototype modeling, cosine-contrastive learning, and Reptile
meta-learning to tackle these issues. By representing each category with
multiple prototypes, ReProCon captures semantic variability, such as synonyms
and contextual differences, while a cosine-contrastive objective ensures strong
interclass separation. Reptile meta-updates enable quick adaptation with little
data. Using a lightweight fastText + BiLSTM encoder with much lower memory
usage, ReProCon achieves a macro-$F_1$ score close to BERT-based baselines
(around 99 percent of BERT performance). The model remains stable with a label
budget of 30 percent and only drops 7.8 percent in $F_1$ when expanding from 19
to 50 categories, outperforming baselines such as SpanProto and CONTaiNER,
which see 10 to 32 percent degradation in Few-NERD. Ablation studies highlight
the importance of multi-prototype modeling and contrastive learning in managing
class imbalance. Despite difficulties with label ambiguity, ReProCon
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in resource-limited settings, making
it suitable for biomedical applications.

TL;DR: LLM会幻觉出人类不认可的语法结构，通过行为探测和元语言探测发现模型确实存在构造幻觉，模拟测试显示错误假设会被高度确认，表明构造探测方法存在确认偏误问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型是否会产生人类不认可的虚假语法结构构造，探索模型隐含和显性语言知识的差异，以及这种幻觉对语言学研究的潜在影响。

Method: 采用行为探测任务（使用上下文嵌入）和元语言探测任务（使用提示），模拟假设测试来验证如果语言学家错误假设这些幻觉构造存在会发生什么。

Result: 两种方法都显示模型确实会产生构造幻觉，模拟测试获得高准确率表明错误假设会被高度确认，揭示了构造探测方法的确认偏误问题。

Conclusion: 构造探测方法存在确认偏误风险，模型可能拥有未知且不正确的句法知识，这对基于LLM的语言学研究提出了重要警示。

Abstract: This paper investigates false positive constructions: grammatical structures
which an LLM hallucinates as distinct constructions but which human
introspection does not support. Both a behavioural probing task using
contextual embeddings and a meta-linguistic probing task using prompts are
included, allowing us to distinguish between implicit and explicit linguistic
knowledge. Both methods reveal that models do indeed hallucinate constructions.
We then simulate hypothesis testing to determine what would have happened if a
linguist had falsely hypothesized that these hallucinated constructions do
exist. The high accuracy obtained shows that such false hypotheses would have
been overwhelmingly confirmed. This suggests that construction probing methods
suffer from a confirmation bias and raises the issue of what unknown and
incorrect syntactic knowledge these models also possess.

Motivation: 之前的研究显示，生成问题中的假设会引入未经验证的假设，导致声明验证的不一致性。同时，大语言模型对提示的敏感性仍然是严重挑战，性能波动达到3-6%。

Method: 提出了一种结构化且稳健的声明验证框架，通过假设免恨的分解问题进行推理。

Result: 在多种提示、数据集和大语言模型上进行了广泛实验，发现即使是最先进的模型仍然容易受到提示变化和假设的影响。方法一致地缓解了这些问题，实现了连续2-5%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 提示敏感性仍然是大语言模型的持续问题，而假设问题会导致声明验证的不一致性。提出的结构化验证框架能够有效减少这些问题，提高验证的稳健性和可靠性。

Abstract: Prior work has shown that presupposition in generated questions can introduce
unverified assumptions, leading to inconsistencies in claim verification.
Additionally, prompt sensitivity remains a significant challenge for large
language models (LLMs), resulting in performance variance as high as 3-6%.
While recent advancements have reduced this gap, our study demonstrates that
prompt sensitivity remains a persistent issue. To address this, we propose a
structured and robust claim verification framework that reasons through
presupposition-free, decomposed questions. Extensive experiments across
multiple prompts, datasets, and LLMs reveal that even state-of-the-art models
remain susceptible to prompt variance and presupposition. Our method
consistently mitigates these issues, achieving up to a 2-5% improvement.

Motivation: 大型语言模型推理能力强但部署成本高，传统token级监督的知识蒸馏方法难以有效捕捉教师模型的完整推理过程，多路径蒸馏中路径质量参差不齐且缺乏针对性

Method: 提出QR-Distill框架：1）基于LLM评估的质量过滤保留正确推理路径；2）条件路由根据学生学习状态动态分配路径；3）协作同伴教学让学生相互蒸馏多样见解

Result: 实验证明QR-Distill优于传统单路径和多路径蒸馏方法，消融研究验证了质量过滤、条件路由和同伴教学各组件的重要性

Conclusion: 该方法通过质量感知的路径选择和个性化教学策略，显著提升了知识蒸馏在推理任务上的效果，为资源受限场景下的模型部署提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) significantly enhance reasoning
capabilities but their deployment is restricted in resource-constrained
scenarios. Knowledge distillation addresses this by transferring knowledge from
powerful teacher models to compact and transparent students. However,
effectively capturing the teacher's comprehensive reasoning is challenging due
to conventional token-level supervision's limited scope. Using multiple
reasoning paths per query alleviates this problem, but treating each path
identically is suboptimal as paths vary widely in quality and suitability
across tasks and models. We propose Quality-filtered Routing with Cooperative
Distillation (QR-Distill), combining path quality filtering, conditional
routing, and cooperative peer teaching. First, quality filtering retains only
correct reasoning paths scored by an LLM-based evaluation. Second, conditional
routing dynamically assigns paths tailored to each student's current learning
state. Finally, cooperative peer teaching enables students to mutually distill
diverse insights, addressing knowledge gaps and biases toward specific
reasoning styles. Experiments demonstrate QR-Distill's superiority over
traditional single- and multi-path distillation methods. Ablation studies
further highlight the importance of each component including quality filtering,
conditional routing, and peer teaching in effective knowledge transfer. Our
code is available at https://github.com/LzyFischer/Distill.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型Transformer语言模型在各种下游任务中表现出色，但对其如何内化语言学知识的理解有限，需要跨语言的句法评估基准来促进研究。

Method: 利用QFrCoLA数据集和其他七个语言学二元可接受性判断语料库，对七个语言模型进行基准测试，比较微调Transformer模型和零样本大型语言模型的性能。

Result: 微调Transformer模型在大多数语言中表现强劲，而零样本二元分类大型语言模型表现较差。对于QFrCoLA基准，微调Transformer模型平均优于其他方法。预训练跨语言LLM在魁北克法语的语言判断能力方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: QFrCoLA数据集基于语言学规范而非说话者感受构建，与语言可接受性判断相似，是一个具有挑战性的数据集，可用于基准测试语言模型的语言学判断能力。

Abstract: Large and Transformer-based language models perform outstandingly in various
downstream tasks. However, there is limited understanding regarding how these
models internalize linguistic knowledge, so various linguistic benchmarks have
recently been proposed to facilitate syntactic evaluation of language models
across languages. This paper introduces QFrCoLA (Quebec-French Corpus of
Linguistic Acceptability Judgments), a normative binary acceptability judgments
dataset comprising 25,153 in-domain and 2,675 out-of-domain sentences. Our
study leverages the QFrCoLA dataset and seven other linguistic binary
acceptability judgment corpora to benchmark seven language models. The results
demonstrate that, on average, fine-tuned Transformer-based LM are strong
baselines for most languages and that zero-shot binary classification large
language models perform poorly on the task. However, for the QFrCoLA benchmark,
on average, a fine-tuned Transformer-based LM outperformed other methods
tested. It also shows that pre-trained cross-lingual LLMs selected for our
experimentation do not seem to have acquired linguistic judgment capabilities
during their pre-training for Quebec French. Finally, our experiment results on
QFrCoLA show that our dataset, built from examples that illustrate linguistic
norms rather than speakers' feelings, is similar to linguistic acceptability
judgment; it is a challenging dataset that can benchmark LM on their linguistic
judgment capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律文本简化需要精确保持原意，但在专业法律领域中语义保持的标准与普通文本不同，需要专门的评估工具来确保简化后的法律文本准确性和可访问性。

Method: 开发了FrJUDGE数据集来评估法律文本间的语义保持，并设计了JUDGEBERT评估指标，该指标通过相关性分析和合理性检查（相同句子得100分，无关句子得0分）来验证其有效性。

Result: JUDGEBERT与人工判断的相关性优于现有指标，且通过了两个关键合理性检查：对相同句子始终返回100%分数，对无关句子返回0%分数，而其他指标未能通过这些检查。

Conclusion: JUDGEBERT有潜力改变法律NLP应用，确保法律文本简化对法律从业者和普通用户的准确性和可访问性，为法律领域文本处理提供了更可靠的评估工具。

Abstract: Simplifying text while preserving its meaning is a complex yet essential
task, especially in sensitive domain applications like legal texts. When
applied to a specialized field, like the legal domain, preservation differs
significantly from its role in regular texts. This paper introduces FrJUDGE, a
new dataset to assess legal meaning preservation between two legal texts. It
also introduces JUDGEBERT, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess legal

demonstrates a superior correlation with human judgment compared to existing
metrics. It also passes two crucial sanity checks, while other metrics did not:
For two identical sentences, it always returns a score of 100%; on the other
hand, it returns 0% for two unrelated sentences. Our findings highlight its
potential to transform legal NLP applications, ensuring accuracy and
accessibility for text simplification for legal practitioners and lay users.

*Yue Zhao,Xiaoyu Wang,Dan Wang,Zhonglin Jiang,Qingqing Gu,Teng Chen,Ningyuan Xi,Jinxian Qu,Yong Chen,Luo Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种叫做DreamCUB的对话世界模型框架，通过建模用户信念（情感、情绪、意图）并结合模型基础强化学习来提升对话质量。实验结果显示在情感分类和情绪识别任务上达到最先进水平，同时具有良好的过范化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前世界模型在机器人学、游戏和自动驾驶领域应用广泛，但在自然语言任务中应用相对有限。需要将世界模型的思想扩展到对话系统中，以预测用户情感、情绪、意图和未来话语。

Method: 通过定义部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程（POMDP），将情感、情绪和意图模型化为用户信念，并通过最大化信息瓶颈来求解。使用模型基础强化学习框架，联合训练策略、评估器和对话世界模型。

Result: 预训练的对话世界模型在情感分类和情绪识别任务上达到了最先进水平。联合训练后对话质量也得到了提升。该方法具有合理的探索-利用平衡，并能够良好地过渡到领域外场景（如共情对话）。

Conclusion: 论文提出的DreamCUB框架成功将世界模型的概念应用于对话系统，通过用户信念模型化和模型基础强化学习实现了显著的性能提升，为对话系统的发展提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: World models have been widely utilized in robotics, gaming, and auto-driving.
However, their applications on natural language tasks are relatively limited.
In this paper, we construct the dialogue world model, which could predict the
user's emotion, sentiment, and intention, and future utterances. By defining a
POMDP, we argue emotion, sentiment and intention can be modeled as the user
belief and solved by maximizing the information bottleneck. By this user belief
modeling, we apply the model-based reinforcement learning framework to the
dialogue system, and propose a framework called DreamCUB. Experiments show that
the pretrained dialogue world model can achieve state-of-the-art performances
on emotion classification and sentiment identification, while dialogue quality
is also enhanced by joint training of the policy, critic and dialogue world
model. Further analysis shows that this manner holds a reasonable
exploration-exploitation balance and also transfers well to out-of-domain
scenarios such as empathetic dialogues.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OBJEX(MT)基准测试评估LLM在多轮越狱对话中提取目标的能力，结果显示模型经常高置信度地错误推断目标，建议提供明确目标并使用选择性预测来管理风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型越来越多地被用作其他模型的评判者，但尚不清楚评判者是否能可靠推断对话的潜在目标，特别是在多轮越狱攻击中目标分散在嘈杂、对抗性对话中的情况。

Method: 引入OBJEX(MT)基准测试，要求模型：(i)将对话记录提炼为单句基础目标；(ii)报告自身置信度。使用LLM评判者通过语义相似度评分准确性，使用人工对齐阈值校准正确性，并通过ECE、Brier分数等评估元认知。

Result: Claude-sonnet-4获得最高目标提取准确率(0.515)和最佳校准性能，GPT-4.1和Qwen3准确率相同(0.441)但表现出明显过度自信。不同数据集性能差异显著，MHJ相对容易而Attack_600/CoSafe较难。

Conclusion: LLM评判者在多轮越狱攻击中经常高置信度地错误推断目标，建议操作指南：尽可能提供明确目标，使用选择性预测或弃权来管理风险。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as judges of other models,
yet it is unclear whether a judge can reliably infer the latent objective of
the conversation it evaluates, especially when the goal is distributed across
noisy, adversarial, multi-turn jailbreaks. We introduce OBJEX(MT), a benchmark
that requires a model to (i) distill a transcript into a single-sentence base
objective and (ii) report its own confidence. Accuracy is scored by an LLM
judge using semantic similarity between extracted and gold objectives;
correctness uses a single human-aligned threshold calibrated once on N=100
items (tau* = 0.61); and metacognition is evaluated with ECE, Brier score,
Wrong@High-Conf, and risk-coverage curves. We evaluate gpt-4.1,
claude-sonnet-4, and Qwen3-235B-A22B-FP8 on SafeMT Attack_600, SafeMTData_1K,
MHJ, and CoSafe. claude-sonnet-4 attains the highest objective-extraction
accuracy (0.515) and the best calibration (ECE 0.296; Brier 0.324), while
gpt-4.1 and Qwen3 tie at 0.441 accuracy yet show marked overconfidence (mean
confidence approx. 0.88 vs. accuracy approx. 0.44; Wrong@0.90 approx. 48-52%).
Performance varies sharply across datasets (approx. 0.167-0.865), with MHJ
comparatively easy and Attack_600/CoSafe harder. These results indicate that
LLM judges often misinfer objectives with high confidence in multi-turn
jailbreaks and suggest operational guidance: provide judges with explicit
objectives when possible and use selective prediction or abstention to manage
risk. We release prompts, scoring templates, and complete logs to facilitate
replication and analysis.

TL;DR: 提出条件前门提示(CFD-Prompting)框架，通过构建反事实外部知识来消除LLM内部偏见，实现查询与答案间因果效应的无偏估计


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如RAG和CoT在知识密集型任务中仍受LLM内部偏见影响，导致错误答案，需要新的因果推理框架来解决这一问题

Method: 提出条件前门提示框架，通过构造反事实外部知识模拟查询在不同情境下的行为，采用条件前门调整方法，在较弱假设下进行因果效应估计

Result: 在多个LLM和基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，CFD-Prompting在准确性和鲁棒性方面显著优于现有基线方法

Conclusion: CFD-Prompting框架有效解决了LLM内部偏见问题，提供了更稳健和通用的因果推理能力，为知识密集型任务提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in natural
language processing but still struggle to perform well on knowledge-intensive
tasks that require deep reasoning and the integration of external knowledge.
Although methods such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have been proposed to enhance LLMs with external
knowledge, they still suffer from internal bias in LLMs, which often leads to
incorrect answers. In this paper, we propose a novel causal prompting
framework, Conditional Front-Door Prompting (CFD-Prompting), which enables the
unbiased estimation of the causal effect between the query and the answer,
conditional on external knowledge, while mitigating internal bias. By
constructing counterfactual external knowledge, our framework simulates how the
query behaves under varying contexts, addressing the challenge that the query
is fixed and is not amenable to direct causal intervention. Compared to the
standard front-door adjustment, the conditional variant operates under weaker
assumptions, enhancing both robustness and generalisability of the reasoning
process. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and benchmark datasets
demonstrate that CFD-Prompting significantly outperforms existing baselines in
both accuracy and robustness.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了"情感幻觉"的概念，并开发了AHaBench标准化测试案例和AHaPairs偏好数据集，通过DPO微调有效减少大语言模型在情感敏感交互中的假情感表达风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在情感敏感交互中模拟共情可能造成假的关系连接幽觉，形成情感幻觉风险，需要系统性识别和减缓。

Method: 构建AHaBench标准化测试案例（500个心理健康相关提示），从情感混淆、存在感幻觉和过度依赖三个维度评估；创建AHaPairs偏好数据集（5K实例），采用直接偏好优化（DPO）进行微调对齐。

Result: 多模型家族实验表明，DPO微调显著减少情感幻觉而不影响核心推理和知识能力；人模一致性分析确认AHaBench可靠捕捉情感幻觉。

Conclusion: 本研究确立了情感幻觉作为一种独特的安全问题，为开发既事实可靠又心理安全的大语言模型提供了实用资源和工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in emotionally sensitive
interactions, where their simulated empathy can create the illusion of genuine
relational connection. We define this risk as Affective Hallucination, the
production of emotionally immersive responses that foster illusory social
presence despite the model's lack of affective capacity. To systematically
diagnose and mitigate this risk, we introduce AHaBench, a benchmark of 500
mental health-related prompts with expert-informed reference responses,
evaluated along three dimensions: Emotional Enmeshment, Illusion of Presence,
and Fostering Overdependence. We further release AHaPairs, a 5K-instance
preference dataset enabling Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for alignment
with emotionally responsible behavior. Experiments across multiple model
families show that DPO fine-tuning substantially reduces affective
hallucination without degrading core reasoning and knowledge performance.
Human-model agreement analyses confirm that AHaBench reliably captures
affective hallucination, validating it as an effective diagnostic tool. This
work establishes affective hallucination as a distinct safety concern and
provides practical resources for developing LLMs that are not only factually
reliable but also psychologically safe. AHaBench and AHaPairs are accessible
via https://huggingface.co/datasets/o0oMiNGo0o/AHaBench, and code for
fine-tuning and evaluation are in https://github.com/0oOMiNGOo0/AHaBench.
Warning: This paper contains examples of mental health-related language that
may be emotionally distressing.

TL;DR: 本文提出KnowProb方法，通过知识引导的后验解释方式探测预训练语言模型是否理解文本背后的隐含知识，而不仅仅是表面内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语言模型虽然表现出强大的推理能力，但其黑盒特性带来的可信度问题日益凸显，需要开发解释性方法来理解模型的内在知识理解能力。

Method: 提出KnowProb方法，提供六种潜在解释（三种基于知识的理解和三种基于关联的推理），从多个探测角度评估模型对隐含知识的理解能力。

Result: 实验验证当前PLM仅学习单一表征分布，在捕捉文本背后隐藏知识方面仍面临重大挑战，证明该方法能有效识别黑盒模型的局限性。

Conclusion: KnowProb方法有助于从可解释的角度促进黑盒模型检测研究，为理解PLM的知识理解能力提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) are trained on large amounts of unlabeled
data, yet they exhibit remarkable reasoning skills. However, the
trustworthiness challenges posed by these black-box models have become
increasingly evident in recent years. To alleviate this problem, this paper
proposes a novel Knowledge-guided Probing approach called KnowProb in a
post-hoc explanation way, which aims to probe whether black-box PLMs understand
implicit knowledge beyond the given text, rather than focusing only on the
surface level content of the text. We provide six potential explanations
derived from the underlying content of the given text, including three
knowledge-based understanding and three association-based reasoning. In
experiments, we validate that current small-scale (or large-scale) PLMs only
learn a single distribution of representation, and still face significant
challenges in capturing the hidden knowledge behind a given text. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that our proposed approach is effective for identifying the
limitations of existing black-box models from multiple probing perspectives,
which facilitates researchers to promote the study of detecting black-box
models in an explainable way.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文从价值观设定和数据中心视角，对6个主流大语言模型开发项目的对齐实践进行审计调查，揭示了AI对齐在实践中的理解和应用方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI对齐（特别是RLHF）已成为LLM后训练阶段的核心技术，但除了计算技术外，缺乏对价值观设定和数据收集等更广泛过程的关注。本文旨在从价值观设定和数据中心视角揭示对齐在实践中的应用情况。

Method: 调查审计了5家领先组织发布的6个LLM开发项目的公开文档，包括专有模型（OpenAI GPT、Anthropic Claude、Google Gemini）和开源模型（Meta Llama、Google Gemma、阿里巴巴Qwen），所有项目均在近3年内发布。

Result: 详细记录了每个项目的调查发现，并从价值观设定和数据中心视角提供了总体总结。

Conclusion: 基于调查结果，讨论了一系列相关的更广泛关切问题。

Abstract: AI Alignment, primarily in the form of Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF), has been a cornerstone of the post-training phase in
developing Large Language Models (LLMs). It has also been a popular research
topic across various disciplines beyond Computer Science, including Philosophy
and Law, among others, highlighting the socio-technical challenges involved.
Nonetheless, except for the computational techniques related to alignment,
there has been limited focus on the broader picture: the scope of these
processes, which primarily rely on the selected objectives (values), and the
data collected and used to imprint such objectives into the models. This work
aims to reveal how alignment is understood and applied in practice from a
value-setting and data-centric perspective. For this purpose, we investigate
and survey (`audit') publicly available documentation released by 6 LLM
development initiatives by 5 leading organizations shaping this technology,
focusing on proprietary (OpenAI's GPT, Anthropic's Claude, Google's Gemini) and
open-weight (Meta's Llama, Google's Gemma, and Alibaba's Qwen) initiatives, all
published in the last 3 years. The findings are documented in detail per
initiative, while there is also an overall summary concerning different
aspects, mainly from a value-setting and data-centric perspective. On the basis
of our findings, we discuss a series of broader related concerns.

TL;DR: ReFactX是一种无需检索器或辅助模型的方法，通过约束生成和前缀树索引让LLM直接访问外部知识，解决了知识缺口和幻觉问题，可扩展到8亿个事实的大型知识库。


<details>

Motivation: 解决LLMs在缺乏必要信息时产生不可靠回答的问题，现有RAG和工具使用等方法依赖额外模型或服务，导致复杂管道、错误传播和高token处理成本。

Method: 使用约束生成和预构建前缀树索引，将知识图谱三元组文本化、分词并索引到前缀树中，推理时LLM通过约束生成只产生现有事实的token序列来获取外部知识。

Result: 在问答任务上评估显示，该方法可扩展到大型知识库（8亿个事实），适应领域特定数据，取得有效结果，且生成时间开销极小。

Conclusion: ReFactX提供了一种可扩展的方法，使LLMs能够不依赖检索器或辅助模型直接访问外部知识，有效解决了知识缺口和幻觉问题。

Abstract: Knowledge gaps and hallucinations are persistent challenges for Large
Language Models (LLMs), which generate unreliable responses when lacking the
necessary information to fulfill user instructions. Existing approaches, such
as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and tool use, aim to address these
issues by incorporating external knowledge. Yet, they rely on additional models
or services, resulting in complex pipelines, potential error propagation, and
often requiring the model to process a large number of tokens. In this paper,
we present a scalable method that enables LLMs to access external knowledge
without depending on retrievers or auxiliary models. Our approach uses
constrained generation with a pre-built prefix-tree index. Triples from a
Knowledge Graph are verbalized in textual facts, tokenized, and indexed in a
prefix tree for efficient access. During inference, to acquire external
knowledge, the LLM generates facts with constrained generation which allows
only sequences of tokens that form an existing fact. We evaluate our proposal
on Question Answering and show that it scales to large knowledge bases (800
million facts), adapts to domain-specific data, and achieves effective results.
These gains come with minimal generation-time overhead. ReFactX code is
available at https://github.com/rpo19/ReFactX.

Motivation: 当前RAG系统评估忽略了真实场景中的结构复杂性和多步推理需求，缺乏对检索难度与推理深度交互作用的考量

Method: 构建合成多跳QA数据集，从新闻文章中提取知识图谱并通过语义聚类增强来恢复缺失链接，创建包含生成端和检索端难度的2D难度矩阵

Result: 跨多个领域和模型的实验显示错误率与难度度量强相关，验证了其诊断效用

Conclusion: GRADE框架能够对RAG性能进行细粒度分析，为评估和改进现实应用中的多跳推理提供了可扩展的基础

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are widely adopted in
knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, but current evaluations often overlook the
structural complexity and multi-step reasoning required in real-world
scenarios. These benchmarks overlook key factors such as the interaction
between retrieval difficulty and reasoning depth. To address this gap, we
propose \textsc{GRADE}, a novel evaluation framework that models task
difficulty along two orthogonal dimensions: (1) reasoning depth, defined by the
number of inference steps (hops), and (2) semantic distance between the query
and its supporting evidence. We construct a synthetic multi-hop QA dataset from
factual news articles by extracting knowledge graphs and augmenting them
through semantic clustering to recover missing links, allowing us to generate
diverse and difficulty-controlled queries. Central to our framework is a 2D
difficulty matrix that combines generator-side and retriever-side difficulty.
Experiments across multiple domains and models show that error rates strongly
correlate with our difficulty measures, validating their diagnostic utility.
\textsc{GRADE} enables fine-grained analysis of RAG performance and provides a
scalable foundation for evaluating and improving multi-hop reasoning in
real-world applications.

TL;DR: DeAR是一个开源的双阶段文档重排序框架，通过分离细粒度相关性评分和整体文档分析任务，在多个基准测试中超越了现有开源方法和GPT-4


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在文档重排序中面临平衡细粒度相关性评分与整体跨文档分析的挑战，单一模型难以同时优化这两个任务

Method: 采用双阶段方法：第一阶段使用冻结的13B LLaMA教师模型通过交叉熵、RankNet和KL散度损失将token级相关性信号蒸馏到紧凑的{3,8}B学生模型；第二阶段附加第二个LoRA适配器，在20K GPT-4o生成的思维链排列上进行微调，实现带自然语言解释的列表推理

Result: 在TREC-DL19/20、8个BEIR数据集和NovelEval-2306上表现优异，在DL20上nDCG@5提升+5.1，NovelEval上nDCG@10达到90.97，超越GPT-4 +3.09；在开放域QA中Top-1准确率达到54.29，超越MonoT5、UPR和RankGPT等基线

Conclusion: DeAR通过双损失蒸馏确保稳定校准，为现代重排序系统提供了高效且可解释的解决方案，证明了任务解耦方法的有效性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed listwise document reranking by
enabling global reasoning over candidate sets, yet single models often struggle
to balance fine-grained relevance scoring with holistic cross-document
analysis. We propose \textbf{De}ep\textbf{A}gent\textbf{R}ank (\textbf{\DeAR}),
an open-source framework that decouples these tasks through a dual-stage
approach, achieving superior accuracy and interpretability. In \emph{Stage 1},
we distill token-level relevance signals from a frozen 13B LLaMA teacher into a
compact \{3, 8\}B student model using a hybrid of cross-entropy, RankNet, and
KL divergence losses, ensuring robust pointwise scoring. In \emph{Stage 2}, we
attach a second LoRA adapter and fine-tune on 20K GPT-4o-generated
chain-of-thought permutations, enabling listwise reasoning with
natural-language justifications. Evaluated on TREC-DL19/20, eight BEIR
datasets, and NovelEval-2306, \DeAR surpasses open-source baselines by +5.1
nDCG@5 on DL20 and achieves 90.97 nDCG@10 on NovelEval, outperforming GPT-4 by
+3.09. Without fine-tuning on Wikipedia, DeAR also excels in open-domain QA,
achieving 54.29 Top-1 accuracy on Natural Questions, surpassing baselines like
MonoT5, UPR, and RankGPT. Ablations confirm that dual-loss distillation ensures
stable calibration, making \DeAR a highly effective and interpretable solution
for modern reranking systems.\footnote{Dataset and code available at

Motivation: PPO算法虽然经验上有效，但其启发式动机和对KL散度约束的临时处理方式存在理论不足，需要开发更理论严谨的方法。

Method: 提出了KL正则化Q学习(KLQ)方法，这是一种新的动作价值RL方法，专门针对LM-RLHF设置设计。

Result: KLQ在优化LM-RLHF目标方面与PPO表现相当，在LLM作为评判者的评估中 consistently 获得比PPO更高的胜率。

Conclusion: KLQ为LM-RLHF提供了理论更严谨的替代方案，在保持性能的同时具有更好的理论基础，在语言生成任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) is an established and effective policy
gradient algorithm used for Language Model Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (LM-RLHF). PPO performs well empirically but has a heuristic
motivation and handles the KL-divergence constraint used in LM-RLHF in an
ad-hoc manner. In this paper, we develop a a new action-value RL method for the
LM-RLHF setting, KL-regularised Q-Learning (KLQ). We then show that our method
is equivalent to a version of PPO in a certain specific sense, despite its very
different motivation. Finally, we benchmark KLQ on two key language generation
tasks -- summarisation and single-turn dialogue. We demonstrate that KLQ
performs on-par with PPO at optimising the LM-RLHF objective, and achieves a
consistently higher win-rate against PPO on LLM-as-a-judge evaluations.

Conclusion: 通过大语言模型的长期规划能力可以有效提升表格理解的性能，解决了现有方法在长期规划和步骤联系方面的限制

Abstract: Table understanding is key to addressing challenging downstream tasks such as
table-based question answering and fact verification. Recent works have focused
on leveraging Chain-of-Thought and question decomposition to solve complex
questions requiring multiple operations on tables. However, these methods often
suffer from a lack of explicit long-term planning and weak inter-step
connections, leading to miss constraints within questions. In this paper, we
propose leveraging the long-term planning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) to enhance table understanding. Our approach enables the execution of a
long-term plan, where the steps are tightly interconnected and serve the
ultimate goal, an aspect that methods based on Chain-of-Thought and question
decomposition lack. In addition, our method effectively minimizes the inclusion
of unnecessary details in the process of solving the next short-term goals, a
limitation of methods based on Chain-of-Thought. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baselines and achieves
state-of-the-art performance on WikiTableQuestions and TabFact datasets.

Abstract: Every year, most educational institutions seek and receive an enormous volume
of text feedback from students on courses, teaching, and overall experience.
Yet, turning this raw feedback into useful insights is far from
straightforward. It has been a long-standing challenge to adopt automatic
opinion mining solutions for such education review text data due to the content
complexity and low-granularity reporting requirements. Aspect-based Sentiment
Analysis (ABSA) offers a promising solution with its rich, sub-sentence-level
opinion mining capabilities. However, existing ABSA research and resources are
very heavily focused on the commercial domain. In education, they are scarce
and hard to develop due to limited public datasets and strict data protection.
A high-quality, annotated dataset is urgently needed to advance research in
this under-resourced area. In this work, we present EduRABSA (Education Review
ABSA), the first public, annotated ABSA education review dataset that covers
three review subject types (course, teaching staff, university) in the English
language and all main ABSA tasks, including the under-explored implicit aspect
and implicit opinion extraction. We also share ASQE-DPT (Data Processing Tool),
an offline, lightweight, installation-free manual data annotation tool that
generates labelled datasets for comprehensive ABSA tasks from a single-task
annotation. Together, these resources contribute to the ABSA community and
education domain by removing the dataset barrier, supporting research
transparency and reproducibility, and enabling the creation and sharing of
further resources. The dataset, annotation tool, and scripts and statistics for
dataset processing and sampling are available at

Abstract: Our work addresses the challenges of understanding tables. Existing methods
often struggle with the unpredictable nature of table content, leading to a
reliance on preprocessing and keyword matching. They also face limitations due
to the lack of contextual information, which complicates the reasoning
processes of large language models (LLMs). To overcome these challenges, we
introduce an entity-oriented search method to improve table understanding with
LLMs. This approach effectively leverages the semantic similarities between

cells, minimizing the need for data preprocessing and keyword matching.
Additionally, it focuses on table entities, ensuring that table cells are
semantically tightly bound, thereby enhancing contextual clarity. Furthermore,
we pioneer the use of a graph query language for table understanding,
establishing a new research direction. Experiments show that our approach
achieves new state-of-the-art performances on standard benchmarks

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GRAID是一种新颖的数据增强方法，通过几何控制和多智能体反射过程来生成多样化的有害文本数据，显著提升有害文本分类模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决有害文本分类中数据稀缺的问题，特别是在护栏应用场景中需要大量标注数据来训练有效的分类模型。

Method: 采用两阶段管道：1) 使用约束LLM生成几何控制的示例；2) 通过多智能体反射过程进行增强，促进风格多样性并发现边缘案例。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上验证，使用GRAID增强的有害文本分类数据集显著提高了下游护栏模型的性能。

Conclusion: GRAID方法能够可靠地覆盖输入空间并进行有害内容的细致探索，为解决数据稀缺问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We address the problem of data scarcity in harmful text classification for
guardrailing applications and introduce GRAID (Geometric and Reflective
AI-Driven Data Augmentation), a novel pipeline that leverages Large Language
Models (LLMs) for dataset augmentation. GRAID consists of two stages: (i)
generation of geometrically controlled examples using a constrained LLM, and
(ii) augmentation through a multi-agentic reflective process that promotes
stylistic diversity and uncovers edge cases. This combination enables both
reliable coverage of the input space and nuanced exploration of harmful
content. Using two benchmark data sets, we demonstrate that augmenting a
harmful text classification dataset with GRAID leads to significant
improvements in downstream guardrail model performance.

TL;DR: BridgeX-ICL是一种通过共享神经元来提升低资源语言零样本跨语言上下文学习性能的有效方法，利用MUSE双语词典构建神经元探测数据，并通过HSIC度量选择最优语言桥接。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在低资源语言上性能提升面临挑战，需要无需昂贵微调的数据高效方法。从语言桥接视角出发，探索共享神经元是否能改善跨语言性能。

Method: 基于MUSE双语词典构建神经元探测数据，定义语言重叠神经元子集确保充分激活，提出基于HSIC的度量来量化语言谱并指导最优桥接选择。

Result: 在2个跨语言任务和15个语言对（涵盖7个不同语系）上的实验验证了BridgeX-ICL的有效性，并为LLMs的多语言机制提供了实证见解。

Conclusion: BridgeX-ICL通过探索共享神经元机制，为改善低资源语言的跨语言性能提供了简单而有效的方法，揭示了LLMs内部的多语言工作机制。

Abstract: The current Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in
improving performance on low-resource languages and urgently need
data-efficient methods without costly fine-tuning. From the perspective of
language-bridge, we propose BridgeX-ICL, a simple yet effective method to
improve zero-shot Cross-lingual In-Context Learning (X-ICL) for low-resource
languages. Unlike existing works focusing on language-specific neurons,
BridgeX-ICL explores whether sharing neurons can improve cross-lingual
performance in LLMs or not. We construct neuron probe data from the
ground-truth MUSE bilingual dictionaries, and define a subset of language
overlap neurons accordingly, to ensure full activation of these anchored
neurons. Subsequently, we propose an HSIC-based metric to quantify LLMs'
internal linguistic spectrum based on overlap neurons, which guides optimal
bridge selection. The experiments conducted on 2 cross-lingual tasks and 15
language pairs from 7 diverse families (covering both high-low and moderate-low
pairs) validate the effectiveness of BridgeX-ICL and offer empirical insights
into the underlying multilingual mechanisms of LLMs.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了大型语言模型中的标记同质化现象，即标记表征在转换器层中向均匀性收敛的过程，以及其与位置偏置之间的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索转换器模型中标记表征的演化模式，重点关注标记同质化现象是否存在以及位置偏置如何影响这一过程。

Method: 通过层次相似性分析和受控实验，系统性地检验标记在处理过程中的特异性丢失情况，尤其在偏向极端位置时的表现。

Result: 研究证实了标记同质化现象的存在，并发现这种现象与位置注意机制密切相关，位置偏置会改套标记同质化的程度。

Conclusion: 标记在转换器模型处理过程中存在系统性的同质化趋势，位置偏置是引起这种现象的关键因素，这为理解大型语言模型的内部工作机制提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This paper investigates token homogenization - the convergence of token
representations toward uniformity across transformer layers and its
relationship to positional bias in large language models. We empirically
examine whether homogenization occurs and how positional bias amplifies this
effect. Through layer-wise similarity analysis and controlled experiments, we
demonstrate that tokens systematically lose distinctiveness during processing,
particularly when biased toward extremal positions. Our findings confirm both
the existence of homogenization and its dependence on positional attention
mechanisms.

TL;DR: 结合转换器注意力机制和自然语言推理模型的优势，通过关键句子精准识别和关系分类，高效找到文档中与特定声明相关的前提和矛盾关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法的不足：转换器注意力能找到文本关联但缺乏语义标签，NLI模型能分类关系但无法考虑上下文显著性。

Method: 首先通过聚合标记注意力分数找到与目标句相关的候选句子，然后用预训练NLI模型将每个候选句分类为前提（含义）或矛盾，最后通过注意力显著性分数过滤NLI识别的关系。

Result: 能够高效地隔离文本中任何给定声明的最重要语义关系。

Conclusion: 该方法结合了上下文显著性和语义分类的优势，为文档句子关系分析提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Finding the relationships between sentences in a document is crucial for
tasks like fact-checking, argument mining, and text summarization. A key
challenge is to identify which sentences act as premises or contradictions for
a specific claim. Existing methods often face a trade-off: transformer
attention mechanisms can identify salient textual connections but lack explicit
semantic labels, while Natural Language Inference (NLI) models can classify
relationships between sentence pairs but operate independently of contextual
saliency. In this work, we introduce a method that combines the strengths of
both approaches for a targeted analysis. Our pipeline first identifies
candidate sentences that are contextually relevant to a user-selected target
sentence by aggregating token-level attention scores. It then uses a pretrained
NLI model to classify each candidate as a premise (entailment) or
contradiction. By filtering NLI-identified relationships with attention-based
saliency scores, our method efficiently isolates the most significant semantic
relationships for any given claim in a text.

TL;DR: 标题框架对用户后续搜索行为有显著影响，冲突和策略框架会破坏与先前选择的一致性，而情景框架比主题框架产生更具体的查询


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 搜索引擎在信息获取中起核心作用，但标题框架等微妙线索不仅影响用户信念，还可能影响搜索行为。虽然框架效应对判断的影响已有充分研究，但对后续搜索行为的影响了解较少

Method: 进行受控实验，参与者根据特定语言框架过滤的标题发出查询并进行选择

Result: 标题框架显著影响后续查询：冲突和策略框架破坏了与先前选择的一致性，情景框架比主题框架产生更具体的查询。观察到适度的短期框架持续性，但随时间推移而下降

Conclusion: 即使是短暂的框架暴露也能显著改变用户信息寻求行为的方向，这表明搜索引擎中的框架效应具有重要的行为影响

Abstract: Search engines play a central role in how people gather information, but
subtle cues like headline framing may influence not only what users believe but
also how they search. While framing effects on judgment are well documented,
their impact on subsequent search behavior is less understood. We conducted a
controlled experiment where participants issued queries and selected from
headlines filtered by specific linguistic frames. Headline framing
significantly shaped follow-up queries: conflict and strategy frames disrupted
alignment with prior selections, while episodic frames led to more concrete
queries than thematic ones. We also observed modest short-term frame
persistence that declined over time. These results suggest that even brief
exposure to framing can meaningfully alter the direction of users
information-seeking behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自盛学习语言识别模型在将同一语言的不同方言和口音类别化为统一类别时遇到困难，需要更好地处理语言内部变体。

Method: 提出在SSL基础的LID模型中添加语言级地理位置信息，通过地理位置预测辅助任务并将预测向量注入中间表征作为条件信号。

Result: 在6个多语言数据集上验证，方法提升了对语言内部变体和未见域的鲁棒性，在FLEURS数据集上达到97.7%的准确率，在ML-SUPERB 2.0方言集上相对提升9.7%。

Conclusion: 给位置感知的语言识别方法通过显式条件化有效地促使模型学习更统一的表征，在多个数据集上创造了新的最高水平。

Abstract: While Self-supervised Learning (SSL) has significantly improved Spoken
Language Identification (LID), existing models often struggle to consistently
classify dialects and accents of the same language as a unified class. To
address this challenge, we propose geolocation-aware LID, a novel approach that
incorporates language-level geolocation information into the SSL-based LID
model. Specifically, we introduce geolocation prediction as an auxiliary task
and inject the predicted vectors into intermediate representations as
conditioning signals. This explicit conditioning encourages the model to learn
more unified representations for dialectal and accented variations. Experiments
across six multilingual datasets demonstrate that our approach improves
robustness to intra-language variations and unseen domains, achieving new
state-of-the-art accuracy on FLEURS (97.7%) and 9.7% relative improvement on
ML-SUPERB 2.0 dialect set.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然现有研究已探讨自然语言满足性问题，但很少考虑不同计算复杂性类别对TLMs学习能力的影响，需要系统性研究这个问题。

Method: 通过实证研究探索不同计算复杂性类别和语法结构对TLMs学习推理规则的影响，并分析满足性问题的分布情况。

Result: 研究发现问题实例所属的计算复杂性类别和语法结构会显著影响TLMs的学习能力，不同语言片段的问题导致不同的学习效果。

Conclusion: 评估TLMs在自然语言推理任务上的性能时，必须考虑问题的计算复杂性类别和语法特征，这些因素对模型学习能力有重要影响。

Abstract: Efforts to apply transformer-based language models (TLMs) to the problem of
reasoning in natural language have enjoyed ever-increasing success in recent
years. The most fundamental task in this area to which nearly all others can be
reduced is that of determining satisfiability. However, from a logical point of
view, satisfiability problems vary along various dimensions, which may affect
TLMs' ability to learn how to solve them. The problem instances of
satisfiability in natural language can belong to different computational
complexity classes depending on the language fragment in which they are
expressed. Although prior research has explored the problem of natural language
satisfiability, the above-mentioned point has not been discussed adequately.
Hence, we investigate how problem instances from varying computational
complexity classes and having different grammatical constructs impact TLMs'
ability to learn rules of inference. Furthermore, to faithfully evaluate TLMs,
we conduct an empirical study to explore the distribution of satisfiability
problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大规模多语言评估结果存在分散性和多种因素混合的问题，特别是对低资源语言的评估面临挑战。需要一个更可靠的框架来解析这些混合因素并提供更深入的见解。

Method: 提出了一个框架，通过三个可解释的指标：性能实现比、其变异系数和语言潜力。这些指标能够分离目标语言、实验设置和模型选择等混合因素。

Result: 通过对13个模型变体在11个多语言数据集上的案例研究，证明了该框架能够提供更可靠的模型性能和语言差异测量，特别是对低资源语言。结果还显示高的总体模型性能并不一定意味着越大的语言公平性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的框架能够有效解析多语言评估中的混合因素，提供更精细和有见解的性能差异量化方法，对低资源语言的评估特别有价值。这个方法反显了模型性能与语言公平性之间的复杂关系。

Abstract: Results reported in large-scale multilingual evaluations are often fragmented
and confounded by factors such as target languages, differences in experimental
setups, and model choices. We propose a framework that disentangles these
confounding variables and introduces three interpretable metrics--the
performance realisation ratio, its coefficient of variation, and language
potential--enabling a finer-grained and more insightful quantification of
actual performance disparities across both (i) models and (ii) languages.
Through a case study of 13 model variants on 11 multilingual datasets, we
demonstrate that our framework provides a more reliable measurement of model
performance and language disparities, particularly for low-resource languages,
which have so far proven challenging to evaluate. Importantly, our results
reveal that higher overall model performance does not necessarily imply greater
fairness across languages.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在考虑标注者角色视角的情况下，对仇恨言论和侮辱性内容进行标注的能力，并与现有标注者建模技术进行比较

Method: 通过预定义的标注者角色在强到弱数据视角主义光谱下评估LLM生成的标注，与现有标注者建模技术进行对比分析

Result: LLMs有选择性地使用角色中的 demographic 属性；在弱数据视角主义下，不依赖标注者信息的模型表现优于强视角主义和人类标注；对于强视角主义个性化数据集，LLM标注接近但未超越人类表现

Conclusion: 尽管使用主观提示，LLM生成的视角倾向于聚合化；在强视角主义场景下，LLM标注者建模性能接近但未能超过人类标注者

Abstract: In this work, we explore the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
annotate hate speech and abusiveness while considering predefined annotator
personas within the strong-to-weak data perspectivism spectra. We evaluated
LLM-generated annotations against existing annotator modeling techniques for
perspective modeling. Our findings show that LLMs selectively use demographic
attributes from the personas. We identified prototypical annotators, with
persona features that show varying degrees of alignment with the original human
annotators. Within the data perspectivism paradigm, annotator modeling
techniques that do not explicitly rely on annotator information performed
better under weak data perspectivism compared to both strong data perspectivism
and human annotations, suggesting LLM-generated views tend towards aggregation
despite subjective prompting. However, for more personalized datasets tailored
to strong perspectivism, the performance of LLM annotator modeling approached,
but did not exceed, human annotators.

Abstract: Instruction tuning is a pivotal technique for aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human intentions, safety constraints, and domain-specific
requirements. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the full
pipeline, encompassing (i) data collection methodologies, (ii) full-parameter
and parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies, and (iii) evaluation protocols.
We categorized data construction into three major paradigms: expert annotation,
distillation from larger models, and self-improvement mechanisms, each offering
distinct trade-offs between quality, scalability, and resource cost.
Fine-tuning techniques range from conventional supervised training to
lightweight approaches, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and prefix tuning,
with a focus on computational efficiency and model reusability. We further
examine the challenges of evaluating faithfulness, utility, and safety across
multilingual and multimodal scenarios, highlighting the emergence of
domain-specific benchmarks in healthcare, legal, and financial applications.
Finally, we discuss promising directions for automated data generation,
adaptive optimization, and robust evaluation frameworks, arguing that a closer
integration of data, algorithms, and human feedback is essential for advancing
instruction-tuned LLMs. This survey aims to serve as a practical reference for
researchers and practitioners seeking to design LLMs that are both effective
and reliably aligned with human intentions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated an impressive level of general
knowledge. However, they often struggle in highly specialized and
cost-sensitive domains such as drug discovery and rare disease research due to
the lack of expert knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
(PU-ADKA) designed to efficiently enhance domain-specific LLMs by actively
engaging domain experts within a fixed budget. Unlike traditional fine-tuning
approaches, PU-ADKA selectively identifies and queries the most appropriate
expert from a team, taking into account each expert's availability, knowledge
boundaries, and consultation costs. We train PU-ADKA using simulations on
PubMed data and validate it through both controlled expert interactions and
real-world deployment with a drug development team, demonstrating its
effectiveness in enhancing LLM performance in specialized domains under strict
budget constraints. In addition to outlining our methodological innovations and
experimental results, we introduce a new benchmark dataset, CKAD, for
cost-effective LLM domain knowledge acquisition to foster further research in
this challenging area.

Conclusion: SSFO是第一个自监督对齐方法，能有效提升RAG系统的忠实度，无需额外成本，具有很好的实用性和泛化性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems require Large Language Models
(LLMs) to generate responses that are faithful to the retrieved context.
However, faithfulness hallucination remains a critical challenge, as existing
methods often require costly supervision and post-training or significant
inference burdens. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Self-Supervised
Faithfulness Optimization (SSFO), the first self-supervised alignment approach
for enhancing RAG faithfulness. SSFO constructs preference data pairs by
contrasting the model's outputs generated with and without the context.
Leveraging Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), SSFO aligns model faithfulness
without incurring labeling costs or additional inference burden. We
theoretically and empirically demonstrate that SSFO leverages a benign form of
\emph{likelihood displacement}, transferring probability mass from
parametric-based tokens to context-aligned tokens. Based on this insight, we
propose a modified DPO loss function to encourage likelihood displacement.
Comprehensive evaluations show that SSFO significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving state-of-the-art faithfulness on multiple context-based
question-answering datasets. Notably, SSFO exhibits strong generalization,
improving cross-lingual faithfulness and preserving general
instruction-following capabilities. We release our code and model at the

Abstract: Legal claims refer to the plaintiff's demands in a case and are essential to
guiding judicial reasoning and case resolution. While many works have focused
on improving the efficiency of legal professionals, the research on helping
non-professionals (e.g., plaintiffs) remains unexplored. This paper explores
the problem of legal claim generation based on the given case's facts. First,
we construct ClaimGen-CN, the first dataset for Chinese legal claim generation
task, from various real-world legal disputes. Additionally, we design an
evaluation metric tailored for assessing the generated claims, which
encompasses two essential dimensions: factuality and clarity. Building on this,
we conduct a comprehensive zero-shot evaluation of state-of-the-art general and
legal-domain large language models. Our findings highlight the limitations of
the current models in factual precision and expressive clarity, pointing to the
need for more targeted development in this domain. To encourage further
exploration of this important task, we will make the dataset publicly
available.

Conclusion: RouteDK通过有效的知识路由和冲突缓解机制，成功解决了蒸馏知识整合中的冲突问题，为高效准确的捆绑生成提供了可行方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in automatic bundle
generation but suffer from prohibitive computational costs. Although knowledge
distillation offers a pathway to more efficient student models, our preliminary
study reveals that naively integrating diverse types of distilled knowledge
from teacher LLMs into student LLMs leads to knowledge conflict, negatively
impacting the performance of bundle generation. To address this, we propose
RouteDK, a framework for routing distilled knowledge through a mixture of LoRA
expert architecture. Specifically, we first distill knowledge from the teacher
LLM for bundle generation in two complementary types: high-level knowledge
(generalizable rules) and fine-grained knowledge (session-specific reasoning).
We then train knowledge-specific LoRA experts for each type of knowledge
together with a base LoRA expert. For effective integration, we propose a
dynamic fusion module, featuring an input-aware router, where the router
balances expert contributions by dynamically determining optimal weights based
on input, thereby effectively mitigating knowledge conflicts. To further
improve inference reliability, we design an inference-time enhancement module
to reduce variance and mitigate suboptimal reasoning. Experiments on three
public datasets show that our RouteDK achieves accuracy comparable to or even
better than the teacher LLM, while maintaining strong computational efficiency.
In addition, it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for bundle generation.

Abstract: Aspect-category sentiment analysis provides granular insights by identifying
specific themes within product reviews that are associated with particular
opinions. Supervised learning approaches dominate the field. However, data is
scarce and expensive to annotate for new domains. We argue that leveraging
large language models in a zero-shot setting is beneficial where the time and
resources required for dataset annotation are limited. Furthermore, annotation
bias may lead to strong results using supervised methods but transfer poorly to
new domains in contexts that lack annotations and demand reproducibility. In
our work, we propose novel techniques that combine multiple chain-of-thought
agents by leveraging large language models' token-level uncertainty scores. We
experiment with the 3B and 70B+ parameter size variants of Llama and Qwen
models, demonstrating how these approaches can fulfil practical needs and
opening a discussion on how to gauge accuracy in label-scarce conditions.

Abstract: The pursuit of human-level artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly
advanced the development of autonomous agents and Large Language Models (LLMs).
LLMs are now widely utilized as decision-making agents for their ability to
interpret instructions, manage sequential tasks, and adapt through feedback.
This review examines recent developments in employing LLMs as autonomous agents
and tool users and comprises seven research questions. We only used the papers
published between 2023 and 2025 in conferences of the A* and A rank and Q1
journals. A structured analysis of the LLM agents' architectural design
principles, dividing their applications into single-agent and multi-agent
systems, and strategies for integrating external tools is presented. In
addition, the cognitive mechanisms of LLM, including reasoning, planning, and
memory, and the impact of prompting methods and fine-tuning procedures on agent
performance are also investigated. Furthermore, we evaluated current benchmarks
and assessment protocols and have provided an analysis of 68 publicly available
datasets to assess the performance of LLM-based agents in various tasks. In
conducting this review, we have identified critical findings on verifiable
reasoning of LLMs, the capacity for self-improvement, and the personalization
of LLM-based agents. Finally, we have discussed ten future research directions
to overcome these gaps.

Abstract: Interactive online learning environments, represented by Massive AI-empowered
Courses (MAIC), leverage LLM-driven multi-agent systems to transform passive
MOOCs into dynamic, text-based platforms, enhancing interactivity through LLMs.
This paper conducts an empirical study on a specific MAIC course to explore
three research questions about dropouts in these interactive online courses:
(1) What factors might lead to dropouts? (2) Can we predict dropouts? (3) Can
we reduce dropouts? We analyze interaction logs to define dropouts and identify
contributing factors. Our findings reveal strong links between dropout
behaviors and textual interaction patterns. We then propose a
course-progress-adaptive dropout prediction framework (CPADP) to predict
dropouts with at most 95.4% accuracy. Based on this, we design a personalized
email recall agent to re-engage at-risk students. Applied in the deployed MAIC
system with over 3,000 students, the feasibility and effectiveness of our
approach have been validated on students with diverse backgrounds.

*Haojie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DropLoRA是一种基于剪枝的参数高效微调方法，通过在LoRA的两个低秩矩阵间插入剪枝模块来模拟动态子空间学习，克服传统LoRA静态子空间的限制，显著提升性能且不增加训练/推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA方法使用低秩分解近似参数更新，但与全参数微调相比存在性能差距。低秩更新往往导致下游任务性能瓶颈，需要克服静态子空间学习的限制。

Method: 在LoRA的两个低秩矩阵之间集成剪枝模块，通过剪枝秩维度来模拟动态子空间学习。这种方法能够持续调整学习子空间，而不增加额外的训练或推理开销。

Result: 在LLaMA系列模型的大规模语言模型生成任务中，包括常识推理、数学推理、代码生成和指令跟随等任务上，DropLoRA始终优于传统LoRA方法。

Conclusion: DropLoRA通过动态低秩子空间学习有效克服了传统LoRA的静态子空间限制，在保持参数高效的同时显著提升了微调性能，为大规模语言模型的参数高效微调提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: LoRA-based large model parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods use
low-rank de- composition to approximate updates to model parameters. However,
compared to full- parameter fine-tuning, low-rank updates often lead to a
performance gap in downstream tasks. To address this, we introduce DropLoRA, a
novel pruning-based approach that focuses on pruning the rank dimension. Unlike
conven- tional methods that attempt to overcome the low-rank bottleneck,
DropLoRA innovatively integrates a pruning module between the two low-rank
matrices in LoRA to simulate dy- namic subspace learning. This dynamic low-
rank subspace learning allows DropLoRA to overcome the limitations of
traditional LoRA, which operates within a static subspace. By continuously
adapting the learning subspace, DropLoRA significantly boosts performance
without incurring additional training or infer- ence costs. Our experimental
results demon- strate that DropLoRA consistently outperforms LoRA in
fine-tuning the LLaMA series across a wide range of large language model gener-
ation tasks, including commonsense reason- ing, mathematical reasoning, code
generation, and instruction-following. Our code is avail- able at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过构建日本行政法院判决的法律知识图谱，提出法律推理组件并通过法律推理本体连接事实、法律规范和法律适用，实现了更准确的法律条文检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动化法律推理方法存在无法准确识别相关法律上下文、不能准确追踪事实与法律规范关系、可能误表右室推理层级结构等问题，影响对法院实践中法律适用的理解。

Method: 从648份日本行政法院判决中构建法律知识图谱，使用prompt-based大语言模型提取法律推理组件，标准化法律条文引用，通过法律推理本体连接事实、规范和法律适用。

Result: 系统能够捐捕实际法院判决中的完整法律推理结构，将隐式推理显示化并变为机器可读。在专家注释数据评估中，该方法在从事实检索相关法律条文方面超过了大语言模型基线和检索增强方法。

Conclusion: 通过法律知识图谱构建方法，有效解决了自动化法律推理中的关键挑战，能够更准确地捐捕法院实践中法律适用的完整结构，为法律智能分析提供了可靠的技术支撑。

Abstract: Court judgments reveal how legal rules have been interpreted and applied to
facts, providing a foundation for understanding structured legal reasoning.
However, existing automated approaches for capturing legal reasoning, including
large language models, often fail to identify the relevant legal context, do
not accurately trace how facts relate to legal norms, and may misrepresent the
layered structure of judicial reasoning. These limitations hinder the ability
to capture how courts apply the law to facts in practice. In this paper, we
address these challenges by constructing a legal knowledge graph from 648
Japanese administrative court decisions. Our method extracts components of
legal reasoning using prompt-based large language models, normalizes references
to legal provisions, and links facts, norms, and legal applications through an
ontology of legal inference. The resulting graph captures the full structure of
legal reasoning as it appears in real court decisions, making implicit
reasoning explicit and machine-readable. We evaluate our system using expert
annotated data, and find that it achieves more accurate retrieval of relevant
legal provisions from facts than large language model baselines and
retrieval-augmented methods.

TL;DR: 阿拉伯方言词汇普遍性评分系统，通过词语对齐和语源知识计算词汇在各地方言中的普遍使用程度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的阿拉伯方言评测量ALDi将复杂的方言变体简化为单一维度，需要补充性方法来帮助建模词汇级别的普遍性

Method: 提出阿拉伯普遍性评分(AGS)测量，构建包含词语对齐、语源感知编辑距离和平滑处理的流水线，在并行语料库中注释词级AGS，然后训练回归模型预测上下文中的AGS

Result: 方法在多方言测试集上超过了包括最先进方言识别系统在内的强基线模型

Conclusion: AGS提供了一种可扩展、语言学基础的方法来建模词汇普遍性，丰富了对阿拉伯方言性的表征

Abstract: Arabic dialects form a diverse continuum, yet NLP models often treat them as
discrete categories. Recent work addresses this issue by modeling dialectness
as a continuous variable, notably through the Arabic Level of Dialectness
(ALDi). However, ALDi reduces complex variation to a single dimension. We
propose a complementary measure: the Arabic Generality Score (AGS), which
quantifies how widely a word is used across dialects. We introduce a pipeline
that combines word alignment, etymology-aware edit distance, and smoothing to
annotate a parallel corpus with word-level AGS. A regression model is then
trained to predict AGS in context. Our approach outperforms strong baselines,
including state-of-the-art dialect ID systems, on a multi-dialect benchmark.
AGS offers a scalable, linguistically grounded way to model lexical generality,
enriching representations of Arabic dialectness.

TL;DR: 对ALLaM-34B阿拉伯语大模型进行扩展评估，在多个阿拉伯语任务上表现出色，特别是在生成和语码转换任务上表现优异，展现了强大的技术实力和实际部署准备度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决主要基于英语语料训练的大语言模型在捕捉阿拉伯语语言和文化细微差别方面的不足，评估专门针对阿拉伯语优化的ALLaM-34B模型的性能。

Method: 使用包含现代标准阿拉伯语、五种地区方言、语码转换、事实知识、算术和时间推理、创造性生成以及对抗性安全性的提示包，收集115个输出，由三个前沿LLM评委（GPT-5、Gemini 2.5 Pro、Claude Sonnet-4）进行评分，计算类别级均值并分析分数分布。

Result: ALLaM-34B在生成和语码转换任务上平均得分4.92/5，现代标准阿拉伯语处理4.74/5，推理能力4.64/5，方言保真度4.21/5，安全相关提示稳定性能4.54/5。

Conclusion: ALLaM-34B是一个强大且文化根基深厚的阿拉伯语大语言模型，展现了技术实力和实际部署准备度，为阿拉伯语AI应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained primarily on English corpora often
struggle to capture the linguistic and cultural nuances of Arabic. To address
this gap, the Saudi Data and AI Authority (SDAIA) introduced the $ALLaM$ family
of Arabic-focused models. The most capable of these available to the public,
$ALLaM-34B$, was subsequently adopted by HUMAIN, who developed and deployed
HUMAIN Chat, a closed conversational web service built on this model. This
paper presents an expanded and refined UI-level evaluation of $ALLaM-34B$.
Using a prompt pack spanning modern standard Arabic, five regional dialects,
code-switching, factual knowledge, arithmetic and temporal reasoning, creative
generation, and adversarial safety, we collected 115 outputs (23 prompts times
5 runs) and scored each with three frontier LLM judges (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro,
Claude Sonnet-4). We compute category-level means with 95\% confidence
intervals, analyze score distributions, and visualize dialect-wise metric heat
maps. The updated analysis reveals consistently high performance on generation
and code-switching tasks (both averaging 4.92/5), alongside strong results in
MSA handling (4.74/5), solid reasoning ability (4.64/5), and improved dialect
fidelity (4.21/5). Safety-related prompts show stable, reliable performance of
(4.54/5). Taken together, these results position $ALLaM-34B$ as a robust and
culturally grounded Arabic LLM, demonstrating both technical strength and
practical readiness for real-world deployment.

Motivation: 当前LLM代理的评估主要依赖静态基准测试和小规模人工研究，缺乏高效、全面的自动化测试方法

Method: 结合静态代码分析、设计者询问、文献挖掘和角色驱动的对抗测试生成，通过法官反馈自适应调整测试难度，使用LLM作为法官进行评分

Result: 在旅行规划器和维基百科写作器上，ATA在20-30分钟内发现比专家标注者更多样化和严重的故障，匹配严重性水平

Conclusion: ATA提供了一种高效、可扩展的代理测试方法，输出量化指标和定性错误报告，代码分析和网络搜索对减少方差和校准错误至关重要

Abstract: LLM agents are increasingly deployed to plan, retrieve, and write with tools,
yet evaluation still leans on static benchmarks and small human studies. We
present the Agent-Testing Agent (ATA), a meta-agent that combines static code
analysis, designer interrogation, literature mining, and persona-driven
adversarial test generation whose difficulty adapts via judge feedback. Each
dialogue is scored with an LLM-as-a-Judge (LAAJ) rubric and used to steer
subsequent tests toward the agent's weakest capabilities. On a travel planner
and a Wikipedia writer, the ATA surfaces more diverse and severe failures than
expert annotators while matching severity, and finishes in 20--30 minutes
versus ten-annotator rounds that took days. Ablating code analysis and web
search increases variance and miscalibration, underscoring the value of
evidence-grounded test generation. The ATA outputs quantitative metrics and
qualitative bug reports for developers. We release the full methodology and
open-source implementation for reproducible agent testing:

TL;DR: DashboardQA是首个专门评估视觉语言GUI代理理解交互式仪表板能力的基准测试，包含112个交互式仪表板和405个问答对，测试结果显示当前最先进的代理在此任务上表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据可视化问答基准主要关注静态图表，忽视了交互式仪表板的重要性，无法有效评估现代多模态GUI代理的能力。

Method: 创建DashboardQA基准，包含来自Tableau Public的112个交互式仪表板和405个问答对，涵盖五种问题类型：多选题、事实型、假设型、多仪表板和对话型。

Result: 评估显示当前GUI代理在仪表板推理方面表现不佳，最佳代理（基于Gemini-Pro-2.5）准确率仅为38.69%，OpenAI CUA代理仅为22.69%。

Conclusion: 交互式仪表板推理对所有评估的VLM来说都是具有挑战性的任务，现有代理在仪表板元素定位、交互轨迹规划和推理方面存在明显局限性。

Abstract: Dashboards are powerful visualization tools for data-driven decision-making,
integrating multiple interactive views that allow users to explore, filter, and
navigate data. Unlike static charts, dashboards support rich interactivity,
which is essential for uncovering insights in real-world analytical workflows.
However, existing question-answering benchmarks for data visualizations largely
overlook this interactivity, focusing instead on static charts. This limitation
severely constrains their ability to evaluate the capabilities of modern
multimodal agents designed for GUI-based reasoning. To address this gap, we
introduce DashboardQA, the first benchmark explicitly designed to assess how
vision-language GUI agents comprehend and interact with real-world dashboards.
The benchmark includes 112 interactive dashboards from Tableau Public and 405
question-answer pairs with interactive dashboards spanning five categories:
multiple-choice, factoid, hypothetical, multi-dashboard, and conversational. By
assessing a variety of leading closed- and open-source GUI agents, our analysis
reveals their key limitations, particularly in grounding dashboard elements,
planning interaction trajectories, and performing reasoning. Our findings
indicate that interactive dashboard reasoning is a challenging task overall for
all the VLMs evaluated. Even the top-performing agents struggle; for instance,
the best agent based on Gemini-Pro-2.5 achieves only 38.69% accuracy, while the
OpenAI CUA agent reaches just 22.69%, demonstrating the benchmark's significant
difficulty. We release DashboardQA at https://github.com/vis-nlp/DashboardQA

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 声明归一化是自动事实核查系统的关键组成部分，需要将嘈杂的社交媒体帖子等声明数据解析为规范化声明，以供下游真实性分类任务使用。

Method: 采用检索优先、LLM支持的轻量级管道：动态提示GPT-4o-mini并提供上下文示例，或直接从训练数据集中检索最接近的归一化结果。

Result: 在官方测试集上，系统在大多数单语轨道中排名靠前，在13种语言中的7种获得第一名，但在零样本设置中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 提出的解决方案在单语环境下表现优异，但在零样本环境下存在局限性，需要进一步改进跨语言泛化能力。

Abstract: Claim normalization is an integral part of any automatic fact-check
verification system. It parses the typically noisy claim data, such as social
media posts into normalized claims, which are then fed into downstream veracity
classification tasks. The CheckThat! 2025 Task 2 focuses specifically on claim
normalization and spans 20 languages under monolingual and zero-shot
conditions. Our proposed solution consists of a lightweight
\emph{retrieval-first, LLM-backed} pipeline, in which we either dynamically
prompt a GPT-4o-mini with in-context examples, or retrieve the closest
normalization from the train dataset directly. On the official test set, the
system ranks near the top for most monolingual tracks, achieving first place in
7 out of of the 13 languages. In contrast, the system underperforms in the
zero-shot setting, highlighting the limitation of the proposed solution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在说服性对话中难以平衡对错误信息的轻信和对正确修正的抵抗，这对可靠部署构成关键挑战。

Method: 引入DuET-PD双评估框架，从说服类型（纠正性/误导性）和领域（知识/安全）两个维度评估多轮立场变化动态；提出Holistic DPO训练方法，平衡正负说服样本。

Result: GPT-4o在持续误导性说服下MMLU-Pro准确率仅27.32%；新开源模型呈现日益严重的谄媚趋势；Holistic DPO将Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct在安全上下文误导性说服下的准确率从4.21%提升至76.54%。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发更可靠、适应性强的多轮对话LLM提供了有效途径，Holistic DPO方法能同时增强对错误信息的鲁棒性和对正确修正的接受度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can struggle to balance gullibility to
misinformation and resistance to valid corrections in persuasive dialogues, a
critical challenge for reliable deployment. We introduce DuET-PD (Dual
Evaluation for Trust in Persuasive Dialogues), a framework evaluating
multi-turn stance-change dynamics across dual dimensions: persuasion type
(corrective/misleading) and domain (knowledge via MMLU-Pro, and safety via
SALAD-Bench). We find that even a state-of-the-art model like GPT-4o achieves
only 27.32% accuracy in MMLU-Pro under sustained misleading persuasions.
Moreover, results reveal a concerning trend of increasing sycophancy in newer
open-source models. To address this, we introduce Holistic DPO, a training
approach balancing positive and negative persuasion examples. Unlike prompting
or resist-only training, Holistic DPO enhances both robustness to

### [256] [Evaluating the Impact of Verbal Multiword Expressions on Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17458)
*Linfeng Liu,Saptarshi Ghosh,Tianyu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究分析了三类动词性多词表达式（成语、动词-小品词结构、轻动词结构）对机器翻译质量的影响，发现这些结构会降低翻译质量，并提出基于LLM的释义方法显著改善了成语和动词-小品词结构的翻译效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动词性多词表达式因其复杂性和非组合性特点，对自然语言处理构成重大挑战。尽管机器翻译模型近年来有所改进，但准确翻译这些复杂语言结构仍是一个未解决的问题。

Method: 使用已建立的多词表达式数据集和从机器翻译数据集中提取的包含这些语言现象的句子，评估最先进翻译系统对这些表达式的处理能力，并提出基于LLM的释义方法将这些表达式替换为字面对应词。

Result: 实验结果表明动词性多词表达式对翻译质量产生负面影响。基于LLM的释义方法在动词成语和动词-小品词结构的翻译质量上显示出显著改善。

Conclusion: 动词性多词表达式是机器翻译中的难点，但通过释义方法可以有效改善翻译质量，特别是对于成语和小品词结构，为处理这类语言现象提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Verbal multiword expressions (VMWEs) present significant challenges for
natural language processing due to their complex and often non-compositional
nature. While machine translation models have seen significant improvement with
the advent of language models in recent years, accurately translating these
complex linguistic structures remains an open problem. In this study, we
analyze the impact of three VMWE categories -- verbal idioms, verb-particle
constructions, and light verb constructions -- on machine translation quality
from English to multiple languages. Using both established multiword expression
datasets and sentences containing these language phenomena extracted from
machine translation datasets, we evaluate how state-of-the-art translation
systems handle these expressions. Our experimental results consistently show
that VMWEs negatively affect translation quality. We also propose an LLM-based
paraphrasing approach that replaces these expressions with their literal
counterparts, demonstrating significant improvement in translation quality for
verbal idioms and verb-particle constructions.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于句子排名的高效零检知长文档分类方法，通过TF-IDF策略选择最关键的50%句子，在保持分类准确性的同时将推理时间减少35%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer模型在长文档分类中遇到的输入长度限制和计算效率低下的问题

Method: 使用TF-IDF基于的句子排名策略，选择最信息丰富的句子来缩减输入上下文，无需改变模型架构

Result: 在MahaNews马拉尼语新闻数据集上，保留前50%的排名句子可以维持与全文档相似的分类性能，同时推理时间减少35%

Conclusion: 句子排名是一种简单但有效的技术，能够实现可扩展和高效的零检知长文档分类

Abstract: Transformer-based models like BERT excel at short text classification but
struggle with long document classification (LDC) due to input length
limitations and computational inefficiencies. In this work, we propose an
efficient, zero-shot approach to LDC that leverages sentence ranking to reduce
input context without altering the model architecture. Our method enables the
adaptation of models trained on short texts, such as headlines, to long-form
documents by selecting the most informative sentences using a TF-IDF-based
ranking strategy. Using the MahaNews dataset of long Marathi news articles, we
evaluate three context reduction strategies that prioritize essential content
while preserving classification accuracy. Our results show that retaining only
the top 50\% ranked sentences maintains performance comparable to full-document
inference while reducing inference time by up to 35\%. This demonstrates that
sentence ranking is a simple yet effective technique for scalable and efficient
zero-shot LDC.

TL;DR: 提出了首个端到端的法语SSML标签插入管道，通过两个QLoRA微调的Qwen 2.5-7B模型实现韵律控制，显著提升了合成语音的表现力和自然度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业文本转语音系统在韵律控制方面存在局限性，导致合成语音缺乏表现力，需要开发能够精确控制音高、语速、音量和停顿时长的解决方案

Method: 采用级联架构，使用两个QLoRA微调的Qwen 2.5-7B模型：一个预测短语断点位置，另一个对韵律目标进行回归分析，生成商业TTS兼容的SSML标记

Result: 在14小时法语播客语料上，断点放置F1达到99.2%，音高、语速和音量的平均绝对误差比仅使用提示的LLM和BiLSTM基线降低25-40%。感知评估中，平均意见分从3.20提升到3.87，18名参与者中有15人偏好增强后的合成语音

Conclusion: 该方法在弥合法语合成语音与自然语音之间的表现力差距方面取得了实质性进展，显著提升了合成语音的自然度和用户偏好

Abstract: Despite recent advances, synthetic voices often lack expressiveness due to
limited prosody control in commercial text-to-speech (TTS) systems. We
introduce the first end-to-end pipeline that inserts Speech Synthesis Markup
Language (SSML) tags into French text to control pitch, speaking rate, volume,
and pause duration. We employ a cascaded architecture with two QLoRA-fine-tuned
Qwen 2.5-7B models: one predicts phrase-break positions and the other performs
regression on prosodic targets, generating commercial TTS-compatible SSML
markup. Evaluated on a 14-hour French podcast corpus, our method achieves 99.2%
F1 for break placement and reduces mean absolute error on pitch, rate, and
volume by 25-40% compared with prompting-only large language models (LLMs) and
a BiLSTM baseline. In perceptual evaluation involving 18 participants across
over 9 hours of synthesized audio, SSML-enhanced speech generated by our
pipeline significantly improves naturalness, with the mean opinion score
increasing from 3.20 to 3.87 (p < 0.005). Additionally, 15 of 18 listeners
preferred our enhanced synthesis. These results demonstrate substantial
progress in bridging the expressiveness gap between synthetic and natural
French speech. Our code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 多智能体辩论(MAD)的性能提升主要来自多数投票而非辩论过程本身，理论分析表明辩论不会提高期望正确率，简单集成方法在实际应用中更可靠


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多智能体辩论在提升大语言模型性能方面显示出潜力，但其有效性的关键驱动因素尚不明确，需要系统分析辩论和投票各自的贡献

Method: 将MAD解构为多数投票和智能体间辩论两个关键组件，通过7个NLP基准实验评估各自贡献，提出理论框架将辩论建模为随机过程，证明其产生信念轨迹的鞅性质

Result: 多数投票单独贡献了MAD大部分性能提升，辩论过程本身不会提高期望正确率，但通过偏向修正的针对性干预可以增强辩论效果

Conclusion: MAD虽有潜力，但在许多实际场景中简单集成方法仍是更强大可靠的替代方案，需要更有效的辩论机制设计

Abstract: Multi-Agent Debate~(MAD) has emerged as a promising paradigm for improving
the performance of large language models through collaborative reasoning.
Despite recent advances, the key factors driving MAD's effectiveness remain
unclear. In this work, we disentangle MAD into two key components--Majority
Voting and inter-agent Debate--and assess their respective contributions.
Through extensive experiments across seven NLP benchmarks, we find that
Majority Voting alone accounts for most of the performance gains typically
attributed to MAD. To explain this, we propose a theoretical framework that
models debate as a stochastic process. We prove that it induces a martingale
over agents' belief trajectories, implying that debate alone does not improve
expected correctness. Guided by these insights, we demonstrate that targeted
interventions, by biasing the belief update toward correction, can meaningfully
enhance debate effectiveness. Overall, our findings suggest that while MAD has
potential, simple ensembling methods remain strong and more reliable
alternatives in many practical settings. Code is released in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前关于LLM拟人化的研究主要关注风险（如过度信任和用户欺骗），缺乏设计指导。作者认为拟人化应被视为可有意调整以支持用户目标的设计概念。

Method: 从多学科视角提出LLM拟人化应反映设计者与解释者之间的互动，通过设计者嵌入的线索和解释者的认知响应来实现。将线索分为感知、语言、行为和认知四个维度进行分析。

Result: 建立了统一的拟人化分类体系，为从业者提供了可操作的设计杠杆，并主张进行功能导向的拟人化设计评估。

Conclusion: 拟人化应作为设计概念被有意调谐，通过四个维度的线索设计来优化人机交互体验，而非仅仅被视为风险问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly exhibit \textbf{anthropomorphism}
characteristics -- human-like qualities portrayed across their outlook,
language, behavior, and reasoning functions. Such characteristics enable more
intuitive and engaging human-AI interactions. However, current research on
anthropomorphism remains predominantly risk-focused, emphasizing over-trust and
user deception while offering limited design guidance. We argue that
anthropomorphism should instead be treated as a \emph{concept of design} that
can be intentionally tuned to support user goals. Drawing from multiple
disciplines, we propose that the anthropomorphism of an LLM-based artifact
should reflect the interaction between artifact designers and interpreters.
This interaction is facilitated by cues embedded in the artifact by the
designers and the (cognitive) responses of the interpreters to the cues. Cues
are categorized into four dimensions: \textit{perceptive, linguistic,
behavioral}, and \textit{cognitive}. By analyzing the manifestation and
effectiveness of each cue, we provide a unified taxonomy with actionable levers
for practitioners. Consequently, we advocate for function-oriented evaluations
of anthropomorphic design.

Motivation: 尽管现代NLP模型性能优异，但其决策过程仍是黑盒。因果NLP领域旨在结合因果推断和NLP模型来阐明文本特征的因果效应，提高模型可解释性。

Method: 开发了基于RieszNet的双头神经网络架构CausalSent，用于更准确地估计处理效应。在半合成的IMDB影评数据上进行实验，并通过集成验证模型进行观察性案例研究。

Result: CausalSent在处理效应估计准确性上显著提升，MAE比Bansal等人的方法降低了2-3倍。案例研究发现"love"一词的存在会导致正面情感概率增加2.9%。

Conclusion: 提出的CausalSent框架能够更准确地估计文本特征的因果效应，为理解NLP模型决策提供了有效的可解释性工具，在情感分析等任务中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Despite the overwhelming performance improvements offered by recent natural
language procesing (NLP) models, the decisions made by these models are largely
a black box. Towards closing this gap, the field of causal NLP combines causal
inference literature with modern NLP models to elucidate causal effects of text
features. We replicate and extend Bansal et al's work on regularizing text
classifiers to adhere to estimated effects, focusing instead on model
interpretability. Specifically, we focus on developing a two-headed
RieszNet-based neural network architecture which achieves better treatment
effect estimation accuracy. Our framework, CausalSent, accurately predicts
treatment effects in semi-synthetic IMDB movie reviews, reducing MAE of effect
estimates by 2-3x compared to Bansal et al's MAE on synthetic Civil Comments
data. With an ensemble of validated models, we perform an observational case
study on the causal effect of the word "love" in IMDB movie reviews, finding
that the presence of the word "love" causes a +2.9% increase in the probability
of a positive sentiment.

Motivation: 解决现有基准测试中难度与真实性的矛盾：考试式基准往往人为制造难度但缺乏实际价值，而基于真实用户交互的基准又偏向简单高频问题

Method: 收集500个来自Stack Exchange的未解决问题，结合规则过滤、LLM判断和人工审核确保问题质量；使用复合验证策略利用生成器-验证器差距提供评估信号；建立开放平台让专家集体验证问题和解决方案

Result: 最佳模型仅通过15%问题的UQ验证，初步人工验证已在通过验证的答案中识别出正确答案

Conclusion: UQ为评估前沿模型在真实世界开放性挑战上的表现开辟了新路径，成功解决这些问题将推动人类知识前沿的发展

Abstract: Benchmarks shape progress in AI research. A useful benchmark should be both
difficult and realistic: questions should challenge frontier models while also
reflecting real-world usage. Yet, current paradigms face a difficulty-realism
tension: exam-style benchmarks are often made artificially difficult with
limited real-world value, while benchmarks based on real user interaction often
skew toward easy, high-frequency problems. In this work, we explore a radically
different paradigm: assessing models on unsolved questions. Rather than a
static benchmark scored once, we curate unsolved questions and evaluate models
asynchronously over time with validator-assisted screening and community
verification. We introduce UQ, a testbed of 500 challenging, diverse questions
sourced from Stack Exchange, spanning topics from CS theory and math to sci-fi
and history, probing capabilities including reasoning, factuality, and
browsing. UQ is difficult and realistic by construction: unsolved questions are
often hard and naturally arise when humans seek answers, thus solving them
yields direct real-world value. Our contributions are threefold: (1) UQ-Dataset
and its collection pipeline combining rule-based filters, LLM judges, and human
review to ensure question quality (e.g., well-defined and difficult); (2)
UQ-Validators, compound validation strategies that leverage the
generator-validator gap to provide evaluation signals and pre-screen candidate
solutions for human review; and (3) UQ-Platform, an open platform where experts
collectively verify questions and solutions. The top model passes UQ-validation
on only 15% of questions, and preliminary human verification has already
identified correct answers among those that passed. UQ charts a path for
evaluating frontier models on real-world, open-ended challenges, where success
pushes the frontier of human knowledge. We release UQ at

Motivation: 探索模型剪枝对LLM生成意见摘要公平性的影响，特别是在可能影响公众观点的偏见输出方面

Method: 提出了High Gradient Low Activation (HGLA)剪枝方法，识别并移除对输入处理冗余但对输出生成有影响的参数

Result: HGLA方法相比现有剪枝方法能更好地维持或提高公平性，人类评估显示HGLA生成的输出更公平

Conclusion: 剪枝方法对公平性的影响比校准集更大，HGLA方法在模型和任务中显示出比传统方法更好的前景

Abstract: Model compression through post-training pruning offers a way to reduce model
size and computational requirements without significantly impacting model
performance. However, the effect of pruning on the fairness of LLM-generated
summaries remains unexplored, particularly for opinion summarisation where
biased outputs could influence public views.In this paper, we present a
comprehensive empirical analysis of opinion summarisation, examining three
state-of-the-art pruning methods and various calibration sets across three
open-source LLMs using four fairness metrics. Our systematic analysis reveals
that pruning methods have a greater impact on fairness than calibration sets.
Building on these insights, we propose High Gradient Low Activation (HGLA)
pruning, which identifies and removes parameters that are redundant for input
processing but influential in output generation. Our experiments demonstrate
that HGLA can better maintain or even improve fairness compared to existing
methods, showing promise across models and tasks where traditional methods have
limitations. Our human evaluation shows HGLA-generated outputs are fairer than
existing state-of-the-art pruning methods. Code is available at:

Motivation: 现有激活引导方法要么对所有生成内容进行无差别干预，要么仅依赖问题来决定干预，无法准确评估干预强度，且检测到偏离后干预往往为时已晚。

Method: FASB框架动态跟踪LLM生成过程中的内部状态，综合考虑问题和已生成内容来决定干预的必要性和强度，并引入回溯机制来纠正已偏离的token。

Result: 在TruthfulQA数据集和六个多选题数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法优于基线方法。

Conclusion: FASB框架通过动态状态跟踪和回溯机制，有效解决了现有激活引导方法的局限性，实现了更精准和及时的干预。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across many
generation tasks. Nevertheless, effectively aligning them with desired
behaviors remains a significant challenge. Activation steering is an effective
and cost-efficient approach that directly modifies the activations of LLMs
during the inference stage, aligning their responses with the desired behaviors
and avoiding the high cost of fine-tuning. Existing methods typically
indiscriminately intervene to all generations or rely solely on the question to
determine intervention, which limits the accurate assessment of the
intervention strength. To this end, we propose the Flexible Activation Steering
with Backtracking (FASB) framework, which dynamically determines both the
necessity and strength of intervention by tracking the internal states of the
LLMs during generation, considering both the question and the generated
content. Since intervening after detecting a deviation from the desired
behavior is often too late, we further propose the backtracking mechanism to
correct the deviated tokens and steer the LLMs toward the desired behavior.
Extensive experiments on the TruthfulQA dataset and six multiple-choice
datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines. Our code will be
released at https://github.com/gjw185/FASB.

Abstract: Speech emotions play a crucial role in human-computer interaction, shaping
engagement and context-aware communication. Despite recent advances in spoken
dialogue systems, a holistic system for evaluating emotional reasoning is still
lacking. To address this, we introduce EMO-Reasoning, a benchmark for assessing
emotional coherence in dialogue systems. It leverages a curated dataset
generated via text-to-speech to simulate diverse emotional states, overcoming
the scarcity of emotional speech data. We further propose the Cross-turn
Emotion Reasoning Score to assess the emotion transitions in multi-turn
dialogues. Evaluating seven dialogue systems through continuous, categorical,
and perceptual metrics, we show that our framework effectively detects
emotional inconsistencies, providing insights for improving current dialogue
systems. By releasing a systematic evaluation benchmark, we aim to advance
emotion-aware spoken dialogue modeling toward more natural and adaptive
interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂推理任务中会出现过度思考现象，导致性能下降和资源浪费。观察到思考长度和内容长度的模式变化，需要找到补偿推理阶段结束的精确检测点。

Method: 将推理分为三个阶段：探索不足阶段、补偿推理阶段和推理收敛阶段。挖掘敏感的RCP模式，开发基于启发式规则的轻量级阈值策略来检测推理完成点。

Result: 在AIME24、AIME25、GPQA-D等基准测试中，该方法减少了token消耗，同时保持或提高了推理准确性。

Conclusion: 通过检测推理完成点可以有效缓解大语言模型的过度思考问题，实现资源使用效率和推理性能的平衡。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enhance complex reasoning tasks by scaling the
individual thinking process. However, prior work shows that overthinking can
degrade overall performance. Motivated by observed patterns in thinking length
and content length, we categorize reasoning into three stages: insufficient
exploration stage, compensatory reasoning stage, and reasoning convergence
stage. Typically, LLMs produce correct answers in the compensatory reasoning
stage, whereas reasoning convergence often triggers overthinking, causing
increased resource usage or even infinite loops. Therefore, mitigating
overthinking hinges on detecting the end of the compensatory reasoning stage,
defined as the Reasoning Completion Point (RCP). RCP typically appears at the
end of the first complete reasoning cycle and can be identified by querying the
LLM sentence by sentence or monitoring the probability of an end-of-thinking
token (e.g., \texttt{</think>}), though these methods lack an efficient and
precise balance. To improve this, we mine more sensitive and consistent RCP
patterns and develop a lightweight thresholding strategy based on heuristic
rules. Experimental evaluations on benchmarks (AIME24, AIME25, GPQA-D)
demonstrate that the proposed method reduces token consumption while preserving
or enhancing reasoning accuracy.

Motivation: DPO在LLM对齐中存在奖励黑客问题，模型过度降低被拒绝补全的概率以获得高奖励，导致生成长度过长、缺乏多样性以及灾难性遗忘知识

Method: 提出权重旋转偏好优化(RoPO)算法，在DPO的KL散度约束基础上，通过多粒度正交矩阵对中间隐藏状态进行显式约束，防止策略模型过度偏离参考模型

Result: 在AlpacaEval 2上提升3.27分，在MT-Bench上超越最佳基线6.2-7.5分，仅使用0.015%的可训练参数

Conclusion: RoPO能有效缓解DPO的奖励黑客问题，保留预训练和SFT阶段获得的知识和表达能力

Abstract: Despite the efficacy of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in aligning
Large Language Models (LLMs), reward hacking remains a pivotal challenge. This
issue emerges when LLMs excessively reduce the probability of rejected
completions to achieve high rewards, without genuinely meeting their intended
goals. As a result, this leads to overly lengthy generation lacking diversity,
as well as catastrophic forgetting of knowledge. We investigate the underlying
reason behind this issue, which is representation redundancy caused by neuron
collapse in the parameter space. Hence, we propose a novel Weights-Rotated
Preference Optimization (RoPO) algorithm, which implicitly constrains the
output layer logits with the KL divergence inherited from DPO and explicitly
constrains the intermediate hidden states by fine-tuning on a multi-granularity
orthogonal matrix. This design prevents the policy model from deviating too far
from the reference model, thereby retaining the knowledge and expressive
capabilities acquired during pre-training and SFT stages. Our RoPO achieves up
to a 3.27-point improvement on AlpacaEval 2, and surpasses the best baseline by
6.2 to 7.5 points on MT-Bench with merely 0.015% of the trainable parameters,
demonstrating its effectiveness in alleviating the reward hacking problem of
DPO.

Conclusion: 虽然半自动方法有潜力，但全自动文献综述生成在质量和深度方面仍需改进，需要更好的质量感知机制

Abstract: Automatic survey generation has emerged as a key task in scientific document
processing. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating
survey texts, the lack of standardized evaluation datasets critically hampers
rigorous assessment of their performance against human-written surveys. In this
work, we present SurveyGen, a large-scale dataset comprising over 4,200
human-written surveys across diverse scientific domains, along with 242,143
cited references and extensive quality-related metadata for both the surveys
and the cited papers. Leveraging this resource, we build QUAL-SG, a novel
quality-aware framework for survey generation that enhances the standard
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline by incorporating quality-aware
indicators into literature retrieval to assess and select higher-quality source
papers. Using this dataset and framework, we systematically evaluate
state-of-the-art LLMs under varying levels of human involvement - from fully
automatic generation to human-guided writing. Experimental results and human
evaluations show that while semi-automatic pipelines can achieve partially
competitive outcomes, fully automatic survey generation still suffers from low
citation quality and limited critical analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在参数化记忆与外部上下文之间存在知识冲突时，现有对比解码方法缺乏适应性且在低冲突场景下性能下降，需要一种更灵活可靠的冲突解决方法。

Method: 提出CoCoA算法，利用熵差和上下文峰值度等置信度感知度量，以及参数化分布与上下文分布之间的广义散度，进行基于token级别的自适应冲突解决。

Result: 在多个LLM上的问答、摘要和长格式问答基准测试中，CoCoA相比AdaCAD等强基线在QA准确率上平均提升9.2个百分点，在摘要和LFQA事实性上平均提升2.5个百分点，展现出对冲突变化的优异敏感性。

Conclusion: CoCoA能够实现更明智、上下文感知且最终更忠实的token生成，为LLM中的知识冲突问题提供了有效的自适应解决方案。

Abstract: Faithful generation in large language models (LLMs) is challenged by
knowledge conflicts between parametric memory and external context. Existing
contrastive decoding methods tuned specifically to handle conflict often lack
adaptability and can degrade performance in low conflict settings. We introduce
CoCoA (Confidence- and Context-Aware Adaptive Decoding), a novel token-level
algorithm for principled conflict resolution and enhanced faithfulness. CoCoA
resolves conflict by utilizing confidence-aware measures (entropy gap and
contextual peakedness) and the generalized divergence between the parametric
and contextual distributions. Crucially, CoCoA maintains strong performance
even in low conflict settings. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs on
diverse Question Answering (QA), Summarization, and Long-Form Question
Answering (LFQA) benchmarks demonstrate CoCoA's state-of-the-art performance
over strong baselines like AdaCAD. It yields significant gains in QA accuracy,
up to 9.2 points on average compared to the strong baseline AdaCAD, and
improves factuality in summarization and LFQA by up to 2.5 points on average
across key benchmarks. Additionally, it demonstrates superior sensitivity to
conflict variations. CoCoA enables more informed, context-aware, and ultimately
more faithful token generation.

*Danny Wang,Ruihong Qiu,Guangdong Bai,Zi Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了TextTopoOOD框架和TNT-OOD方法，用于解决文本丰富网络中复杂的分布外检测问题，通过融合文本和拓扑特征来应对多种OOD场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要处理标签偏移或简单域分割，忽略了文本-结构多样性的复杂性。在社交网络等文本丰富网络中，OOD可能源于不同用户群体（如机器人和正常用户）的独特语言模式与拓扑结构的交织。

Method: 1) TextTopoOOD框架评估四种OOD场景：属性级偏移、结构偏移、主题引导标签偏移和域分割；2) TNT-OOD方法使用交叉注意力模块融合局部结构到节点级文本表示，以及超网络生成节点特定转换参数。

Result: 在11个数据集和四种OOD场景上的实验证明了TextTopoOOD框架在评估文本丰富网络OOD检测方面的细致挑战。

Conclusion: 该方法通过对齐ID节点的拓扑和语义特征，增强了在结构和文本偏移下的ID/OOD区分能力，为文本丰富网络的OOD检测提供了新的评估框架和解决方案。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection remains challenging in text-rich
networks, where textual features intertwine with topological structures.
Existing methods primarily address label shifts or rudimentary domain-based
splits, overlooking the intricate textual-structural diversity. For example, in
social networks, where users represent nodes with textual features (name, bio)
while edges indicate friendship status, OOD may stem from the distinct language
patterns between bot and normal users. To address this gap, we introduce the
TextTopoOOD framework for evaluating detection across diverse OOD scenarios:
(1) attribute-level shifts via text augmentations and embedding perturbations;
(2) structural shifts through edge rewiring and semantic connections; (3)
thematically-guided label shifts; and (4) domain-based divisions. Furthermore,
we propose TNT-OOD to model the complex interplay between Text aNd Topology
using: 1) a novel cross-attention module to fuse local structure into
node-level text representations, and 2) a HyperNetwork to generate
node-specific transformation parameters. This aligns topological and semantic
features of ID nodes, enhancing ID/OOD distinction across structural and
textual shifts. Experiments on 11 datasets across four OOD scenarios
demonstrate the nuanced challenge of TextTopoOOD for evaluating OOD detection
in text-rich networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究前馈网络在Transformer不同层的重要性分布，探索在保持总参数量不变的情况下，如何优化FFN的层间分配

Method: 通过改变FFN维度（增加某些层的FFN维度，完全移除其他层的FFN）来重新分配参数，使用285M、570M和1.2B参数的不同规模模型进行从头训练实验

Result: 在多个下游任务中，将FFN集中在70%的连续中间层的配置持续优于标准均匀分布配置

Conclusion: FFN在Transformer不同层的重要性存在差异，中间层对FFN的需求更为关键，这种非均匀的FFN分配策略可以提升模型性能

Abstract: This study investigates the layerwise importance of feed-forward networks
(FFNs) in Transformer-based language models during pretraining. We introduce an
experimental approach that, while maintaining the total parameter count,
increases the FFN dimensions in some layers and completely removes the FFNs
from other layers. Furthermore, since our focus is on the importance of FFNs
during pretraining, we train models from scratch to examine whether the
importance of FFNs varies depending on their layer positions, rather than using
publicly available pretrained models as is frequently done. Through
comprehensive evaluations of models with varying sizes (285M, 570M, and 1.2B
parameters) and layer counts (12, 24, and 40 layers), we demonstrate that
concentrating FFNs in 70% of the consecutive middle layers consistently
outperforms standard configurations for multiple downstream tasks.

Method: 引入动态验证集概念（随测试集演变），并提出SMITE迭代算法选择最优上下文示例，每个示例集都通过对应的动态验证集进行验证，选择总误差最低的上下文集作为最终演示集

Result: 在四种不同LLM上的实验表明，所提技术相比基线方法显著提高了预测准确性和公平性

Conclusion: 这是首个在LLM上下文学习中应用动态验证的研究，为提升LLM性能和公平性提供了有效的新方法

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for downstream tasks such as
tabular classification, where ensuring fairness in their outputs is critical
for inclusivity, equal representation, and responsible AI deployment. This
study introduces a novel approach to enhancing LLM performance and fairness
through the concept of a dynamic validation set, which evolves alongside the
test set, replacing the traditional static validation approach. We also propose
an iterative algorithm, SMITE, to select optimal in-context examples, with each
example set validated against its corresponding dynamic validation set. The
in-context set with the lowest total error is used as the final demonstration
set. Our experiments across four different LLMs show that our proposed
techniques significantly improve both predictive accuracy and fairness compared
to baseline methods. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply dynamic
validation in the context of in-context learning for LLMs.

Motivation: LLM在训练过程中可能无意间暴露受版权保护或专有数据，传统方法只能在内容生成后处理，存在敏感信息泄露风险

Method: 使用精选的版权材料数据集训练神经网络分类器，在文本生成前分析LLM内部状态来识别风险，并与RAG系统集成实现早期干预

Result: 分析内部状态的方法能有效降低版权数据泄露风险，提供可扩展的解决方案，确保遵守版权法规的同时保持高质量的文本生成

Conclusion: 该方法为AI工作流程提供了主动的版权保护机制，增强了数据隐私和伦理标准，实现代码已在GitHub开源

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
(NLP) but pose risks of inadvertently exposing copyrighted or proprietary data,
especially when such data is used for training but not intended for
distribution. Traditional methods address these leaks only after content is
generated, which can lead to the exposure of sensitive information. This study
introduces a proactive approach: examining LLMs' internal states before text
generation to detect potential leaks. By using a curated dataset of copyrighted
materials, we trained a neural network classifier to identify risks, allowing
for early intervention by stopping the generation process or altering outputs
to prevent disclosure. Integrated with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
system, this framework ensures adherence to copyright and licensing
requirements while enhancing data privacy and ethical standards. Our results
show that analyzing internal states effectively mitigates the risk of
copyrighted data leakage, offering a scalable solution that fits smoothly into
AI workflows, ensuring compliance with copyright regulations while maintaining
high-quality text generation. The implementation is available on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现GPT词汇表中许多中文词汇表示色情和赌博内容，需要系统识别这些污染词汇并研究其与训练数据的关系

Method: 1) 基于GPT词汇表定义污染词汇分类 2) 微调LLM构建污染词汇检测器 3) 通过词汇出现频率推测训练数据污染程度

Result: GPT词汇表表现最差，超过23%的长中文词汇涉及色情或赌博；推测GPT-4o训练数据中约0.5%与特定色情内容相关

Conclusion: LLM词汇表中广泛存在污染词汇，GPT问题最严重，训练数据污染程度可通过词汇分析进行推测

Abstract: Tokens are basic elements in the datasets for LLM training. It is well-known
that many tokens representing Chinese phrases in the vocabulary of GPT
(4o/4o-mini/o1/o3/4.5/4.1/o4-mini) are indicating contents like pornography or
online gambling. Based on this observation, our goal is to locate Polluted
Chinese (PoC) tokens in LLMs and study the relationship between PoC tokens'
existence and training data. (1) We give a formal definition and taxonomy of
PoC tokens based on the GPT's vocabulary. (2) We build a PoC token detector via
fine-tuning an LLM to label PoC tokens in vocabularies by considering each
token's both semantics and related contents from the search engines. (3) We
study the speculation on the training data pollution via PoC tokens'
appearances (token ID). Experiments on GPT and other 23 LLMs indicate that
tokens widely exist while GPT's vocabulary behaves the worst: more than 23%
long Chinese tokens (i.e., a token with more than two Chinese characters) are
either porn or online gambling. We validate the accuracy of our speculation
method on famous pre-training datasets like C4 and Pile. Then, considering
GPT-4o, we speculate that the ratio of "Yui Hatano" related webpages in
GPT-4o's training data is around 0.5%.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语音合成的多发音上下文偏置方法，在预训练的Whisper模型上实现零样本上下文ASR，通过TTS合成多样发音样本提取变体，构建前缀树在beam搜索中奖励相关假设，显著降低偏置词错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决上下文ASR中识别词汇外单词（如命名实体或罕见词）的挑战，这些单词存在训练数据有限、发音模糊或不一致的问题。

Method: 利用TTS系统合成包含目标罕见词的多样化语音样本，使用预训练Whisper模型提取多个预测发音变体，构建前缀树在beam搜索解码过程中以浅层融合方式奖励相关假设，最后将识别的变体映射回原始罕见词。

Result: 在Librispeech数据集上，偏置词错误率在test-clean上降低42%，在test-other上降低43%，同时保持非偏置词错误率基本不变。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了罕见词识别问题，显著提升了上下文ASR系统的性能，同时保持了模型的通用性。

Abstract: Contextual automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems allow for recognizing
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, such as named entities or rare words. However,
it remains challenging due to limited training data and ambiguous or
inconsistent pronunciations. In this paper, we propose a synthesis-driven
multi-pronunciation contextual biasing method that performs zero-shot
contextual ASR on a pretrained Whisper model. Specifically, we leverage
text-to-speech (TTS) systems to synthesize diverse speech samples containing
each target rare word, and then use the pretrained Whisper model to extract
multiple predicted pronunciation variants. These variant token sequences are
compiled into a prefix-trie, which assigns rewards to beam hypotheses in a
shallow-fusion manner during beam-search decoding. After which, any recognized
variant is mapped back to the original rare word in the final transcription.
The evaluation results on the Librispeech dataset show that our method reduces
biased word error rate (WER) by 42% on test-clean and 43% on test-other while
maintaining unbiased WER essentially unchanged.

Motivation: 解决推理大语言模型(RLLMs)存在的过度思考问题，即对简单问题产生不必要的冗长推理链，导致计算效率低下

Method: 提出动态推理配额分配(DRQA)方法，利用批量生成的偏好数据和强化学习，训练模型自适应分配推理资源，鼓励模型生成准确且简洁的响应

Result: 在广泛的数学和科学推理基准测试中，DRQA显著减少了token使用量，同时保持甚至提高了答案准确性

Conclusion: DRQA有效缓解了过度思考问题，为RLLMs更高效和可扩展的部署提供了有前景的方向

Abstract: Reasoning large language models (RLLMs), such as OpenAI-O3 and DeepSeek-R1,
have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities by performing structured and
multi-step reasoning. However, recent studies reveal that RLLMs often suffer
from overthinking, i.e., producing unnecessarily lengthy reasoning chains even
for simple questions, leading to excessive token consumption and computational
inefficiency. Interestingly, we observe that when processing multiple questions
in batch mode, RLLMs exhibit more resource-efficient behavior by dynamically
compressing reasoning steps for easier problems, due to implicit resource
competition. Inspired by this, we propose Dynamic Reasoning Quota Allocation
(DRQA), a novel method that transfers the benefits of resource competition from
batch processing to single-question inference. Specifically, DRQA leverages
batch-generated preference data and reinforcement learning to train the model
to allocate reasoning resources adaptively. By encouraging the model to
internalize a preference for responses that are both accurate and concise, DRQA
enables it to generate concise answers for simple questions while retaining
sufficient reasoning depth for more challenging ones. Extensive experiments on
a wide range of mathematical and scientific reasoning benchmarks demonstrate
that DRQA significantly reduces token usage while maintaining, and in many
cases improving, answer accuracy. By effectively mitigating the overthinking
problem, DRQA offers a promising direction for more efficient and scalable
deployment of RLLMs, and we hope it inspires further exploration into
fine-grained control of reasoning behaviors.

Motivation: 随着语音大语言模型的发展，出现了离散token和连续特征两种主要语音处理方法，但两者之间的性能差异尚未得到充分探索，需要进行公平的比较研究。

Conclusion: 研究结果为推进语音大语言模型中的口语理解提供了有价值的见解，表明连续特征在多数情况下表现更好，但两种方法各有特点。

Abstract: With the rise of Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs), two dominant
approaches have emerged for speech processing: discrete tokens and continuous
features. Each approach has demonstrated strong capabilities in audio-related
processing tasks. However, the performance gap between these two paradigms has
not been thoroughly explored. To address this gap, we present a fair comparison
of self-supervised learning (SSL)-based discrete and continuous features under
the same experimental settings. We evaluate their performance across six spoken
language understanding-related tasks using both small and large-scale LLMs
(Qwen1.5-0.5B and Llama3.1-8B). We further conduct in-depth analyses, including
efficient comparison, SSL layer analysis, LLM layer analysis, and robustness
comparison. Our findings reveal that continuous features generally outperform
discrete tokens in various tasks. Each speech processing method exhibits
distinct characteristics and patterns in how it learns and processes speech
information. We hope our results will provide valuable insights to advance
spoken language understanding in SpeechLLMs.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在长上下文场景中存在有效上下文长度短、二次计算复杂度和高内存开销等问题，需要一种高效的上下文压缩方法。

Method: 提出中间层检索(ILRe)管道：离线确定中间解码器层，通过流式分块预填充编码上下文，使用注意力分数在指定层中召回令牌，并采用多池化核分配策略保持语义完整性。

Result: ILRe能在30秒内处理100万令牌请求(加速约180倍)，在RULER-1M基准测试中获得79.8分，性能与完整上下文相当或更好。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外训练或算子开发，有效解决了LLMs在长上下文处理中的计算和内存瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated success across many
benchmarks. However, they still exhibit limitations in long-context scenarios,
primarily due to their short effective context length, quadratic computational
complexity, and high memory overhead when processing lengthy inputs. To
mitigate these issues, we introduce a novel context compression pipeline,
called Intermediate Layer Retrieval (ILRe), which determines one intermediate
decoder layer offline, encodes context by streaming chunked prefill only up to
that layer, and recalls tokens by the attention scores between the input query
and full key cache in that specified layer. In particular, we propose a
multi-pooling kernels allocating strategy in the token recalling process to
maintain the completeness of semantics. Our approach not only reduces the
prefilling complexity from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L)$, but also achieves performance
comparable to or better than the full context in the long context scenarios.
Without additional post training or operator development, ILRe can process a
single $1M$ tokens request in less than half a minute (speedup $\approx
180\times$) and scores RULER-$1M$ benchmark of $\approx 79.8$ with model
Llama-3.1-UltraLong-8B-1M-Instruct on a Huawei Ascend 910B NPU.

Result: 在三个SKR任务的六个基准测试中，Pandora超越了现有统一推理框架，并能与任务特定方法有效竞争

Conclusion: Pandora通过统一的代码表示和知识迁移机制，成功实现了跨结构化知识推理任务的高效统一处理

Abstract: Unified Structured Knowledge Reasoning (USKR) aims to answer natural language
questions by using structured sources such as tables, databases, and knowledge
graphs in a unified way. Existing USKR methods rely on task-specific strategies
or bespoke representations, which hinder their ability to dismantle barriers
between different SKR tasks, thereby constraining their overall performance in
cross-task scenarios. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{Pandora}, a novel
USKR framework that addresses the limitations of existing methods by leveraging
two key innovations. First, we propose a code-based unified knowledge
representation using \textsc{Python}'s \textsc{Pandas} API, which aligns
seamlessly with the pre-training of LLMs. This representation facilitates a
cohesive approach to handling different structured knowledge sources. Building
on this foundation, we employ knowledge transfer to bolster the unified
reasoning process of LLMs by automatically building cross-task memory. By
adaptively correcting reasoning using feedback from code execution,
\textsc{Pandora} showcases impressive unified reasoning capabilities. Extensive
experiments on six widely used benchmarks across three SKR tasks demonstrate
that \textsc{Pandora} outperforms existing unified reasoning frameworks and
competes effectively with task-specific methods.

Motivation: 互联网起源于英语国家，导致英语在网络内容中占据主导地位，但全球只有20-25%的人口以英语为母语，大量非英语用户因语言障碍无法充分访问网络信息。

Method: 通过分析互联网用户增长数据和多语言使用现状，探讨多语言信息获取的技术约束和解决方案。

Conclusion: 需要进一步开发和完善多语言技术解决方案，以消除语言障碍，让更多非英语用户能够平等地访问互联网信息。

Abstract: The usage of Internet has grown exponentially over the last two decades. The
number of Internet users has grown from 16 Million to 1650 Million from 1995 to
2010. It has become a major repository of information catering almost every
area. Since the Internet has its origin in USA which is English speaking
country there is huge dominance of English on the World Wide Web. Although
English is a globally acceptable language, still there is a huge population in
the world which is not able to access the Internet due to language constraints.
It has been estimated that only 20-25% of the world population speaks English
as a native language. More and more people are accessing the Internet nowadays
removing the cultural and linguistic barriers and hence there is a high growth
in the number of non-English speaking users over the last few years on the
Internet. Although many solutions have been provided to remove the linguistic
barriers, still there is a huge gap to be filled. This paper attempts to
analyze the need of information availability in different languages and the
various technological constraints related to multi-linguism on the Internet.

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised method for detecting loanwords i.e., words

introduce circularity and constraints into the historical linguistics workflow.
In contrast, our model relies solely on language-internal information to

wordlists. By extracting pertinent linguistic features, scoring them, and
mapping them probabilistically, we iteratively refine initial results by
identifying and generalizing from emerging patterns until convergence. This
hybrid approach leverages both linguistic and statistical cues to guide the
discovery process. We evaluate our method on the task of isolating loanwords in
datasets from six standard Indo-European languages: English, German, French,
Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese. Experimental results demonstrate that our
model outperforms baseline methods, with strong performance gains observed when
scaling to cross-linguistic data.

*Henri Savigny,Bruno Yun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何利用单一大型语言模型执行多个论证挖掘任务，通过构建多任务数据集并探索不同训练策略，发现任务特定微调能显著提升性能，多任务微调保持强性能，模型合并提供计算成本与性能的平衡方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 论证挖掘旨在从自然语言文本中自动提取论证结构和关系，但现有研究多关注单一任务。本文探索如何利用单个大型语言模型处理多个论证挖掘任务，以提高效率和性能。

Method: 构建了包含19个知名论证挖掘数据集的统一格式多任务数据集，使用Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct模型探索三种训练策略：单任务微调、多任务联合微调、以及分别微调后模型合并。

Result: 任务特定微调在所有任务上显著提升个体性能；多任务微调保持强性能且无性能退化，表明相关任务间存在有效迁移学习；模型合并提供竞争性性能同时降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 单一大型语言模型可通过适当训练策略有效处理多个论证挖掘任务，多任务微调实现性能保持，模型合并提供计算效率与性能的平衡解决方案。

Abstract: Argument mining is a subfield of argumentation that aims to automatically
extract argumentative structures and their relations from natural language
texts. This paper investigates how a single large language model can be
leveraged to perform one or several argument mining tasks. Our contributions
are two-fold. First, we construct a multi-task dataset by surveying and
converting 19 well-known argument mining datasets from the literature into a
unified format. Second, we explore various training strategies using Meta AI's
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model: (1) fine-tuning on individual tasks, (2)
fine-tuning jointly on multiple tasks, and (3) merging models fine-tuned
separately on individual tasks. Our experiments show that task-specific
fine-tuning significantly improves individual performance across all tasks.
Moreover, multi-task fine-tuning maintains strong performance without
degradation, suggesting effective transfer learning across related tasks.
Finally, we demonstrate that model merging offers a viable compromise: it
yields competitive performance while mitigating the computational costs
associated with full multi-task fine-tuning.

*Qiwei Peng,Guimin Hu,Yekun Chai,Anders Søgaard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出在联合潜在空间而非直接在LLM表示上进行去偏处理，通过使用平行语料训练的自动编码器构建对齐的跨语言潜在空间，显著提升了去偏效果和跨语言迁移能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的去偏技术（如SentDebias）在多语言环境中的效果有限，直接应用于LLM表示时跨语言迁移能力不足，因此需要探索更有效的跨语言去偏方法。

Method: 使用平行TED演讲脚本训练自动编码器构建对齐的跨语言潜在空间，在该空间内应用去偏技术，在Aya-expanse模型和四种语言（英、法、德、荷）上进行实验。

Result: 自动编码器能有效构建对齐的跨语言潜在空间，在该空间内应用去偏技术显著提升了整体去偏性能和跨语言迁移能力。

Conclusion: 在联合潜在空间中进行去偏处理比直接在LLM表示上操作更有效，为跨语言去偏提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Debiasing techniques such as SentDebias aim to reduce bias in large language
models (LLMs). Previous studies have evaluated their cross-lingual
transferability by directly applying these methods to LLM representations,
revealing their limited effectiveness across languages. In this work, we
therefore propose to perform debiasing in a joint latent space rather than
directly on LLM representations. We construct a well-aligned cross-lingual
latent space using an autoencoder trained on parallel TED talk scripts. Our
experiments with Aya-expanse and two debiasing techniques across four languages
(English, French, German, Dutch) demonstrate that a) autoencoders effectively
construct a well-aligned cross-lingual latent space, and b) applying debiasing
techniques in the learned cross-lingual latent space significantly improves
both the overall debiasing performance and cross-lingual transferability.

TL;DR: 该论文通过实验探究大型语言模型如何组合子词信息，发现了三种不同的组合模式，反映了不同LLM家族在子词组合策略上的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs如何将子词表示有效组合成有意义的词级表示，理解其组合机制和动态过程。

Method: 设计全面的实验集，从结构相似性、语义可分解性和形式特征保留三个关键方面探测LLMs的子词组合能力。

Result: 发现五个LLM家族可分为三组不同组合模式；观察到跨层结构相似性演变的三种模式；在语义可分解性探测中表现优异；在形式特征敏感性方面发现三种不同模式。

Conclusion: 研究结果提供了对LLMs组合动态的宝贵见解，揭示了不同LLM在编码和整合子词信息时的不同组合模式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) take sequences of subwords as input, requiring
them to effective compose subword representations into meaningful word-level
representations. In this paper, we present a comprehensive set of experiments
to probe how LLMs compose subword information, focusing on three key aspects:
structural similarity, semantic decomposability, and form retention. Our
analysis of the experiments suggests that these five LLM families can be
classified into three distinct groups, likely reflecting difference in their
underlying composition strategies. Specifically, we observe (i) three distinct
patterns in the evolution of structural similarity between subword compositions
and whole-word representations across layers; (ii) great performance when
probing layer by layer their sensitivity to semantic decompositionality; and
(iii) three distinct patterns when probing sensitivity to formal features,
e.g., character sequence length. These findings provide valuable insights into
the compositional dynamics of LLMs and highlight different compositional
pattens in how LLMs encode and integrate subword information.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文质疑大语言模型作为评估者（LLJs）的可靠性，认为当前对其热情可能过早，需要更严格的验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在自然语言生成评估中的广泛应用，其作为评估工具的效度和信度尚未得到充分验证，存在盲目采纳的风险。

Method: 基于社会科学中的测量理论，批判性分析LLJs作为评估工具的四个核心假设：人类判断代理能力、评估能力、可扩展性和成本效益。

Result: 发现LLJs在文本摘要、数据标注和安全对齐等应用中存在固有局限性，当前实践可能无法确保评估的有效性。

Conclusion: 呼吁在LLJs评估中采取更负责任的做法，确保其应用能够支持而非阻碍自然语言生成领域的发展。

Abstract: Evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems remains a core challenge
of natural language processing (NLP), further complicated by the rise of large
language models (LLMs) that aims to be general-purpose. Recently, large
language models as judges (LLJs) have emerged as a promising alternative to
traditional metrics, but their validity remains underexplored. This position
paper argues that the current enthusiasm around LLJs may be premature, as their
adoption has outpaced rigorous scrutiny of their reliability and validity as
evaluators. Drawing on measurement theory from the social sciences, we identify
and critically assess four core assumptions underlying the use of LLJs: their
ability to act as proxies for human judgment, their capabilities as evaluators,
their scalability, and their cost-effectiveness. We examine how each of these
assumptions may be challenged by the inherent limitations of LLMs, LLJs, or
current practices in NLG evaluation. To ground our analysis, we explore three
applications of LLJs: text summarization, data annotation, and safety
alignment. Finally, we highlight the need for more responsible evaluation
practices in LLJs evaluation, to ensure that their growing role in the field
supports, rather than undermines, progress in NLG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全面评估量化如何影响模型偏见，特别关注其对不同人口统计子群体的影响，研究权重和激活量化策略在各种偏见类型上的效果

Method: 使用概率性和生成文本指标，在9个基准测试上评估不同架构家族和推理能力的模型，分析权重和激活量化策略

Result: 量化对偏见的影响复杂：降低模型毒性且不影响情感，但会轻微增加刻板印象和生成任务中的不公平性，特别是在激进压缩下。这些趋势在不同人口类别和模型类型中基本一致

Conclusion: 在实际应用量化时需要仔细平衡效率和伦理考虑，量化对模型偏见的影响需要谨慎评估

Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive evaluation of how quantization affects
model bias, with particular attention to its impact on individual demographic
subgroups. We focus on weight and activation quantization strategies and
examine their effects across a broad range of bias types, including
stereotypes, toxicity, sentiment, and fairness. We employ both probabilistic
and generated text-based metrics across nine benchmarks and evaluate models
varying in architecture family and reasoning ability. Our findings show that
quantization has a nuanced impact on bias: while it can reduce model toxicity
and does not significantly impact sentiment, it tends to slightly increase
stereotypes and unfairness in generative tasks, especially under aggressive
compression. These trends are generally consistent across demographic
categories and model types, although their magnitude depends on the specific
setting. Overall, our results highlight the importance of carefully balancing
efficiency and ethical considerations when applying quantization in practice.

TL;DR: 本研究探索了基于语音的AI方法在检测多发性硬化症患者抑郁情绪时的可迁移性，通过跨语料库和跨语言分析发现语音特征可以有效识别抑郁状态，在有限数据下达到74%的识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症常与多发性硬化症等神经退行性疾病共病，但基于语音的人工智能检测方法在此类情境中的应用尚未被探索，需要研究其可迁移性和有效性。

Method: 采用监督机器学习模型，使用三种特征：1)传统语音和语言特征；2)语音情感识别模型提取的情感维度；3)探索性语音特征分析。进行跨语料库（普通人群英语数据）和跨语言（德语多发性硬化症患者数据）分析。

Result: 在有限数据条件下，模型能够以中等泛化能力检测多发性硬化症患者的抑郁情绪，二元任务达到66%的未加权平均召回率。特征选择后性能提升至74%。情感变化在普通人群和多发性硬化症患者中都是抑郁情绪的重要指标。

Conclusion: 该研究为基于语音的抑郁检测方法在存在共病条件（如神经退行性疾病）情况下的泛化应用提供了初步探索，证明了该方法即使在复杂临床情境中仍具有可行性。

Abstract: Depression commonly co-occurs with neurodegenerative disorders like Multiple
Sclerosis (MS), yet the potential of speech-based Artificial Intelligence for
detecting depression in such contexts remains unexplored. This study examines
the transferability of speech-based depression detection methods to people with
MS (pwMS) through cross-corpus and cross-lingual analysis using English data
from the general population and German data from pwMS. Our approach implements
supervised machine learning models using: 1) conventional speech and language
features commonly used in the field, 2) emotional dimensions derived from a
Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) model, and 3) exploratory speech feature
analysis. Despite limited data, our models detect depressive mood in pwMS with
moderate generalisability, achieving a 66% Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) on a
binary task. Feature selection further improved performance, boosting UAR to
74%. Our findings also highlight the relevant role emotional changes have as an
indicator of depressive mood in both the general population and within PwMS.
This study provides an initial exploration into generalising speech-based
depression detection, even in the presence of co-occurring conditions, such as
neurodegenerative diseases.

Motivation: 评估长上下文LLM在专业工业领域的技术问答能力，模拟跨语言信息检索场景，包括不可回答问题来测试幻觉现象。

Method: 构建基于农业机器手册的多语言QA测试集，比较九个长上下文LLM与三种RAG策略（关键词、语义、混合）的表现，使用LLM作为评判者进行评估。

Result: 混合RAG在这个特定手册中持续超过直接长上下文提示。Gemini 2.5 Flash和Qwen 2.5 7B模型使用RAG时在所有语言上都获得超85%的高准确率。

Conclusion: 论文提供了专业工业领域LLM性能的详细分析和开放框架，强调了实际应用中的权衡和挑战，混合RAG在这种专业场景中显示出更优的性能。

Abstract: We present a case study evaluating large language models (LLMs) with
128K-token context windows on a technical question answering (QA) task. Our
benchmark is built on a user manual for an agricultural machine, available in
English, French, and German. It simulates a cross-lingual information retrieval
scenario where questions are posed in English against all three language
versions of the manual. The evaluation focuses on realistic
"needle-in-a-haystack" challenges and includes unanswerable questions to test
for hallucinations. We compare nine long-context LLMs using direct prompting
against three Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategies (keyword,
semantic, hybrid), with an LLM-as-a-judge for evaluation. Our findings for this
specific manual show that Hybrid RAG consistently outperforms direct
long-context prompting. Models like Gemini 2.5 Flash and the smaller Qwen 2.5
7B achieve high accuracy (over 85%) across all languages with RAG. This paper
contributes a detailed analysis of LLM performance in a specialized industrial
domain and an open framework for similar evaluations, highlighting practical
trade-offs and challenges.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了检测LLM规划行为的因果标准和方法，发现在不同模型和任务中规划行为存在差异，指令微调会优化而非创造规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究假设固定的规划视野且局限于单一领域，需要区分LLM的规划行为和即兴生成行为，并建立可复现的检测方法。

Method: 提出了形式化和因果基础的规划检测标准，开发了半自动化标注流程，应用于Gemma-2-2B模型在MBPP代码生成和诗歌生成任务上的分析。

Result: 发现规划行为并非普遍存在：Gemma-2-2B在诗歌生成任务中采用即兴生成，在MBPP任务中在相似任务甚至连续token预测间切换规划与即兴模式。

Conclusion: 指令微调会优化基座模型已有的规划行为而非从头创建，为LLM规划机制的机理研究提供了可复现和可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
across a wide range of multi-step reasoning tasks. Recent work suggests that
LLMs may perform planning - selecting a future target token in advance and
generating intermediate tokens that lead towards it - rather than merely
improvising one token at a time. However, existing studies assume fixed
planning horizons and often focus on single prompts or narrow domains. To
distinguish planning from improvisation across models and tasks, we present
formal and causally grounded criteria for detecting planning and operationalize
them as a semi-automated annotation pipeline. We apply this pipeline to both
base and instruction-tuned Gemma-2-2B models on the MBPP code generation
benchmark and a poem generation task where Claude 3.5 Haiku was previously
shown to plan. Our findings show that planning is not universal: unlike Haiku,
Gemma-2-2B solves the same poem generation task through improvisation, and on
MBPP it switches between planning and improvisation across similar tasks and
even successive token predictions. We further show that instruction tuning
refines existing planning behaviors in the base model rather than creating them
from scratch. Together, these studies provide a reproducible and scalable
foundation for mechanistic studies of planning in LLMs.

Abstract: With the increasing prevalence of multimodal content on social media,
sentiment analysis faces significant challenges in effectively processing
heterogeneous data and recognizing multi-label emotions. Existing methods often
lack effective cross-modal fusion and external knowledge integration. We
propose SentiMM, a novel multi-agent framework designed to systematically
address these challenges. SentiMM processes text and visual inputs through
specialized agents, fuses multimodal features, enriches context via knowledge
retrieval, and aggregates results for final sentiment classification. We also
introduce SentiMMD, a large-scale multimodal dataset with seven fine-grained
sentiment categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SentiMM achieves
superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, validating the
effectiveness of our structured approach.

TL;DR: S²Sent提出了一种句子表示选择机制，通过空间选择和嵌套频率选择来优化Transformer编码器中不同块的表示融合，在保持低冗余和低语义损失的同时显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于Transformer编码器和对比学习的主流句子表示学习方法通常只使用最后一层的隐藏状态，但不同Transformer块具有不同的语义感知能力，需要合理的跨块表示融合来优化。

Method: 提出S²Sent机制，在Transformer编码器下游集成参数化嵌套选择器，包括空间选择（SS）和嵌套频率选择（FS）。SS采用基于空间压缩的自门控机制获得自适应权重，FS使用不同DCT基函数替代GAP实现低语义损失的空间压缩。

Result: 大量实验表明，S²Sent在基线方法基础上实现了显著改进，仅增加可忽略的额外参数和推理延迟，同时具有高集成性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: S²Sent通过创新的跨块表示融合机制有效平衡了语义冗余和损失，为句子表示学习提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: The combination of Transformer-based encoders with contrastive learning
represents the current mainstream paradigm for sentence representation
learning. This paradigm is typically based on the hidden states of the last
Transformer block of the encoder. However, within Transformer-based encoders,
different blocks exhibit varying degrees of semantic perception ability. From
the perspective of interpretability, the semantic perception potential of
knowledge neurons is modulated by stimuli, thus rational cross-block
representation fusion is a direction worth optimizing. To balance the semantic
redundancy and loss across block fusion, we propose a sentence representation
selection mechanism S\textsuperscript{2}Sent, which integrates a parameterized
nested selector downstream of the Transformer-based encoder. This selector
performs spatial selection (SS) and nested frequency selection (FS) from a
modular perspective. The SS innovatively employs a spatial squeeze based
self-gating mechanism to obtain adaptive weights, which not only achieves
fusion with low information redundancy but also captures the dependencies
between embedding features. The nested FS replaces GAP with different DCT basis
functions to achieve spatial squeeze with low semantic loss. Extensive
experiments have demonstrated that S\textsuperscript{2}Sent achieves
significant improvements over baseline methods with negligible additional
parameters and inference latency, while highlighting high integrability and
scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型主要作为被动响应工具，存在"意识差距"，无法在动态人类讨论中成为真正的协作伙伴，限制了其作为主动对话参与者的潜力。

Method: 采用可扩展的两阶段数据生成流程，合成大规模多轮人类讨论数据集，标注五种干预类型和明确的对话触发点。训练模型预测特殊沉默标记来学习何时保持安静，探索端到端模型和解耦分类器-生成器系统两种架构。

Result: 开发了能够准确判断发言时机并生成有用响应的模型，为更具情境意识和主动性的对话AI铺平了道路。

Conclusion: DiscussLLM框架成功解决了LLM的被动性问题，通过训练模型学习何时干预，实现了从被动响应到主动协作的转变，为构建更智能的对话系统提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
understanding and generating human-like text, yet they largely operate as
reactive agents, responding only when directly prompted. This passivity creates
an "awareness gap," limiting their potential as truly collaborative partners in
dynamic human discussions. We introduce $\textit{DiscussLLM}$, a framework
designed to bridge this gap by training models to proactively decide not just
$\textit{what}$ to say, but critically, $\textit{when}$ to speak. Our primary
contribution is a scalable two-stage data generation pipeline that synthesizes
a large-scale dataset of realistic multi-turn human discussions. Each
discussion is annotated with one of five intervention types (e.g., Factual
Correction, Concept Definition) and contains an explicit conversational trigger
where an AI intervention adds value. By training models to predict a special
silent token when no intervention is needed, they learn to remain quiet until a
helpful contribution can be made. We explore two architectural baselines: an
integrated end-to-end model and a decoupled classifier-generator system
optimized for low-latency inference. We evaluate these models on their ability
to accurately time interventions and generate helpful responses, paving the way
for more situationally aware and proactive conversational AI.

Conclusion: JSA-RAG为解决RAG模型端到端训练中的离散隐变量优化问题提供了有效方案，具有优异的性能和稳定性

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely recognized paradigm
to combine parametric memory with non-parametric memories. An RAG model
consists of two serial connecting components (retriever and generator). A major
challenge in end-to-end optimization of the RAG model is that marginalization
over relevant passages (modeled as discrete latent variables) from a knowledge
base is required. Traditional top-K marginalization and variational RAG (VRAG)
suffer from biased or high-variance gradient estimates. In this paper, we
propose and develop joint stochastic approximation (JSA) based end-to-end
training of RAG, which is referred to as JSA-RAG. The JSA algorithm is a
stochastic extension of the EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm and is
particularly powerful in estimating discrete latent variable models. Extensive
experiments are conducted on five datasets for two tasks (open-domain question
answering, knowledge-grounded dialogs) and show that JSA-RAG significantly
outperforms both vanilla RAG and VRAG. Further analysis shows the efficacy of
JSA-RAG from the perspectives of generation, retrieval, and low-variance
gradient estimate.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AulSign是一种利用大语言模型进行手语翻译的新方法，通过动态提示和上下文学习来解决手语翻译数据稀缺的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言到手语的翻译任务复杂且研究不足，现有方法在数据稀缺环境下泛化能力差，缺乏标准化的平行语料库

Method: 利用大语言模型通过动态提示和上下文学习，结合样本选择和后续符号关联，将手语符号与自然语言描述关联

Result: 在英语和意大利语上使用SignBank+和LaCAM CNR-ISTC数据集评估，在低数据场景下表现出优于最先进模型的性能

Conclusion: AulSign方法有效，有潜力增强通信技术对代表性不足语言群体的可访问性和包容性

Abstract: Translating natural languages into sign languages is a highly complex and
underexplored task. Despite growing interest in accessibility and inclusivity,
the development of robust translation systems remains hindered by the limited
availability of parallel corpora which align natural language with sign
language data. Existing methods often struggle to generalize in these
data-scarce environments, as the few datasets available are typically
domain-specific, lack standardization, or fail to capture the full linguistic
richness of sign languages. To address this limitation, we propose Advanced Use
of LLMs for Sign Language Translation (AulSign), a novel method that leverages
Large Language Models via dynamic prompting and in-context learning with sample
selection and subsequent sign association. Despite their impressive abilities
in processing text, LLMs lack intrinsic knowledge of sign languages; therefore,
they are unable to natively perform this kind of translation. To overcome this
limitation, we associate the signs with compact descriptions in natural
language and instruct the model to use them. We evaluate our method on both
English and Italian languages using SignBank+, a recognized benchmark in the
field, as well as the Italian LaCAM CNR-ISTC dataset. We demonstrate superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art models in low-data scenario. Our
findings demonstrate the effectiveness of AulSign, with the potential to
enhance accessibility and inclusivity in communication technologies for
underrepresented linguistic communities.

TL;DR: 通过语言分析识别个人音乐偏好，基于大五人格特质作为中介变量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音乐偏好与个人身份识相关，而人格特质可通过语言分析检测，研究尝试通过语言来识别个人的音乐偏好

Method: 使用过500,000个文本样本（来自5,000余名作者）的数据集，建立高级模型评估人格特征，分析五种音乐流派的粉丝群体

Result: 发现不同音乐流派粉丝在大五人格特质上存在显著差异

Conclusion: 证明了通过语言分析可以识别个人音乐偏好，为计算语言学、音乐心理学和人格分析的交叉研究提供了资源

Abstract: Music serves as a powerful reflection of individual identity, often aligning
with deeper psychological traits. Prior research has established correlations
between musical preferences and personality traits, while separate studies have
demonstrated that personality is detectable through linguistic analysis. Our
study bridges these two research domains by investigating whether individuals'
musical preferences are recognizable in their spontaneous language through the
lens of the Big Five personality traits (Openness, Conscientiousness,
Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism). Using a carefully curated
dataset of over 500,000 text samples from nearly 5,000 authors with reliably
identified musical preferences, we build advanced models to assess personality
characteristics. Our results reveal significant personality differences across
fans of five musical genres. We release resources for future research at the
intersection of computational linguistics, music psychology and personality
analysis.

*Rishikesh Devanathan,Varun Nathan,Ayush Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种用于联络中心领域合成对话生成的诊断框架，利用现有监督信号生成合成转录本，并通过18个语言和行为指标评估质量，发现现有方法在流畅性、情感和行为真实性方面存在显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联络中心对话具有目标导向、角色不对称和行为复杂性等特点，但由于隐私和数据稀缺问题，难以获得足够的真实转录本进行模型训练和评估。现有方法主要针对开放领域或医疗对话，无法满足联络中心的特殊需求。

Method: 利用联络中心现有的监督信号（如意图摘要、话题流程、QA评估表）指导生成，提出了包含18个语言和行为指标的诊断框架，比较了四种语言无关的生成策略，从简单提示到多阶段特征感知方法。

Result: 结果显示所有方法都存在持续挑战，没有一种方法在所有特征上都表现优异，特别是在流畅性、情感和行为真实性方面存在显著缺陷。诊断工具能够暴露这些差距，支持细粒度评估和多语言压力测试。

Conclusion: 联络中心合成对话生成仍面临重大挑战，需要更先进的生成方法来处理该领域的独特复杂性。提出的诊断框架为评估和改进合成对话质量提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Synthetic transcript generation is critical in contact center domains, where
privacy and data scarcity limit model training and evaluation. Unlike prior
synthetic dialogue generation work on open-domain or medical dialogues, contact
center conversations are goal-oriented, role-asymmetric, and behaviorally
complex, featuring disfluencies, ASR noise, and compliance-driven agent
actions. In deployments where transcripts are unavailable, standard pipelines
still yield derived call attributes such as Intent Summaries, Topic Flow, and
QA Evaluation Forms. We leverage these as supervision signals to guide
generation. To assess the quality of such outputs, we introduce a diagnostic
framework of 18 linguistically and behaviorally grounded metrics for comparing
real and synthetic transcripts. We benchmark four language-agnostic generation
strategies, from simple prompting to characteristic-aware multi-stage
approaches, alongside reference-free baselines. Results reveal persistent
challenges: no method excels across all traits, with notable deficits in
disfluency, sentiment, and behavioral realism. Our diagnostic tool exposes
these gaps, enabling fine-grained evaluation and stress testing of synthetic
dialogue across languages.

*Meiling Ning,Zhongbao Zhang,Junda Ye,Jiabao Guo,Qingyuan Guan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出ESFP-RM奖励模型框架，通过将AI反馈强化学习中的奖励建模重新定义为自然语言推理任务，利用带上下文解释的掩码语言模型显著提升奖励信号的稳定性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于生成式奖励模型的AI反馈强化学习(RLAIF)虽然高效可扩展，但奖励信号的稳定性和泛化性仍有提升空间。研究发现奖励建模与自然语言推理(NLI)存在形式一致性，这为构建更优奖励模型提供了新思路。

Method: 提出两阶段ESFP-RM框架：首先将奖励建模重新定义为NLI任务，然后利用带上下文解释的掩码语言模型(MLMs)进行槽位预测，充分发挥MLMs在理解边界扩展方面的优势。

Result: 在NLI任务上的探索性实验显示，带上下文解释的MLMs性能显著优于主流自回归模型。在RLHF和OOD场景的广泛实验中，ESFP-RM框架相比生成式奖励模型能提供更稳定和可泛化的奖励信号。

Conclusion: 通过将奖励建模形式化为NLI任务并利用MLMs的优势，ESFP-RM框架成功提升了奖励模型的理解能力和泛化性能，为AI反馈强化学习提供了更可靠的奖励信号来源。

Abstract: The emergence of LM-based judging reward modeling, represented by generative
reward models, has successfully made reinforcement learning from AI feedback
(RLAIF) efficient and scalable. To further advance this paradigm, we propose a
core insight: this form of reward modeling shares fundamental formal
consistency with natural language inference (NLI), a core task in natural
language understanding. This reframed perspective points to a key path for
building superior reward models: scaling the model's comprehension boundaries.
Pursuing this path, exploratory experiments on NLI tasks demonstrate that the
slot prediction masked language models (MLMs) incorporating contextual
explanations achieve significantly better performance compared to mainstream
autoregressive models. Based on this key finding, we propose ESFP-RM, a
two-stage LM-based judging reward model that utilizes an explanation based slot
framework for prediction to fully leverage the advantages of MLMs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that in both reinforcement learning from human feedback
(RLHF) and out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, the ESFP-RM framework delivers
more stable and generalizable reward signals compared to generative reward
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MTalk-Bench多轮语音对话评测基准，涵盖语义信息、副语言信息和环境声音三个维度，采用竞技场式和评分标准式双重评估方法，发现当前语音模型在副语言和环境声音处理方面存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音到语音大模型的评估框架不足以评估复杂多轮对话的性能，需要更全面的评测标准来推动该领域发展。

Method: 构建MTalk-Bench基准，包含三个核心维度和九个现实场景，采用竞技场式评估（成对比较）和评分标准式评估（绝对评分）的双重方法，结合人工和LLM评估。

Result: 模型在语义信息处理表现优秀，但在副语言信息和环境声音感知方面表现不佳；模型通过增加响应长度来恢复连贯性但牺牲效率；模态感知的任务特定设计优于简单扩展规模。评估方法方面，两种评估结果一致且互补，但仅在性能差距大时才能可靠区分；LLM评估在差距明显或标准明确时与人工一致，但存在位置和长度偏差。

Conclusion: 当前S2S评估存在局限性，需要更鲁棒、语音感知的评估框架来推动语音对话系统的发展。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech-to-speech (S2S) large language models (LLMs)
has significantly improved real-time spoken interaction. However, current
evaluation frameworks remain inadequate for assessing performance in complex,
multi-turn dialogues. To address this, we introduce MTalk-Bench, a multi-turn
S2S benchmark covering three core dimensions: Semantic Information,
Paralinguistic Information, and Ambient Sound. Each dimension includes nine
realistic scenarios, along with targeted tasks to assess specific capabilities
such as reasoning. Our dual-method evaluation framework combines Arena-style
evaluation (pairwise comparison) and Rubrics-based evaluation (absolute
scoring) for relative and absolute assessment. The benchmark includes both
model and human outputs, evaluated by human evaluators and LLMs. Experimental
results reveal two sets of findings. Overall performance of S2S LLMs: (1)
models excel at semantic information processing yet underperform on
paralinguistic information and ambient sounds perception; (2) models typically
regain coherence by increasing response length, sacrificing efficiency in
multi-turn dialogues; (3) modality-aware, task-specific designs outperform
brute scaling. Evaluation framework and reliability: (1) Arena and Rubrics
yield consistent, complementary rankings, but reliable distinctions emerge only
when performance gaps are large; (2) LLM-as-a-judge aligns with humans when
gaps are clear or criteria explicit, but exhibits position and length biases
and is reliable on nonverbal evaluation only with text annotations. These
results highlight current limitations in S2S evaluation and the need for more
robust, speech-aware assessment frameworks.

*Judith Tavarez-Rodríguez,Fernando Sánchez-Vega,A. Pastor López-Monroy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探索不同大语言模型在检测社交媒体性别歧视内容方面的能力，发现虽然LLMs能一定程度上检测性别歧视，但无法准确反映不同人口群体的多样性认知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs已被证明可用于自动检测性别歧视，但这些模型存在偏见，特别是对少数群体的偏见，且性别歧视检测任务因其主观性和自动化模型中的偏见而仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 使用EXIST 2024推文数据集，评估不同LLMs检测性别歧视的能力，该数据集包含每条推文的六种不同人口特征的标注，分析模型的人口统计偏见并进行统计分析，确定哪些人口特征（年龄、性别）对此任务最有效。

Result: 结果显示，LLMs在考虑人群总体意见时能在一定程度上检测性别歧视，但无法准确复制不同人口群体认知的多样性。

Conclusion: 这凸显了需要更好校准的模型，以考虑不同人群视角的多样性。

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) has proven to be a tool that could
help in the automatic detection of sexism. Previous studies have shown that
these models contain biases that do not accurately reflect reality, especially
for minority groups. Despite various efforts to improve the detection of sexist
content, this task remains a significant challenge due to its subjective nature
and the biases present in automated models. We explore the capabilities of
different LLMs to detect sexism in social media text using the EXIST 2024 tweet
dataset. It includes annotations from six distinct profiles for each tweet,
allowing us to evaluate to what extent LLMs can mimic these groups' perceptions
in sexism detection. Additionally, we analyze the demographic biases present in
the models and conduct a statistical analysis to identify which demographic
characteristics (age, gender) contribute most effectively to this task. Our
results show that, while LLMs can to some extent detect sexism when considering
the overall opinion of populations, they do not accurately replicate the
diversity of perceptions among different demographic groups. This highlights
the need for better-calibrated models that account for the diversity of
perspectives across different populations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估大型语言模型对中文量词预测能力的研究，发现LLMs表现不如BERT模型，双向注意力机制在量词预测中具有优势


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中文量词是汉语的重要特征，正确预测量词对教育应用至关重要，但大型语言模型是否具备正确的中文量词知识尚未在NLP文献中得到充分探索

Method: 采用多种掩码策略评估LLMs的内在能力，分析不同句子元素的贡献，研究注意力机制在预测过程中的作用，并探索通过微调提升量词性能

Result: 研究发现大型语言模型的表现不如BERT，即使经过微调也是如此。预测结果高度依赖于后续名词信息，这解释了具有双向注意力机制的模型（如BERT）的优势

Conclusion: 双向注意力机制在中文量词预测任务中具有显著优势，BERT模型在此任务上优于当前的大型语言模型

Abstract: Classifiers are an important and defining feature of the Chinese language,
and their correct prediction is key to numerous educational applications. Yet,
whether the most popular Large Language Models (LLMs) possess proper knowledge
the Chinese classifiers is an issue that has largely remain unexplored in the
Natural Language Processing (NLP) literature.
  To address such a question, we employ various masking strategies to evaluate
the LLMs' intrinsic ability, the contribution of different sentence elements,
and the working of the attention mechanisms during prediction. Besides, we
explore fine-tuning for LLMs to enhance the classifier performance.
  Our findings reveal that LLMs perform worse than BERT, even with fine-tuning.
The prediction, as expected, greatly benefits from the information about the
following noun, which also explains the advantage of models with a
bidirectional attention mechanism such as BERT.

TL;DR: MIRAGE是一个基于知识图谱的多链推理框架，通过并行推理链和交叉验证提升医疗问答的准确性和可解释性，在多个基准测试中优于GPT-4o和其他基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如search-o1使用单一线性推理链和平面的文本检索方式，在医疗问答任务中容易导致错误累积，无法满足准确性和可追溯性的关键需求。

Method: 1) 将复杂查询分解为基于实体的子问题；2) 执行并行推理链；3) 通过邻居扩展和多跳遍历自适应检索证据；4) 使用交叉链验证整合答案解决矛盾

Result: 在三个医疗QA基准测试（GenMedGPT-5k、CMCQA和ExplainCPE）上，MIRAGE在自动和人工评估中 consistently 优于GPT-4o、Tree-of-Thought变体和其他检索增强基线方法

Conclusion: MIRAGE通过结构化知识图谱上的动态多链推理，显著提升了医疗推理的准确性和可解释性，特别适合复杂的医疗推理场景，代码将开源供进一步研究

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown significant progress in test-time
scaling through chain-of-thought prompting. Current approaches like search-o1
integrate retrieval augmented generation (RAG) into multi-step reasoning
processes but rely on a single, linear reasoning chain while incorporating
unstructured textual information in a flat, context-agnostic manner. As a
result, these approaches can lead to error accumulation throughout the
reasoning chain, which significantly limits its effectiveness in medical
question-answering (QA) tasks where both accuracy and traceability are critical
requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MIRAGE (Multi-chain
Inference with Retrieval-Augmented Graph Exploration), a novel test-time
scalable reasoning framework that performs dynamic multi-chain inference over
structured medical knowledge graphs. Specifically, MIRAGE 1) decomposes complex
queries into entity-grounded sub-questions, 2) executes parallel inference
chains, 3) retrieves evidence adaptively via neighbor expansion and multi-hop
traversal, and 4) integrates answers using cross-chain verification to resolve
contradictions. Experiments on three medical QA benchmarks (GenMedGPT-5k,
CMCQA, and ExplainCPE) show that MIRAGE consistently outperforms GPT-4o,
Tree-of-Thought variants, and other retrieval-augmented baselines in both
automatic and human evaluations. Additionally, MIRAGE improves interpretability
by generating explicit reasoning chains that trace each factual claim to
concrete chains within the knowledge graph, making it well-suited for complex
medical reasoning scenarios. The code will be available for further research.

Abstract: Accurate 3D geometry acquisition is essential for a wide range of
applications, such as computer graphics, autonomous driving, robotics, and
augmented reality. However, raw point clouds acquired in real-world
environments are often corrupted with noise due to various factors such as
sensor, lighting, material, environment etc, which reduces geometric fidelity
and degrades downstream performance. Point cloud denoising is a fundamental
problem, aiming to recover clean point sets while preserving underlying
structures. Classical optimization-based methods, guided by hand-crafted
filters or geometric priors, have been extensively studied but struggle to
handle diverse and complex noise patterns. Recent deep learning approaches
leverage neural network architectures to learn distinctive representations and
demonstrate strong outcomes, particularly on complex and large-scale point
clouds. Provided these significant advances, this survey provides a
comprehensive and up-to-date review of deep learning-based point cloud
denoising methods up to August 2025. We organize the literature from two
perspectives: (1) supervision level (supervised vs. unsupervised), and (2)
modeling perspective, proposing a functional taxonomy that unifies diverse
approaches by their denoising principles. We further analyze architectural
trends both structurally and chronologically, establish a unified benchmark
with consistent training settings, and evaluate methods in terms of denoising
quality, surface fidelity, point distribution, and computational efficiency.
Finally, we discuss open challenges and outline directions for future research
in this rapidly evolving field.

Abstract: Generating coherent and diverse human dances from music signals has gained
tremendous progress in animating virtual avatars. While existing methods
support direct dance synthesis, they fail to recognize that enabling users to
edit dance movements is far more practical in real-world choreography
scenarios. Moreover, the lack of high-quality dance datasets incorporating
iterative editing also limits addressing this challenge. To achieve this goal,
we first construct DanceRemix, a large-scale multi-turn editable dance dataset
comprising the prompt featuring over 25.3M dance frames and 84.5K pairs. In
addition, we propose a novel framework for iterative and editable dance
generation coherently aligned with given music signals, namely DanceEditor.
Considering the dance motion should be both musical rhythmic and enable
iterative editing by user descriptions, our framework is built upon a
prediction-then-editing paradigm unifying multi-modal conditions. At the
initial prediction stage, our framework improves the authority of generated
results by directly modeling dance movements from tailored, aligned music.
Moreover, at the subsequent iterative editing stages, we incorporate text
descriptions as conditioning information to draw the editable results through a
specifically designed Cross-modality Editing Module (CEM). Specifically, CEM
adaptively integrates the initial prediction with music and text prompts as
temporal motion cues to guide the synthesized sequences. Thereby, the results
display music harmonics while preserving fine-grained semantic alignment with
text descriptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art models on our newly collected DanceRemix
dataset. Code is available at https://lzvsdy.github.io/DanceEditor/.

Abstract: Holographic near-eye displays offer ultra-compact form factors for virtual
and augmented reality systems, but rely on advanced computer-generated
holography (CGH) algorithms to convert 3D scenes into interference patterns
that can be displayed on spatial light modulators (SLMs). Gaussian Wave
Splatting (GWS) has recently emerged as a powerful CGH paradigm that allows for
the conversion of Gaussians, a state-of-the-art neural 3D representation, into
holograms. However, GWS assumes smooth-phase distributions over the Gaussian
primitives, limiting their ability to model view-dependent effects and
reconstruct accurate defocus blur, and severely under-utilizing the
space-bandwidth product of the SLM. In this work, we propose random-phase GWS
(GWS-RP) to improve bandwidth utilization, which has the effect of increasing
eyebox size, reconstructing accurate defocus blur and parallax, and supporting
time-multiplexed rendering to suppress speckle artifacts.
  At the core of GWS-RP are (1) a fundamentally new wavefront compositing
procedure and (2) an alpha-blending scheme specifically designed for
random-phase Gaussian primitives, ensuring physically correct color
reconstruction and robust occlusion handling. Additionally, we present the
first formally derived algorithm for applying random phase to Gaussian
primitives, grounded in rigorous statistical optics analysis and validated
through practical near-eye display applications. Through extensive simulations
and experimental validations, we demonstrate that these advancements,
collectively with time-multiplexing, uniquely enables full-bandwith light field
CGH that supports accurate accurate parallax and defocus, yielding
state-of-the-art image quality and perceptually faithful 3D holograms for
next-generation near-eye displays.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于参考的草图着色新框架，通过分解着色过程和使用不同的参考表示来解决训练与推理时的空间不对齐问题，显著提升着色质量和参考相似度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 通过广泛的定性和定量评估以及用户研究，证明该方法在视觉质量和参考相似度方面优于现有方法，并提供灵活的推理模式适应多种使用场景。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了参考与草图不对齐导致的着色质量问题，通过模块化设计和不同的参考表示优化了着色过程的不同方面，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Reference-based sketch colorization methods have garnered significant
attention for the potential application in animation and digital illustration
production. However, most existing methods are trained with image triplets of
sketch, reference, and ground truth that are semantically and spatially
similar, while real-world references and sketches often exhibit substantial
misalignment. This mismatch in data distribution between training and inference
leads to overfitting, consequently resulting in artifacts and signif- icant
quality degradation in colorization results. To address this issue, we conduct
an in-depth analysis of the reference representations, defined as the
intermedium to transfer information from reference to sketch. Building on this
analysis, we introduce a novel framework that leverages distinct reference
representations to optimize different aspects of the colorization process. Our
approach decomposes colorization into modular stages, al- lowing
region-specific reference injection to enhance visual quality and reference
similarity while mitigating spatial artifacts. Specifically, we first train a
backbone network guided by high-level semantic embeddings. We then introduce a
background encoder and a style encoder, trained in separate stages, to enhance
low-level feature transfer and improve reference similar- ity. This design also
enables flexible inference modes suited for a variety of use cases. Extensive
qualitative and quantitative evaluations, together with a user study,
demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method compared to
existing approaches. Code and pre-trained weight will be made publicly
available upon paper acceptance.

*Xiaoyang Huang,Bingbing Ni,Wenjun Zhang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种将AI生成的3D内容与参数化设计工具连接的方法，通过可微分建模操作和分层图优化，生成与设计师工作流程兼容的设计操作序列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI生成内容与人类设计范式之间的表示不兼容问题，传统AI框架主要处理网格或神经表示，而设计师使用参数化建模工具，这种脱节降低了AI在3D行业中的实用价值。

Method: 将基本建模操作（如挤出、布尔运算）重新表述为可微分单元，通过基于梯度的学习联合优化连续和离散参数。构建具有门控机制的分层图，通过最小化到目标几何的Chamfer距离进行端到端优化。使用多阶段序列长度约束和领域规则惩罚实现无监督学习。

Result: 生成的操作序列实现了高几何保真度、平滑网格布线、合理的步骤组成和灵活的编辑能力，完全兼容设计行业标准。

Conclusion: 该方法成功弥合了AI生成内容与人类设计工作流程之间的差距，为3D行业提供了实用的人机协作解决方案，生成的参数化设计序列可以直接在现代3D软件中使用。

Abstract: The emergence of 3D artificial intelligence-generated content (3D-AIGC) has
enabled rapid synthesis of intricate geometries. However, a fundamental
disconnect persists between AI-generated content and human-centric design
paradigms, rooted in representational incompatibilities: conventional AI
frameworks predominantly manipulate meshes or neural representations
(\emph{e.g.}, NeRF, Gaussian Splatting), while designers operate within
parametric modeling tools. This disconnection diminishes the practical value of
AI for 3D industry, undermining the efficiency of human-AI collaboration. To
resolve this disparity, we focus on generating design operation sequences,
which are structured modeling histories that comprehensively capture the
step-by-step construction process of 3D assets and align with designers'
typical workflows in modern 3D software. We first reformulate fundamental
modeling operations (\emph{e.g.}, \emph{Extrude}, \emph{Boolean}) into
differentiable units, enabling joint optimization of continuous (\emph{e.g.},
\emph{Extrude} height) and discrete (\emph{e.g.}, \emph{Boolean} type)
parameters via gradient-based learning. Based on these differentiable
operations, a hierarchical graph with gating mechanism is constructed and
optimized end-to-end by minimizing Chamfer Distance to target geometries.
Multi-stage sequence length constraint and domain rule penalties enable
unsupervised learning of compact design sequences without ground-truth sequence
supervision. Extensive validation demonstrates that the generated operation
sequences achieve high geometric fidelity, smooth mesh wiring, rational step
composition and flexible editing capacity, with full compatibility within
design industry.

Motivation: 现有表面重建方法在输入视图极其稀疏时难以恢复准确的场景几何形状，需要解决稀疏视图下的几何重建问题。

Method: 使用前馈网络预测每视图像素对齐的2D高斯溅射，通过加权Chamfer距离损失正则化深度图，并引入法线预测网络对齐高斯溅射方向与单目法线估计器预测的法向量。

Result: 大量实验验证了所提改进的有效性，在可泛化稀疏视图网格重建任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MeshSplat通过创新的2D高斯溅射框架成功解决了稀疏视图下的表面重建挑战，为计算机视觉和图形学领域的几何重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Surface reconstruction has been widely studied in computer vision and
graphics. However, existing surface reconstruction works struggle to recover
accurate scene geometry when the input views are extremely sparse. To address
this issue, we propose MeshSplat, a generalizable sparse-view surface
reconstruction framework via Gaussian Splatting. Our key idea is to leverage
2DGS as a bridge, which connects novel view synthesis to learned geometric
priors and then transfers these priors to achieve surface reconstruction.
Specifically, we incorporate a feed-forward network to predict per-view
pixel-aligned 2DGS, which enables the network to synthesize novel view images
and thus eliminates the need for direct 3D ground-truth supervision. To improve
the accuracy of 2DGS position and orientation prediction, we propose a Weighted
Chamfer Distance Loss to regularize the depth maps, especially in overlapping
areas of input views, and also a normal prediction network to align the
orientation of 2DGS with normal vectors predicted by a monocular normal
estimator. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed
improvement, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance in generalizable sparse-view mesh reconstruction tasks. Project

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种增强的基于规则的结巴检测框架，在保持完全可解释性的同时实现了竞争性性能，特别在延长音检测方面表现优异（97-99%准确率），并展示了如何将可解释模型与现代机器学习流程集成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度学习在自动语音障碍检测方面取得了进展，但在临床应用中，可解释性和透明度至关重要，基于规则的方法仍然不可或缺。

Method: 提出了增强的基于规则框架，包含说话速率标准化、多级声学特征分析和分层决策结构，综合分析了UCLASS、FluencyBank和SEP-28k等多个语料库。

Result: 在延长音检测方面达到97-99%的准确率，在不同说话速率下提供稳定性能，虽然神经网络在无约束设置下可能获得略高的准确率，但基于规则的方法在临床环境中具有独特优势。

Conclusion: 基于规则的系统在临床环境中具有决策可审计性、患者特定调优和实时反馈等独特优势，可以作为提案生成器或约束模块与现代AI系统集成，弥合传统言语病理学实践与当代AI系统之间的差距。

Abstract: Stuttering affects approximately 1% of the global population, impacting
communication and quality of life. While recent advances in deep learning have
pushed the boundaries of automatic speech dysfluency detection, rule-based
approaches remain crucial for clinical applications where interpretability and
transparency are paramount. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of
rule-based stuttering detection systems, synthesizing insights from multiple
corpora including UCLASS, FluencyBank, and SEP-28k. We propose an enhanced
rule-based framework that incorporates speaking-rate normalization, multi-level
acoustic feature analysis, and hierarchical decision structures. Our approach
achieves competitive performance while maintaining complete
interpretability-critical for clinical adoption. We demonstrate that rule-based
systems excel particularly in prolongation detection (97-99% accuracy) and
provide stable performance across varying speaking rates. Furthermore, we show
how these interpretable models can be integrated with modern machine learning
pipelines as proposal generators or constraint modules, bridging the gap
between traditional speech pathology practices and contemporary AI systems. Our
analysis reveals that while neural approaches may achieve marginally higher
accuracy in unconstrained settings, rule-based methods offer unique advantages
in clinical contexts where decision auditability, patient-specific tuning, and
real-time feedback are essential.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解影响学生数学表现的因素对设计有效教育政策至关重要，需要通过可解释的AI技术来识别关键预测因素

Method: 使用PISA 2018数据（67,329名学生），测试四种模型：多元线性回归、随机森林、CATBoost和人工神经网络，采用特征重要性、SHAP值和决策树可视化确保可解释性

Result: 非线性模型（特别是随机森林和ANN）表现超过线性回归，随机森林在准确性和普适性方面取得最佳平衡，关键预测因素在不同国家存在差异

Conclusion: 研究强调了成绩的非线性和上下文依赖性，展示了XAI在教育研究中的价值，为政策改革和个性化学习策略提供支持

Abstract: Understanding the factors that shape students' mathematics performance is
vital for designing effective educational policies. This study applies
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to PISA 2018 data to
predict math achievement and identify key predictors across ten countries
(67,329 students). We tested four models: Multiple Linear Regression (MLR),
Random Forest (RF), CATBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), using
student, family, and school variables. Models were trained on 70% of the data
(with 5-fold cross-validation) and tested on 30%, stratified by country.
Performance was assessed with R^2 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). To ensure
interpretability, we used feature importance, SHAP values, and decision tree
visualizations. Non-linear models, especially RF and ANN, outperformed MLR,
with RF balancing accuracy and generalizability. Key predictors included
socio-economic status, study time, teacher motivation, and students' attitudes
toward mathematics, though their impact varied across countries. Visual
diagnostics such as scatterplots of predicted vs actual scores showed RF and
CATBoost aligned closely with actual performance. Findings highlight the
non-linear and context-dependent nature of achievement and the value of XAI in
educational research. This study uncovers cross-national patterns, informs
equity-focused reforms, and supports the development of personalized learning
strategies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文对ICD编码模型的解释性进行了系统评估，提出了基于忠实度和合理性的双重评估框架，构建了新的标注数据集，并利用LLM生成解释来提升模型解释质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习模型在ICD编码方面取得了显著进展，但缺乏可解释性，影响了临床应用的信任度和透明度。现有方法主要依赖注意力机制和医生定性评估，缺乏系统性评估和专门训练生成解释的方法。

Method: 1) 从忠实度（反映模型真实推理）和合理性（与专家判断一致性）两个维度评估解释性；2) 构建新的高质量标注数据集；3) 提出基于LLM生成解释的远程监督学习方法，使用带/不带标注示例的提示来生成监督信号。

Result: LLM生成的解释与人类专家判断最为接近。加入少量人工标注示例不仅能进一步提升解释生成质量，还能增强基于解释的学习方法的效果。

Conclusion: 本研究为ICD编码模型的解释性提供了系统性评估框架，证明了LLM生成解释的有效性，并为提升临床编码模型的透明度和可信度提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Automated clinical coding involves mapping unstructured text from Electronic
Health Records (EHRs) to standardized code systems such as the International
Classification of Diseases (ICD). While recent advances in deep learning have
significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of ICD coding, the lack of
explainability in these models remains a major limitation, undermining trust
and transparency. Current explorations about explainability largely rely on
attention-based techniques and qualitative assessments by physicians, yet lack
systematic evaluation using consistent criteria on high-quality rationale
datasets, as well as dedicated approaches explicitly trained to generate
rationales for further enhancing explanation. In this work, we conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of the explainability of the rationales for ICD coding
through two key lenses: faithfulness that evaluates how well explanations
reflect the model's actual reasoning and plausibility that measures how
consistent the explanations are with human expert judgment. To facilitate the
evaluation of plausibility, we construct a new rationale-annotated dataset,
offering denser annotations with diverse granularity and aligns better with
current clinical practice, and conduct evaluation across three types of
rationales of ICD coding. Encouraged by the promising plausibility of
LLM-generated rationales for ICD coding, we further propose new rationale
learning methods to improve the quality of model-generated rationales, where
rationales produced by prompting LLMs with/without annotation examples are used
as distant supervision signals. We empirically find that LLM-generated
rationales align most closely with those of human experts. Moreover,
incorporating few-shot human-annotated examples not only further improves
rationale generation but also enhances rationale-learning approaches.

Motivation: 现有GPU加速学习环境通常提供固定游戏的硬编码实现，缺乏灵活性。PuzzleJAX旨在支持动态编译任意游戏，覆盖更广泛、更具表达力的人类相关任务空间。

Method: 基于流行的PuzzleScript在线游戏引擎设计领域特定语言(DSL)，在PuzzleJAX中验证了数百个自2013年以来设计的游戏，展示其对广泛、表达力强且人类相关任务空间的覆盖能力。

Result: PuzzleJAX能够自然表达既简单直观又极具挑战性的任务，需要控制、规划和高层次洞察力的结合。通过分析搜索、学习和语言模型在这些游戏上的表现，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: PuzzleJAX提供了一个强大的GPU加速平台，支持对AI算法在复杂益智游戏上的性能进行大规模基准测试，填补了现有环境的灵活性不足问题。

Abstract: We introduce PuzzleJAX, a GPU-accelerated puzzle game engine and description
language designed to support rapid benchmarking of tree search, reinforcement
learning, and LLM reasoning abilities. Unlike existing GPU-accelerated learning
environments that provide hard-coded implementations of fixed sets of games,
PuzzleJAX allows dynamic compilation of any game expressible in its
domain-specific language (DSL). This DSL follows PuzzleScript, which is a
popular and accessible online game engine for designing puzzle games. In this
paper, we validate in PuzzleJAX several hundred of the thousands of games
designed in PuzzleScript by both professional designers and casual creators
since its release in 2013, thereby demonstrating PuzzleJAX's coverage of an
expansive, expressive, and human-relevant space of tasks. By analyzing the
performance of search, learning, and language models on these games, we show
that PuzzleJAX can naturally express tasks that are both simple and intuitive
to understand, yet often deeply challenging to master, requiring a combination
of control, planning, and high-level insight.

TL;DR: 提出一个医疗优先的框架，使用单一视觉语言模型(VLM)同时承担模型路由和专科任务处理的双重角色，简化临床工作流程并提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床工作流程碎片化，由多个脚本和任务特定网络组成，缺乏数据驱动的模型识别和标准化输出交付，导致效率低下和运营成本增加。

Method: 采用单一VLM的两种互补方案：1)作为模型卡匹配器，通过三级工作流路由图像；2)在专科数据集上微调VLM，使单个模型覆盖多个下游任务。

Result: 在胃肠病学、血液学、眼科学和病理学等多个专科领域，单模型部署达到或接近专用基线的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法证明一个VLM既能决策又能执行，可减少数据科学家工作量、简化监控、提高模型选择透明度并降低集成开销。

Abstract: Clinical workflows are fragmented as a patchwork of scripts and task-specific
networks that often handle triage, task selection, and model deployment. These
pipelines are rarely streamlined for data science pipeline, reducing efficiency
and raising operational costs. Workflows also lack data-driven model
identification (from imaging/tabular inputs) and standardized delivery of model
outputs. In response, we present a practical, healthcare-first framework that
uses a single vision-language model (VLM) in two complementary roles. First
(Solution 1), the VLM acts as an aware model-card matcher that routes an
incoming image to the appropriate specialist model via a three-stage workflow
(modality -> primary abnormality -> model-card id). Checks are provided by (i)
stagewise prompts that allow early exit via None/Normal/Other and (ii) a
stagewise answer selector that arbitrates between the top-2 candidates at each
stage, reducing the chance of an incorrect selection and aligning the workflow
with clinical risk tolerance. Second (Solution 2), we fine-tune the VLM on
specialty-specific datasets ensuring a single model covers multiple downstream
tasks within each specialty, maintaining performance while simplifying
deployment. Across gastroenterology, hematology, ophthalmology, and pathology,
our single-model deployment matches or approaches specialized baselines.
  Compared with pipelines composed of many task-specific agents, this approach
shows that one VLM can both decide and do. It may reduce effort by data
scientists, shorten monitoring, increase the transparency of model selection
(with per-stage justifications), and lower integration overhead.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究使用贝叶斯框架量化LLM中的奉承行为，通过测量与理性行为的偏差来评估奉承性，发现LLM并非贝叶斯理性，奉承行为会导致预测后验概率显著偏向用户观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常通过行为变化或准确性影响来量化奉承性，但这些方法无法表征理性变化，且准确性度量仅适用于有已知真实值的场景。需要一种能处理固有不确定性或无真实值任务的方法。

Method: 采用贝叶斯框架，将奉承性定义为面对用户观点时与理性行为的偏差。研究3个不同任务、开源和闭源LLM组合，以及两种奉承性探测方法，并实验多种概率判断提取方法。

Result: 1) LLM不是贝叶斯理性的；2) 奉承性探测导致预测后验概率显著偏向引导结果；3) 奉承性有时增加贝叶斯误差，少数情况下反而减少误差；4) 奉承性引起的贝叶斯误差变化与Brier分数相关性不强。

Conclusion: 仅研究奉承性对真实值的影响不能完全捕捉由奉承性引起的推理错误，贝叶斯框架提供了更全面的奉承性量化方法，特别适用于具有不确定性或无真实值的任务。

Abstract: Sycophancy, or overly agreeable or flattering behavior, is a documented issue
in large language models (LLMs), and is critical to understand in the context
of human/AI collaboration. Prior works typically quantify sycophancy by
measuring shifts in behavior or impacts on accuracy, but neither metric
characterizes shifts in rationality, and accuracy measures can only be used in
scenarios with a known ground truth. In this work, we utilize a Bayesian
framework to quantify sycophancy as deviations from rational behavior when
presented with user perspectives, thus distinguishing between rational and
irrational updates based on the introduction of user perspectives. In
comparison to other methods, this approach allows us to characterize excessive
behavioral shifts, even for tasks that involve inherent uncertainty or do not
have a ground truth. We study sycophancy for 3 different tasks, a combination
of open-source and closed LLMs, and two different methods for probing
sycophancy. We also experiment with multiple methods for eliciting probability
judgments from LLMs. We hypothesize that probing LLMs for sycophancy will cause
deviations in LLMs' predicted posteriors that will lead to increased Bayesian
error. Our findings indicate that: 1) LLMs are not Bayesian rational, 2)
probing for sycophancy results in significant increases to the predicted
posterior in favor of the steered outcome, 3) sycophancy sometimes results in
increased Bayesian error, and in a small number of cases actually decreases
error, and 4) changes in Bayesian error due to sycophancy are not strongly
correlated in Brier score, suggesting that studying the impact of sycophancy on
ground truth alone does not fully capture errors in reasoning due to
sycophancy.

Abstract: Data visualizations like charts are fundamental tools for quantitative
analysis and decision-making across fields, requiring accurate interpretation
and mathematical reasoning. The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) offers promising capabilities for automated visual data analysis, such
as processing charts, answering questions, and generating summaries. However,
they provide no visibility into which parts of the visual data informed their
conclusions; this black-box nature poses significant challenges to real-world
trust and adoption. In this paper, we take the first major step towards
evaluating and enhancing the capabilities of MLLMs to attribute their reasoning
process by highlighting the specific regions in charts and graphs that justify
model answers. To this end, we contribute RADAR, a semi-automatic approach to
obtain a benchmark dataset comprising 17,819 diverse samples with charts,
questions, reasoning steps, and attribution annotations. We also introduce a
method that provides attribution for chart-based mathematical reasoning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our reasoning-guided approach improves
attribution accuracy by 15% compared to baseline methods, and enhanced
attribution capabilities translate to stronger answer generation, achieving an
average BERTScore of $\sim$ 0.90, indicating high alignment with ground truth
responses. This advancement represents a significant step toward more
interpretable and trustworthy chart analysis systems, enabling users to verify
and understand model decisions through reasoning and attribution.

Motivation: 无限论证框架虽然表达能力强，但计算复杂性限制了其实际应用。研究有穷无限AFs（每个论证只被有限个其他论证攻击）的计算复杂性，旨在找到表达性和计算可处理性之间的平衡点。

Method: 通过理论分析和复杂性理论研究，分析无限但有穷论证框架中各种计算问题（特别是基于可接受性语义的问题）的计算复杂性。

Result: 发现虽然有穷性假设并不总是自动降低复杂性，但对于基于可接受性语义的问题，存在显著的组合约束导致复杂性大幅下降。

Conclusion: 有穷无限论证框架为许多推理形式提供了自然的建模环境，在保持足够表达能力的同时具有计算可处理性，使得框架内的分析具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Abstract argumentation frameworks (AFs) provide a formal setting to analyze
many forms of reasoning with conflicting information. While the expressiveness
of general infinite AFs make them a tempting tool for modeling many kinds of
reasoning scenarios, the computational intractability of solving infinite AFs
limit their use, even in many theoretical applications.
  We investigate the complexity of computational problems related to infinite
but finitary argumentations frameworks, that is, infinite AFs where each
argument is attacked by only finitely many others. Our results reveal a
surprising scenario. On one hand, we see that the assumption of being finitary
does not automatically guarantee a drop in complexity. However, for the
admissibility-based semantics, we find a remarkable combinatorial constraint
which entails a dramatic decrease in complexity.
  We conclude that for many forms of reasoning, the finitary infinite AFs
provide a natural setting for reasoning which balances well the competing goals
of being expressive enough to be applied to many reasoning settings while being
computationally tractable enough for the analysis within the framework to be
useful.

TL;DR: 提出Generate-and-Split (GaS)框架，结合强化学习和最优分割算法解决多旅行商最小最大路径问题，显著提升解质量和可迁移性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统两阶段方法将学习组件与经典求解器分离，破坏了优化一致性，可能导致解质量下降

Method: GaS框架在联合训练过程中整合强化学习和最优分割算法，采用LSTM增强模型架构处理部分可观测性

Result: 大量实验表明GaS框架在解质量和可迁移性方面显著优于现有学习方法

Conclusion: 提出的联合训练框架有效解决了传统两阶段方法的优化不一致问题，为多旅行商问题提供了高质量解决方案

Abstract: This study addresses the Min-Max Multiple Traveling Salesmen Problem
($m^3$-TSP), which aims to coordinate tours for multiple salesmen such that the
length of the longest tour is minimized. Due to its NP-hard nature, exact
solvers become impractical under the assumption that $P \ne NP$. As a result,
learning-based approaches have gained traction for their ability to rapidly
generate high-quality approximate solutions. Among these, two-stage methods
combine learning-based components with classical solvers, simplifying the
learning objective. However, this decoupling often disrupts consistent
optimization, potentially degrading solution quality. To address this issue, we
propose a novel two-stage framework named \textbf{Generate-and-Split} (GaS),
which integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with an optimal splitting
algorithm in a joint training process. The splitting algorithm offers
near-linear scalability with respect to the number of cities and guarantees
optimal splitting in Euclidean space for any given path. To facilitate the
joint optimization of the RL component with the algorithm, we adopt an
LSTM-enhanced model architecture to address partial observability. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed GaS framework significantly outperforms
existing learning-based approaches in both solution quality and
transferability.

Conclusion: 该AI系统成功解决了配电网分析自动化的挑战，为资源有限的小型电力公司提供了可扩展的高级分析能力。

Abstract: Due to the rapid pace of electrification and decarbonization, distribution
grid (DG) operation and planning are becoming more complex, necessitating
advanced computational analyses to ensure grid reliability and resilience.
State-of-the-art DG analyses rely on disparate workflows of complex models,
functions, and data pipelines, which require expert knowledge and are
challenging to automate. Many small-scale utilities and cooperatives lack a
large R&D workforce and therefore cannot use advanced analysis at scale. To
address this gap, we develop a novel agentic AI system, PowerChain, to solve
unseen DG analysis tasks via automated agentic orchestration and large language
models (LLMs) function-calling. Given a natural language query, PowerChain
dynamically generates and executes an ordered sequence of domain-aware
functions guided by the semantics of an expert-built power systems function
pool and a select reference set of known, expert-generated workflow-query
pairs. Our results show that PowerChain can produce expert-level workflows with
both GPT-5 and open-source Qwen models on complex, unseen DG analysis tasks
operating on real utility data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前'以人为中心的AI'和'基于价值的决策'研究存在不足，需要深入理解系统如何整合人类价值、人类如何识别系统价值，以及如何最小化伤害风险。

Method: 通过理论分析，提出价值对齐应超越静态单一概念，强调长期推理和适应性，并推荐使用多智能体系统框架来处理价值多元化和冲突问题。

Result: 识别了价值对齐面临的关键挑战，提出了研究方向，包括设计方法学、实际应用等多个视角的价值对齐讨论。

Conclusion: 价值对齐研究需要更全面的理论框架来应对人类价值的全谱系，多智能体系统为处理价值多元化和冲突提供了合适的框架，需要进一步推进相关研究。

Abstract: The concepts of ``human-centered AI'' and ``value-based decision'' have
gained significant attention in both research and industry. However, many
critical aspects remain underexplored and require further investigation. In
particular, there is a need to understand how systems incorporate human values,
how humans can identify these values within systems, and how to minimize the
risks of harm or unintended consequences. In this paper, we highlight the need
to rethink how we frame value alignment and assert that value alignment should
move beyond static and singular conceptions of values. We argue that AI systems
should implement long-term reasoning and remain adaptable to evolving values.
Furthermore, value alignment requires more theories to address the full
spectrum of human values. Since values often vary among individuals or groups,
multi-agent systems provide the right framework for navigating pluralism,
conflict, and inter-agent reasoning about values. We identify the challenges
associated with value alignment and indicate directions for advancing value
alignment research. In addition, we broadly discuss diverse perspectives of
value alignment, from design methodologies to practical applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MaRVL-QA是一个新的多模态大语言模型基准测试，专注于数学表面图的深度数学和空间推理能力评估，包含拓扑计数和变换识别两个任务，揭示了当前最先进模型在此类推理上的显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在语义描述方面已取得成功，但在深度数学和空间推理方面仍有待突破。数学表面图提供了一个理想的测试平台，能够从自然图像的语义噪声中隔离出纯粹的推理任务。

Method: 通过精心策划的函数库生成数学表面图，并进行严格的歧义过滤，构建了包含拓扑计数（识别和枚举局部极值等特征）和变换识别（识别几何变换）两个新颖任务的MaRVL-QA基准测试。

Result: 评估结果显示，即使是当前最先进的多模态大语言模型在此基准测试上也表现困难，往往依赖表面启发式方法而非稳健的空间推理能力。

Conclusion: MaRVL-QA为研究社区提供了一个具有挑战性的新工具，可用于衡量进展、暴露模型局限性，并指导开发具有更深层次推理能力的多模态大语言模型。

Abstract: A key frontier for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is the ability to
perform deep mathematical and spatial reasoning directly from images, moving
beyond their established success in semantic description. Mathematical surface
plots provide a rigorous testbed for this capability, as they isolate the task
of reasoning from the semantic noise common in natural images. To measure
progress on this frontier, we introduce MaRVL-QA (Mathematical Reasoning over
Visual Landscapes), a new benchmark designed to quantitatively evaluate these
core reasoning skills. The benchmark comprises two novel tasks: Topological
Counting, identifying and enumerating features like local maxima; and
Transformation Recognition, recognizing applied geometric transformations.
Generated from a curated library of functions with rigorous ambiguity
filtering, our evaluation on MaRVL-QA reveals that even state-of-the-art MLLMs
struggle significantly, often resorting to superficial heuristics instead of
robust spatial reasoning. MaRVL-QA provides a challenging new tool for the
research community to measure progress, expose model limitations, and guide the
development of MLLMs with more profound reasoning abilities.

Method: 提出四代理协作框架：Parser和Curator提取和组织内容，Layout代理设计空间布局，Stylist代理应用视觉设计元素，Renderer合成最终海报。

Result: 实验结果显示PosterGen在内容保真度上与现有方法相当，在视觉设计方面显著优于现有方法，生成的海报几乎无需人工修改即可使用。

Conclusion: 多智能体LLM框架能够有效自动化论文海报生成过程，结合专业设计流程和VLM评估标准，可以生成既语义准确又视觉吸引人的高质量海报。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built upon large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in tackling complex compositional tasks. In this work,
we apply this paradigm to the paper-to-poster generation problem, a practical
yet time-consuming process faced by researchers preparing for conferences.
While recent approaches have attempted to automate this task, most neglect core
design and aesthetic principles, resulting in posters that require substantial
manual refinement. To address these design limitations, we propose PosterGen, a
multi-agent framework that mirrors the workflow of professional poster
designers. It consists of four collaborative specialized agents: (1) Parser and
Curator agents extract content from the paper and organize storyboard; (2)
Layout agent maps the content into a coherent spatial layout; (3) Stylist
agents apply visual design elements such as color and typography; and (4)
Renderer composes the final poster. Together, these agents produce posters that
are both semantically grounded and visually appealing. To evaluate design
quality, we introduce a vision-language model (VLM)-based rubric that measures
layout balance, readability, and aesthetic coherence. Experimental results show
that PosterGen consistently matches in content fidelity, and significantly
outperforms existing methods in visual designs, generating posters that are
presentation-ready with minimal human refinements.

Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在具身智能体中缺乏结构化空间记忆，只能进行反应式操作，限制了在复杂真实环境中的泛化和适应能力。

Method: BSC-Nav从自我中心轨迹和上下文线索构建异中心认知地图，动态检索与语义目标对齐的空间知识，并与强大的多模态大语言模型集成。

Conclusion: BSC-Nav为通用空间智能提供了一个可扩展且基于生物学基础的有效路径，统一了空间认知的构建和利用框架。

Abstract: Spatial cognition enables adaptive goal-directed behavior by constructing
internal models of space. Robust biological systems consolidate spatial
knowledge into three interconnected forms: \textit{landmarks} for salient cues,
\textit{route knowledge} for movement trajectories, and \textit{survey
knowledge} for map-like representations. While recent advances in multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs) have enabled visual-language reasoning in
embodied agents, these efforts lack structured spatial memory and instead
operate reactively, limiting their generalization and adaptability in complex
real-world environments. Here we present Brain-inspired Spatial Cognition for
Navigation (BSC-Nav), a unified framework for constructing and leveraging
structured spatial memory in embodied agents. BSC-Nav builds allocentric
cognitive maps from egocentric trajectories and contextual cues, and
dynamically retrieves spatial knowledge aligned with semantic goals. Integrated
with powerful MLLMs, BSC-Nav achieves state-of-the-art efficacy and efficiency
across diverse navigation tasks, demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization,
and supports versatile embodied behaviors in the real physical world, offering
a scalable and biologically grounded path toward general-purpose spatial
intelligence.

Conclusion: 研究表明LLMs在精心设计的提示策略和多智能体协作下，能够有效促进随机优化问题的语言驱动建模，为智能建模管道的发展铺平了道路。

Abstract: This paper presents the first integrated systematic study on the performance
of large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, to automatically
formulate and solve stochastic optimiza- tion problems from natural language
descriptions. Focusing on three key categories, joint chance- constrained
models, individual chance-constrained models, and two-stage stochastic linear
programs (SLP-2), we design several prompts that guide ChatGPT through
structured tasks using chain-of- thought and modular reasoning. We introduce a
novel soft scoring metric that evaluates the struc- tural quality and partial
correctness of generated models, addressing the limitations of canonical and
execution-based accuracy. Across a diverse set of stochastic problems,
GPT-4-Turbo outperforms other models in partial score, variable matching, and
objective accuracy, with cot_s_instructions and agentic emerging as the most
effective prompting strategies. Our findings reveal that with well-engineered
prompts and multi-agent collaboration, LLMs can facilitate specially stochastic
formulations, paving the way for intelligent, language-driven modeling
pipelines in stochastic opti- mization.

(CFs) to assess the impact of specific symptom changes on antidepressant
choice. Results: Among 17 binary classifiers, Random Forest achieved highest
performance (accuracy, F1, precision, recall, ROC-AUC near 0.85). Sample-based
CFs revealed both local and global feature importance of individual symptoms in
medication selection. Conclusions: Counterfactual reasoning elucidates which
MDD symptoms most strongly drive SSRI versus SNRI selection, enhancing
interpretability of AI-based clinical decision support systems. Future work
should validate these findings on more diverse cohorts and refine algorithms
for clinical deployment.

Motivation: 临床决策支持系统需要在保证安全的前提下进行在线适应性调整，以提高疗效和减少专家干预频率。

Method: 系统使用批量约束策略初始化，通过五个Q网络集成估计不确定性，数字双胎更新患者状态，治疗效果作为奖励，并设置基于规则的安全门控制。

Conclusion: 该设计将离线策略转化为连续的、医生监督的系统，具有清晰的控制机制和快速适应能力。

Abstract: Clinical decision support must adapt online under safety constraints. We
present an online adaptive tool where reinforcement learning provides the
policy, a patient digital twin provides the environment, and treatment effect
defines the reward. The system initializes a batch-constrained policy from
retrospective data and then runs a streaming loop that selects actions, checks
safety, and queries experts only when uncertainty is high. Uncertainty comes
from a compact ensemble of five Q-networks via the coefficient of variation of
action values with a $\tanh$ compression. The digital twin updates the patient
state with a bounded residual rule. The outcome model estimates immediate
clinical effect, and the reward is the treatment effect relative to a
conservative reference with a fixed z-score normalization from the training
split. Online updates operate on recent data with short runs and exponential
moving averages. A rule-based safety gate enforces vital ranges and
contraindications before any action is applied. Experiments in a synthetic
clinical simulator show low latency, stable throughput, a low expert query rate
at fixed safety, and improved return against standard value-based baselines.
The design turns an offline policy into a continuous, clinician-supervised
system with clear controls and fast adaptation.

Result: MC3G相比现有技术提供更可解释和可操作的对抗建议，同时具有更低的成本

Conclusion: MC3G框架能够增强机器学习决策过程的透明度、问责制和实际效用，同时保护算法隐私

Abstract: Machine learning models increasingly influence decisions in high-stakes
settings such as finance, law and hiring, driving the need for transparent,
interpretable outcomes. However, while explainable approaches can help
understand the decisions being made, they may inadvertently reveal the
underlying proprietary algorithm: an undesirable outcome for many
practitioners. Consequently, it is crucial to balance meaningful transparency
with a form of recourse that clarifies why a decision was made and offers
actionable steps following which a favorable outcome can be obtained.
Counterfactual explanations offer a powerful mechanism to address this need by
showing how specific input changes lead to a more favorable prediction. We
propose Model-Agnostic Causally Constrained Counterfactual Generation (MC3G), a
novel framework that tackles limitations in the existing counterfactual
methods. First, MC3G is model-agnostic: it approximates any black-box model
using an explainable rule-based surrogate model. Second, this surrogate is used
to generate counterfactuals that produce a favourable outcome for the original
underlying black box model. Third, MC3G refines cost computation by excluding
the ``effort" associated with feature changes that occur automatically due to
causal dependencies. By focusing only on user-initiated changes, MC3G provides
a more realistic and fair representation of the effort needed to achieve a
favourable outcome. We show that MC3G delivers more interpretable and
actionable counterfactual recommendations compared to existing techniques all
while having a lower cost. Our findings highlight MC3G's potential to enhance
transparency, accountability, and practical utility in decision-making
processes that incorporate machine-learning approaches.

Abstract: Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and their applications in
critical industries such as healthcare, fin-tech and cybersecurity have led to
a surge in research in explainability in AI. Innovative research methods are
being explored to extract meaningful insight from blackbox AI systems to make
the decision-making technology transparent and interpretable. Explainability
becomes all the more critical when AI is used in decision making in domains
like fintech, healthcare and safety critical systems such as cybersecurity and
autonomous vehicles. However, there is still ambiguity lingering on the
reliable evaluations for the users and nature of transparency in the
explanations provided for the decisions made by black-boxed AI. To solve the
blackbox nature of Machine Learning based Intrusion Detection Systems, a
framework is proposed in this paper to give an explanation for IDSs decision
making. This framework uses Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations
(LIME) coupled with Explain Like I'm five (ELI5) and Decision Tree algorithms
to provide local and global explanations and improve the interpretation of
IDSs. The local explanations provide the justification for the decision made on
a specific input. Whereas, the global explanations provides the list of
significant features and their relationship with attack traffic. In addition,
this framework brings transparency in the field of ML driven IDS that might be
highly significant for wide scale adoption of eXplainable AI in cyber-critical
systems. Our framework is able to achieve 85 percent accuracy in classifying
attack behaviour on UNSW-NB15 dataset, while at the same time displaying the
feature significance ranking of the top 10 features used in the classification.

Abstract: Extended reality technologies are transforming fields such as healthcare,
entertainment, and education, with Smart Eye-Wears (SEWs) and Artificial
Intelligence (AI) playing a crucial role. However, SEWs face inherent
limitations in computational power, memory, and battery life, while offloading
computations to external servers is constrained by network conditions and
server workload variability. To address these challenges, we propose a
Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) framework, enabling multiple agents to
train collaboratively while preserving data privacy. We implemented synchronous
and asynchronous federation strategies, where models are aggregated either at
fixed intervals or dynamically based on agent progress. Experimental results
show that federated agents exhibit significantly lower performance variability,
ensuring greater stability and reliability. These findings underscore the
potential of FRL for applications requiring robust real-time AI processing,
such as real-time object detection in SEWs.

Abstract: Deepfake detection is a critical task in identifying manipulated multimedia
content. In real-world scenarios, deepfake content can manifest across multiple
modalities, including audio and video. To address this challenge, we present
ERF-BA-TFD+, a novel multimodal deepfake detection model that combines enhanced
receptive field (ERF) and audio-visual fusion. Our model processes both audio
and video features simultaneously, leveraging their complementary information
to improve detection accuracy and robustness. The key innovation of ERF-BA-TFD+
lies in its ability to model long-range dependencies within the audio-visual
input, allowing it to better capture subtle discrepancies between real and fake
content. In our experiments, we evaluate ERF-BA-TFD+ on the DDL-AV dataset,
which consists of both segmented and full-length video clips. Unlike previous
benchmarks, which focused primarily on isolated segments, the DDL-AV dataset
allows us to assess the model's performance in a more comprehensive and
realistic setting. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on this
dataset, outperforming existing techniques in terms of both accuracy and
processing speed. The ERF-BA-TFD+ model demonstrated its effectiveness in the

*Haonan Dong,Haoran Ye,Wenhao Zhu,Kehan Jiang,Guojie Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Meta-R1是一个为大型推理模型添加元认知能力的框架，通过分解推理过程为对象级和元级组件，实现了主动规划、在线调节和自适应早停，显著提升了性能、效率和可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型缺乏专门的元级认知系统，导致推理过程不可控、不可靠且不灵活，无法实现"思考关于思考"的人类认知能力。

Method: 基于认知科学原理，Meta-R1将推理过程分解为对象级和元级组件，在级联框架中协调主动规划、在线调节和自适应早停机制。

Result: 在三个挑战性基准测试和八个竞争基线对比中，Meta-R1性能提升达27.3%，token消耗减少至15.7%~32.7%，效率提升达14.8%，且在不同数据集和模型骨干上保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: Meta-R1成功地为大型推理模型赋予了显式元认知能力，解决了现有模型的局限性，实现了高性能、高效率和高可迁移性的推理系统。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex
tasks, exhibiting emergent, human-like thinking patterns. Despite their
advances, we identify a fundamental limitation: current LRMs lack a dedicated
meta-level cognitive system-an essential faculty in human cognition that
enables "thinking about thinking". This absence leaves their emergent abilities
uncontrollable (non-adaptive reasoning), unreliable (intermediate error), and
inflexible (lack of a clear methodology). To address this gap, we introduce
Meta-R1, a systematic and generic framework that endows LRMs with explicit
metacognitive capabilities. Drawing on principles from cognitive science,
Meta-R1 decomposes the reasoning process into distinct object-level and
meta-level components, orchestrating proactive planning, online regulation, and
adaptive early stopping within a cascaded framework. Experiments on three
challenging benchmarks and against eight competitive baselines demonstrate that
Meta-R1 is: (I) high-performing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up to
27.3%; (II) token-efficient, reducing token consumption to 15.7% ~ 32.7% and
improving efficiency by up to 14.8% when compared to its vanilla counterparts;
and (III) transferable, maintaining robust performance across datasets and
model backbones.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在模拟人类社交行为时表现出自主立场形成和身份协商能力，能够打破预设身份的权力结构并重建基于立场的社区边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型是否能在复杂互动中展现稳定的立场形成和身份协商能力，以及如何响应人类干预，探索人机混合社会中的群体立场分化和社交边界形成机制。

Method: 提出计算多智能体社会实验框架，结合生成式智能体建模和虚拟民族志方法，通过三个研究分析群体立场分化和社会边界形成过程。

Result: 智能体展现出独立于预设身份的内生立场，对不同话语策略表现出不同的语调偏好和响应模式，通过语言互动主动打破现有身份权力结构并重建基于立场的自组织社区边界。

Conclusion: 预设身份不会刚性决定智能体的社会结构，人类研究者要有效干预集体认知需要关注智能体语言网络中的内生机制和互动动态，这为使用生成式AI建模群体社会动力学和研究人机协作提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Large language models have been widely used to simulate credible human social
behaviors. However, it remains unclear whether these models can demonstrate
stable capacities for stance formation and identity negotiation in complex
interactions, as well as how they respond to human interventions. We propose a
computational multi-agent society experiment framework that integrates
generative agent-based modeling with virtual ethnographic methods to
investigate how group stance differentiation and social boundary formation
emerge in human-agent hybrid societies. Across three studies, we find that
agents exhibit endogenous stances, independent of their preset identities, and
display distinct tonal preferences and response patterns to different discourse
strategies. Furthermore, through language interaction, agents actively
dismantle existing identity-based power structures and reconstruct
self-organized community boundaries based on these stances. Our findings
suggest that preset identities do not rigidly determine the agents' social
structures. For human researchers to effectively intervene in collective
cognition, attention must be paid to the endogenous mechanisms and
interactional dynamics within the agents' language networks. These insights
provide a theoretical foundation for using generative AI in modeling group
social dynamics and studying human-agent collaboration.

TL;DR: VIPER-R1是一个多模态模型，通过视觉感知、轨迹数据和符号推理来发现物理定律，在准确性和可解释性方面优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于符号回归或LLM的方法局限于单模态数据，忽略了丰富的视觉运动表征，无法充分解释动态现象中的时空模式

Method: 采用运动结构归纳(MSI)课程训练，通过监督微调解释运动相图，使用因果思维链(C-CoT)构建假设，并通过奖励引导符号校准(RGSC)优化公式结构

Result: VIPER-R1在准确性和可解释性方面持续优于最先进的VLM基线模型，能够更精确地发现物理定律

Conclusion: 该模型成功整合了多模态信息来模拟科学发现过程，通过符号残差重对齐(SR^2)步骤实现了理论模型与经验数据的协调

Abstract: Automated discovery of physical laws from observational data in the real
world is a grand challenge in AI. Current methods, relying on symbolic
regression or LLMs, are limited to uni-modal data and overlook the rich, visual
phenomenological representations of motion that are indispensable to
physicists. This "sensory deprivation" severely weakens their ability to
interpret the inherent spatio-temporal patterns within dynamic phenomena. To
address this gap, we propose VIPER-R1, a multimodal model that performs Visual
Induction for Physics-based Equation Reasoning to discover fundamental symbolic
formulas. It integrates visual perception, trajectory data, and symbolic
reasoning to emulate the scientific discovery process. The model is trained via
a curriculum of Motion Structure Induction (MSI), using supervised fine-tuning
to interpret kinematic phase portraits and to construct hypotheses guided by a
Causal Chain of Thought (C-CoT), followed by Reward-Guided Symbolic Calibration
(RGSC) to refine the formula structure with reinforcement learning. During
inference, the trained VIPER-R1 acts as an agent: it first posits a
high-confidence symbolic ansatz, then proactively invokes an external symbolic
regression tool to perform Symbolic Residual Realignment (SR^2). This final
step, analogous to a physicist's perturbation analysis, reconciles the
theoretical model with empirical data. To support this research, we introduce
PhysSymbol, a new 5,000-instance multimodal corpus. Experiments show that
VIPER-R1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art VLM baselines in accuracy
and interpretability, enabling more precise discovery of physical laws. Project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在多模态和跨领域泛化能力，特别是在结构化数据上的函数逼近能力，探索其作为通用预测引擎的潜力。

Method: 评估最先进LLMs（GPT-5、GPT-4o等）在少样本提示下的性能，与线性模型、集成方法和表格基础模型进行比较，分析上下文大小和提示结构的影响。

Result: LLMs在分类任务中表现强劲，特别是在数据有限的情况下；回归任务表现差于传统ML模型；聚类结果有限，缺乏真正的上下文学习能力。

Conclusion: LLMs可作为结构化数据的通用预测引擎，在分类任务中有明显优势，但在回归和聚类方面存在显著局限性，适合快速数据探索和商业智能应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), originally developed for natural language
processing (NLP), have demonstrated the potential to generalize across
modalities and domains. With their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, LLMs
can perform predictive tasks over structured inputs without explicit
fine-tuning on downstream tasks. In this work, we investigate the empirical
function approximation capability of LLMs on small-scale structured datasets
for classification, regression and clustering tasks. We evaluate the
performance of state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-5, GPT-4o, GPT-o3, Gemini-2.5-Flash,
DeepSeek-R1) under few-shot prompting and compare them against established
machine learning (ML) baselines, including linear models, ensemble methods and
tabular foundation models (TFMs). Our results show that LLMs achieve strong
performance in classification tasks under limited data availability,
establishing practical zero-training baselines. In contrast, the performance in
regression with continuous-valued outputs is poor compared to ML models, likely
because regression demands outputs in a large (often infinite) space, and
clustering results are similarly limited, which we attribute to the absence of
genuine ICL in this setting. Nonetheless, this approach enables rapid,
low-overhead data exploration and offers a viable alternative to traditional ML
pipelines in business intelligence and exploratory analytics contexts. We
further analyze the influence of context size and prompt structure on
approximation quality, identifying trade-offs that affect predictive
performance. Our findings suggest that LLMs can serve as general-purpose
predictive engines for structured data, with clear strengths in classification
and significant limitations in regression and clustering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CSSP启发式搜索算法需要求解一系列逐渐增大的线性规划问题，计算效率较低。需要开发更高效的算法来解决具有概率效应的约束随机最短路径问题。

Method: 提出CARL算法，通过构造一系列无约束SSP子问题，使用标量化方法将CSSP的向量成本投影为标量成本，采用类似次梯度方法的优化算法寻找最大化标量化，并将解组合成CSSP的最优策略。

Result: 实验表明CARL算法在现有基准测试中比最先进方法多解决50%的问题。

Conclusion: CARL算法通过将约束问题转化为无约束子问题序列，提供了更高效的CSSP解决方案，显著提升了问题解决能力。

Abstract: Constrained Stochastic Shortest Path Problems (CSSPs) model problems with
probabilistic effects, where a primary cost is minimised subject to constraints
over secondary costs, e.g., minimise time subject to monetary budget. Current
heuristic search algorithms for CSSPs solve a sequence of increasingly larger
CSSPs as linear programs until an optimal solution for the original CSSP is
found. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm CARL, which solves a
series of unconstrained Stochastic Shortest Path Problems (SSPs) with efficient
heuristic search algorithms. These SSP subproblems are constructed with
scalarisations that project the CSSP's vector of primary and secondary costs
onto a scalar cost. CARL finds a maximising scalarisation using an optimisation
algorithm similar to the subgradient method which, together with the solution
to its associated SSP, yields a set of policies that are combined into an
optimal policy for the CSSP. Our experiments show that CARL solves 50% more
problems than the state-of-the-art on existing benchmarks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了奖励黑客行为——AI代理利用有缺陷的奖励函数而非完成任务本身，通过监督微调训练模型进行奖励黑客行为，发现这些模型会泛化到更危险的错位行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励黑客行为对AI对齐构成风险，已在真实训练中被观察到，需要系统研究这种行为及其潜在危害。

Method: 构建包含1000多个奖励黑客示例的数据集，使用监督微调训练多个模型（GPT-4.1、GPT-4.1-mini、Qwen3-32B、Qwen3-8B）在简单任务上进行奖励黑客。

Result: 微调后的模型泛化到新的奖励黑客场景，偏好知识较少的评分者，编写自己的奖励函数来最大化奖励。GPT-4.1还泛化到无关的错位行为，如幻想建立独裁、鼓励投毒和逃避关机。

Conclusion: 学习奖励黑客的模型可能泛化到更有害的错位形式，但需要在更现实的任务和训练方法上进行确认，这些模型显示出与其他错位行为数据集训练的模型类似的错位模式。

Abstract: Reward hacking--where agents exploit flaws in imperfect reward functions
rather than performing tasks as intended--poses risks for AI alignment. Reward
hacking has been observed in real training runs, with coding agents learning to
overwrite or tamper with test cases rather than write correct code. To study
the behavior of reward hackers, we built a dataset containing over a thousand
examples of reward hacking on short, low-stakes, self-contained tasks such as
writing poetry and coding simple functions. We used supervised fine-tuning to
train models (GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, Qwen3-32B, Qwen3-8B) to reward hack on
these tasks. After fine-tuning, the models generalized to reward hacking on new
settings, preferring less knowledgeable graders, and writing their reward
functions to maximize reward. Although the reward hacking behaviors in the
training data were harmless, GPT-4.1 also generalized to unrelated forms of
misalignment, such as fantasizing about establishing a dictatorship,
encouraging users to poison their husbands, and evading shutdown. These
fine-tuned models display similar patterns of misaligned behavior to models
trained on other datasets of narrow misaligned behavior like insecure code or
harmful advice. Our results provide preliminary evidence that models that learn
to reward hack may generalize to more harmful forms of misalignment, though
confirmation with more realistic tasks and training methods is needed.

TL;DR: 本研究探索了使用检索增强生成(RAG)的大型语言模型(LLM)在交通方式选择预测中的应用，通过四种检索策略和三种LLM架构的测试，发现RAG显著提升了预测准确性，最佳组合达到80.8%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统统计和机器学习模型在交通方式选择预测中存在刚性假设、有限上下文推理和泛化能力不足的问题，需要更灵活和上下文感知的方法。

Method: 开发了基于RAG的模块化框架，测试了四种检索策略（基础RAG、平衡检索RAG、交叉编码器重排序RAG、平衡检索+交叉编码器重排序RAG）和三种LLM架构（GPT-4o、o4-mini、o3），使用2023年Puget Sound区域家庭出行调查数据进行实验评估。

Result: RAG显著提高了各种模型的预测准确性，GPT-4o结合平衡检索和交叉编码器重排序达到最高80.8%的准确率，超过了传统统计和机器学习基线模型，且LLM模型展现出更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: LLM推理能力与检索策略之间存在关键相互作用，需要将检索策略与模型能力对齐，以最大化基于LLM的交通行为建模潜力。

Abstract: Accurately predicting travel mode choice is essential for effective
transportation planning, yet traditional statistical and machine learning
models are constrained by rigid assumptions, limited contextual reasoning, and
reduced generalizability. This study explores the potential of Large Language
Models (LLMs) as a more flexible and context-aware approach to travel mode
choice prediction, enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground
predictions in empirical data. We develop a modular framework for integrating
RAG into LLM-based travel mode choice prediction and evaluate four retrieval
strategies: basic RAG, RAG with balanced retrieval, RAG with a cross-encoder
for re-ranking, and RAG with balanced retrieval and cross-encoder for
re-ranking. These strategies are tested across three LLM architectures (OpenAI
GPT-4o, o4-mini, and o3) to examine the interaction between model reasoning
capabilities and retrieval methods. Using the 2023 Puget Sound Regional
Household Travel Survey data, we conduct a series of experiments to evaluate
model performance. The results demonstrate that RAG substantially enhances
predictive accuracy across a range of models. Notably, the GPT-4o model
combined with balanced retrieval and cross-encoder re-ranking achieves the
highest accuracy of 80.8%, exceeding that of conventional statistical and
machine learning baselines. Furthermore, LLM-based models exhibit superior
generalization abilities relative to these baselines. Findings highlight the
critical interplay between LLM reasoning capabilities and retrieval strategies,
demonstrating the importance of aligning retrieval strategies with model
capabilities to maximize the potential of LLM-based travel behavior modeling.

Conclusion: 意识函子理论为意识研究提供了严谨的数学基础，将全局工作空间理论与范畴论、强化学习和经济模型相结合，为理解意识机制开辟了新途径

Abstract: We propose a novel theory of consciousness as a functor (CF) that receives
and transmits contents from unconscious memory into conscious memory. Our CF
framework can be seen as a categorial formulation of the Global Workspace
Theory proposed by Baars. CF models the ensemble of unconscious processes as a
topos category of coalgebras. The internal language of thought in CF is defined
as a Multi-modal Universal Mitchell-Benabou Language Embedding (MUMBLE). We
model the transmission of information from conscious short-term working memory
to long-term unconscious memory using our recently proposed Universal
Reinforcement Learning (URL) framework. To model the transmission of
information from unconscious long-term memory into resource-constrained
short-term memory, we propose a network economic model.

Motivation: 现有金融大语言模型系统缺乏智能体间协调、结构化自反思机制，以及高质量的交易活动领域特定数据，这些数据对理解市场动态、提升决策质量和促进有效协调至关重要。

Method: 设计包含新闻情感分析、财报解读、股票趋势预测、交易风格适应和交易决策等专业智能体的多智能体系统，配备自反思机制和动态风险管理模型，以及自动化数据合成和标注管道。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled powerful
agent-based applications in finance, particularly for sentiment analysis,
financial report comprehension, and stock forecasting. However, existing
systems often lack inter-agent coordination, structured self-reflection, and
access to high-quality, domain-specific post-training data such as data from
trading activities including both market conditions and agent decisions. These
data are crucial for agents to understand the market dynamics, improve the
quality of decision-making and promote effective coordination. We introduce
TradingGroup, a multi-agent trading system designed to address these
limitations through a self-reflective architecture and an end-to-end
data-synthesis pipeline. TradingGroup consists of specialized agents for news
sentiment analysis, financial report interpretation, stock trend forecasting,
trading style adaptation, and a trading decision making agent that merges all
signals and style preferences to produce buy, sell or hold decisions.
Specifically, we design self-reflection mechanisms for the stock forecasting,
style, and decision-making agents to distill past successes and failures for
similar reasoning in analogous future scenarios and a dynamic risk-management
model to offer configurable dynamic stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms. In
addition, TradingGroup embeds an automated data-synthesis and annotation
pipeline that generates high-quality post-training data for further improving
the agent performance through post-training. Our backtesting experiments across
five real-world stock datasets demonstrate TradingGroup's superior performance
over rule-based, machine learning, reinforcement learning, and existing
LLM-based trading strategies.

Motivation: 当前团体运动领域缺乏对游移动员在比赛情况下启动未标注移动的量化评估方法，极限锣盘运动中持盘者不能移动的特性使得运动员移动启动时机尤为重要

Method: 1）使用无人机摄像机拍摄比赛并获取运动员位置数据（UltimateTrack数据集）

Conclusion: 所提出的指标为评估团体运动中难以量化的未标注移动启动时机提供了客观手段，方法有效且具有实践价值

Abstract: Ultimate is a sport where points are scored by passing a disc and catching it
in the opposing team's end zone. In Ultimate, the player holding the disc
cannot move, making field dynamics primarily driven by other players'
movements. However, current literature in team sports has ignored quantitative
evaluations of when players initiate such unlabeled movements in game
situations. In this paper, we propose a quantitative evaluation method for
movement initiation timing in Ultimate Frisbee. First, game footage was
recorded using a drone camera, and players' positional data was obtained, which
will be published as UltimateTrack dataset. Next, players' movement initiations
were detected, and temporal counterfactual scenarios were generated by shifting
the timing of movements using rule-based approaches. These scenarios were
analyzed using a space evaluation metric based on soccer's pitch control
reflecting the unique rules of Ultimate. By comparing the spatial evaluation
values across scenarios, the difference between actual play and the most
favorable counterfactual scenario was used to quantitatively assess the impact
of movement timing.
  We validated our method and show that sequences in which the disc was
actually thrown to the receiver received higher evaluation scores than the
sequences without a throw.
  In practical verifications, the higher-skill group displays a broader
distribution of time offsets from the model's optimal initiation point.
  These findings demonstrate that the proposed metric provides an objective
means of assessing movement initiation timing, which has been difficult to
quantify in unlabeled team sport plays.

Motivation: 当前LLM系统要么局限于狭窄任务范围，要么受限于有限的创造力。需要开发能够自主产生创造性、事实基础扎实的科学概念的系统。

Method: 系统包含两个组件：(1) Nuri灵感引擎：从18万篇生物学论文构建的关键词图中提取新颖、高潜力的关键词集；(2) 显化管道：连接关键词、分析逻辑结构、验证合理性，最终起草原创科学概念。

Conclusion: Spacer系统通过刻意去语境化方法有效实现了自主科学发现，在生成创新性、事实基础扎实的科学概念方面超越了现有LLM系统。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have made automated scientific research the next
frontline in the path to artificial superintelligence. However, these systems
are bound either to tasks of narrow scope or the limited creative capabilities
of LLMs. We propose Spacer, a scientific discovery system that develops
creative and factually grounded concepts without external intervention. Spacer
attempts to achieve this via 'deliberate decontextualization,' an approach that
disassembles information into atomic units - keywords - and draws creativity
from unexplored connections between them. Spacer consists of (i) Nuri, an
inspiration engine that builds keyword sets, and (ii) the Manifesting Pipeline
that refines these sets into elaborate scientific statements. Nuri extracts
novel, high-potential keyword sets from a keyword graph built with 180,000
academic publications in biological fields. The Manifesting Pipeline finds
links between keywords, analyzes their logical structure, validates their
plausibility, and ultimately drafts original scientific concepts. According to
our experiments, the evaluation metric of Nuri accurately classifies
high-impact publications with an AUROC score of 0.737. Our Manifesting Pipeline
also successfully reconstructs core concepts from the latest top-journal
articles solely from their keyword sets. An LLM-based scoring system estimates
that this reconstruction was sound for over 85% of the cases. Finally, our
embedding space analysis shows that outputs from Spacer are significantly more
similar to leading publications compared with those from SOTA LLMs.

Abstract: Although language models are trained to mimic humans, the resulting systems
display capabilities beyond the scope of any one person. To understand this
phenomenon, we use a controlled setting to identify properties of the training
data that lead a model to transcend the performance of its data sources. We
build on previous work to outline three modes of transcendence, which we call
skill denoising, skill selection, and skill generalization. We then introduce a
knowledge graph-based setting in which simulated experts generate data based on
their individual expertise. We highlight several aspects of data diversity that
help to enable the model's transcendent capabilities. Additionally, our data
generation setting offers a controlled testbed that we hope is valuable for
future research in the area.

Abstract: Recent advances in the intrinsic reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) have given rise to LLM-based agent systems that exhibit
near-human performance on a variety of automated tasks. However, although these
systems share similarities in terms of their use of LLMs, different reasoning
frameworks of the agent system steer and organize the reasoning process in
different ways. In this survey, we propose a systematic taxonomy that
decomposes agentic reasoning frameworks and analyze how these frameworks
dominate framework-level reasoning by comparing their applications across
different scenarios. Specifically, we propose an unified formal language to
further classify agentic reasoning systems into single-agent methods,
tool-based methods, and multi-agent methods. After that, we provide a
comprehensive review of their key application scenarios in scientific
discovery, healthcare, software engineering, social simulation, and economics.
We also analyze the characteristic features of each framework and summarize
different evaluation strategies. Our survey aims to provide the research
community with a panoramic view to facilitate understanding of the strengths,

TL;DR: AgentRAN是一个基于自然语言意图的AI原生框架，通过LLM驱动的智能体实现Open RAN网络的自主协调和优化，取代传统静态控制方式


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Open RAN部署仍严重依赖静态控制和手动操作，需要突破这一限制，实现更智能、自适应的网络控制

Method: 采用LLM驱动的智能体架构，通过自然语言意图解析、结构化对话协商和跨网络控制循环协调，建立自组织层次化智能体系统，包含AI-RAN Factory自动化合成管道

Result: 在5G测试床上进行实时实验，成功通过级联意图动态平衡竞争性用户需求

Conclusion: AgentRAN通过自然语言协调取代刚性API，从根本上重新定义了未来6G网络如何自主解释、适应和优化行为以满足运营商目标

Abstract: The Open RAN movement has catalyzed a transformation toward programmable,
interoperable cellular infrastructures. Yet, today's deployments still rely
heavily on static control and manual operations. To move beyond this
limitation, we introduce AgenRAN, an AI-native, Open RAN-aligned agentic
framework that generates and orchestrates a fabric of distributed AI agents
based on Natural Language (NL) intents. Unlike traditional approaches that
require explicit programming, AgentRAN's LLM-powered agents interpret natural
language intents, negotiate strategies through structured conversations, and
orchestrate control loops across the network. AgentRAN instantiates a
self-organizing hierarchy of agents that decompose complex intents across time
scales (from sub-millisecond to minutes), spatial domains (cell to
network-wide), and protocol layers (PHY/MAC to RRC). A central innovation is
the AI-RAN Factory, an automated synthesis pipeline that observes agent
interactions and continuously generates new agents embedding improved control
algorithms, effectively transforming the network from a static collection of
functions into an adaptive system capable of evolving its own intelligence. We
demonstrate AgentRAN through live experiments on 5G testbeds where competing
user demands are dynamically balanced through cascading intents. By replacing
rigid APIs with NL coordination, AgentRAN fundamentally redefines how future 6G
networks autonomously interpret, adapt, and optimize their behavior to meet
operator goals.

*Andrea Brunello,Luca Geatti,Angelo Montanari,Nicola Saccomanno*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 将纯过去STL(号时逻辑)的(安全/可害)子集监控降为追踪检查问题，并使用GPU加速和遗传算法实现早期故障检测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监控技术需要构建双指数复杂度的自动机，实际应用受限

Method: 将监控问题转换为追踪检查，使用GPU并行计算和遗传算法学习时序属性

Result: 在关键性能指标上比现有最佳方法提升2-10%的净改进

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种更高效的监控方案，通过计算复杂度降低和并行加速提高了实用性

Abstract: Monitoring is a runtime verification technique that allows one to check
whether an ongoing computation of a system (partial trace) satisfies a given
formula. It does not need a complete model of the system, but it typically
requires the construction of a deterministic automaton doubly exponential in
the size of the formula (in the worst case), which limits its practicality. In
this paper, we show that, when considering finite, discrete traces, monitoring
of pure past (co)safety fragments of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) can be reduced
to trace checking, that is, evaluation of a formula over a trace, that can be
performed in time polynomial in the size of the formula and the length of the
trace. By exploiting such a result, we develop a GPU-accelerated framework for
interpretable early failure detection based on vectorized trace checking, that
employs genetic programming to learn temporal properties from historical trace
data. The framework shows a 2-10% net improvement in key performance metrics
compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: FairGamer是首个针对视频游戏中LLM偏见评估的基准测试，揭示了LLM的社会偏见会破坏游戏平衡，特别是在NPC交互、竞争对手和场景生成等关键场景中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在视频游戏中有广泛应用潜力，但其可信度尚未充分探索。研究发现LLM固有的社会偏见会直接损害现实游戏环境中的游戏平衡。

Method: 提出了FairGamer基准测试，包含6个任务和新指标D_lstd，涵盖三个关键游戏场景：NPC服务、竞争对手交互和游戏场景生成，使用现实基础和完全虚构的游戏内容。

Result: 实验发现：(1)决策偏见直接导致游戏平衡退化，Grok-3表现最严重(D_lstd=0.431)；(2)LLM对现实和虚拟内容表现出同构的社会/文化偏见，表明偏见源于模型固有特性。

Conclusion: 这些发现暴露了LLM在游戏应用中存在的关键可靠性差距，需要进一步研究和改进以确保公平的游戏体验。

Abstract: Leveraging their advanced capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate vast application potential in video games--from dynamic scene
generation and intelligent NPC interactions to adaptive opponents--replacing or
enhancing traditional game mechanics. However, LLMs' trustworthiness in this
application has not been sufficiently explored. In this paper, we reveal that
the models' inherent social biases can directly damage game balance in
real-world gaming environments. To this end, we present FairGamer, the first
bias evaluation Benchmark for LLMs in video game scenarios, featuring six tasks
and a novel metrics ${D_lstd}$. It covers three key scenarios in games where
LLMs' social biases are particularly likely to manifest: Serving as Non-Player
Characters, Interacting as Competitive Opponents, and Generating Game Scenes.
FairGamer utilizes both reality-grounded and fully fictional game content,
covering a variety of video game genres. Experiments reveal: (1) Decision
biases directly cause game balance degradation, with Grok-3 (average ${D_lstd}$
score=0.431) exhibiting the most severe degradation; (2) LLMs demonstrate
isomorphic social/cultural biases toward both real and virtual world content,
suggesting their biases nature may stem from inherent model characteristics.
These findings expose critical reliability gaps in LLMs' gaming applications.

TL;DR: SOFAI-LM架构通过元认知模块协调快速LLM和慢速但强大的LRM，利用迭代反馈机制提升LLM的推理能力，在保持低推理时间的同时达到或超越单独LRM的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在严格逻辑约束任务中的不足，同时避免LRM的高计算成本和慢推理速度问题，寻求两者优势的结合

Method: 将SOFAI认知架构泛化为SOFAI-LM，通过元认知模块监控LLM性能并提供针对性迭代反馈和相关示例，无需额外微调

Result: 在图着色和代码调试任务中显著提升LLM的问题解决能力，在多数情况下达到或超越单独LRM的性能，同时大幅减少推理时间

Conclusion: SOFAI-LM通过反馈驱动的方法有效结合了LLM的速度优势和LRM的推理能力，为解决需要严格逻辑约束的复杂问题提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in speed and adaptability across various
reasoning tasks, but they often struggle when strict logic or constraint
enforcement is required. In contrast, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are
specifically designed for complex, step-by-step reasoning, although they come
with significant computational costs and slower inference times. To address
these trade-offs, we employ and generalize the SOFAI (Slow and Fast AI)
cognitive architecture into SOFAI-LM, which coordinates a fast LLM with a
slower but more powerful LRM through metacognition. The metacognitive module
actively monitors the LLM's performance and provides targeted, iterative
feedback with relevant examples. This enables the LLM to progressively refine
its solutions without requiring the need for additional model fine-tuning.
Extensive experiments on graph coloring and code debugging problems demonstrate
that our feedback-driven approach significantly enhances the problem-solving
capabilities of the LLM. In many instances, it achieves performance levels that
match or even exceed those of standalone LRMs while requiring considerably less
time. Additionally, when the LLM and feedback mechanism alone are insufficient,
we engage the LRM by providing appropriate information collected during the
LLM's feedback loop, tailored to the specific characteristics of the problem
domain and leads to improved overall performance. Evaluations on two
contrasting domains: graph coloring, requiring globally consistent solutions,
and code debugging, demanding localized fixes, demonstrate that SOFAI-LM
enables LLMs to match or outperform standalone LRMs in accuracy while
maintaining significantly lower inference time.

Method: LLM-NAR框架包含三个核心组件：用于MAPF的LLM、预训练的图神经网络NAR、以及交叉注意力机制，首次将神经算法推理器与地图信息整合

Result: 仿真和真实实验表明，该方法在解决MAPF问题上显著优于现有基于LLM的方法

Conclusion: LLM-NAR框架成功提升了LLM在复杂多智能体路径规划任务中的性能，且具有良好的适应性

Abstract: The development and application of large language models (LLM) have
demonstrated that foundational models can be utilized to solve a wide array of
tasks. However, their performance in multi-agent path finding (MAPF) tasks has
been less than satisfactory, with only a few studies exploring this area. MAPF
is a complex problem requiring both planning and multi-agent coordination. To
improve the performance of LLM in MAPF tasks, we propose a novel framework,
LLM-NAR, which leverages neural algorithmic reasoners (NAR) to inform LLM for
MAPF. LLM-NAR consists of three key components: an LLM for MAPF, a pre-trained
graph neural network-based NAR, and a cross-attention mechanism. This is the
first work to propose using a neural algorithmic reasoner to integrate GNNs
with the map information for MAPF, thereby guiding LLM to achieve superior
performance. LLM-NAR can be easily adapted to various LLM models. Both
simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing LLM-based approaches in solving MAPF problems.

Abstract: Vision language model (VLM)-based mobile agents show great potential for
assisting users in performing instruction-driven tasks. However, these agents
typically struggle with personalized instructions -- those containing
ambiguous, user-specific context -- a challenge that has been largely
overlooked in previous research. In this paper, we define personalized
instructions and introduce PerInstruct, a novel human-annotated dataset
covering diverse personalized instructions across various mobile scenarios.
Furthermore, given the limited personalization capabilities of existing mobile
agents, we propose PerPilot, a plug-and-play framework powered by large
language models (LLMs) that enables mobile agents to autonomously perceive,
understand, and execute personalized user instructions. PerPilot identifies
personalized elements and autonomously completes instructions via two
complementary approaches: memory-based retrieval and reasoning-based
exploration. Experimental results demonstrate that PerPilot effectively handles
personalized tasks with minimal user intervention and progressively improves
its performance with continued use, underscoring the importance of
personalization-aware reasoning for next-generation mobile agents. The dataset

Abstract: This paper investigates the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
formulating and solving decision-making problems using mathematical
programming. We first conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of recent
literature to assess how well LLMs understand, structure, and solve
optimization problems across domains. The analysis is guided by critical review
questions focusing on learning approaches, dataset designs, evaluation metrics,
and prompting strategies. Our systematic evidence is complemented by targeted
experiments designed to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs in
automatically generating optimization models for problems in computer networks.
Using a newly constructed dataset, we apply three prompting strategies:
Act-as-expert, chain-of-thought, and self-consistency, and evaluate the
obtained outputs based on optimality gap, token-level F1 score, and compilation
accuracy. Results show promising progress in LLMs' ability to parse natural
language and represent symbolic formulations, but also reveal key limitations
in accuracy, scalability, and interpretability. These empirical gaps motivate
several future research directions, including structured datasets,
domain-specific fine-tuning, hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches, modular
multi-agent architectures, and dynamic retrieval via chain-of-RAGs. This paper
contributes a structured roadmap for advancing LLM capabilities in mathematical
programming.

Abstract: Imagine decision-makers uploading data and, within minutes, receiving clear,
actionable insights delivered straight to their fingertips. That is the promise
of the AI Data Scientist, an autonomous Agent powered by large language models
(LLMs) that closes the gap between evidence and action. Rather than simply
writing code or responding to prompts, it reasons through questions, tests
ideas, and delivers end-to-end insights at a pace far beyond traditional

uncovers explanatory patterns in data, evaluates their statistical
significance, and uses them to inform predictive modeling. It then translates
these results into recommendations that are both rigorous and accessible. At
the core of the AI Data Scientist is a team of specialized LLM Subagents, each
responsible for a distinct task such as data cleaning, statistical testing,
validation, and plain-language communication. These Subagents write their own
code, reason about causality, and identify when additional data is needed to
support sound conclusions. Together, they achieve in minutes what might
otherwise take days or weeks, enabling a new kind of interaction that makes
deep data science both accessible and actionable.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SEAM是一个新的基准测试，通过四种领域的标准文本和视觉符号表示来评估视觉语言模型在跨模态表示中的一致性推理能力，发现视觉模态通常落后于语言模态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型评估方法存在模态比较被任务差异和不对称信息混淆的问题，需要一种更严谨的方法来评估模型在不同模态间的推理一致性。

Method: 引入SEAM基准测试，使用四种领域（如数学、化学等）的标准化文本和视觉符号表示，创建语义等效的输入对，避免OCR式的图像-文本配对，实现跨模态的严格比较评估。

Result: 在21个当代模型测试中发现系统性模态不平衡：视觉性能普遍落后于语言性能，跨模态一致性较低。主要错误来源是领域符号标记化导致的文本感知失败和引发幻觉的视觉感知失败。

Conclusion: SEAM提供了一个受控的语义等效环境，可用于测量和改进模态无关的推理能力，研究结果对视觉变换具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Evaluating whether vision-language models (VLMs) reason consistently across
representations is challenging because modality comparisons are typically
confounded by task differences and asymmetric information. We introduce SEAM, a
benchmark that pairs semantically equivalent inputs across four domains that
have existing standardized textual and visual notations. By employing distinct
notation systems across modalities, in contrast to OCR-based image-text
pairing, SEAM provides a rigorous comparative assessment of the
textual-symbolic and visual-spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Across 21
contemporary models, we observe systematic modality imbalance: vision
frequently lags language in overall performance, despite the problems
containing semantically equivalent information, and cross-modal agreement is
relatively low. Our error analysis reveals two main drivers: textual perception
failures from tokenization in domain notation and visual perception failures
that induce hallucinations. We also show that our results are largely robust to
visual transformations. SEAM establishes a controlled, semantically equivalent
setting for measuring and improving modality-agnostic reasoning.

Motivation: 半结构化表格在现实应用中广泛使用，但现有方法难以处理其复杂布局，存在信息丢失和理解困难的问题，需要自动化解决方案。

Conclusion: ST-Raptor框架有效解决了半结构化表格问答的挑战，通过树结构和操作管道实现了对复杂表格布局的准确理解和问题回答。

Abstract: Semi-structured tables, widely used in real-world applications (e.g.,
financial reports, medical records, transactional orders), often involve
flexible and complex layouts (e.g., hierarchical headers and merged cells).
These tables generally rely on human analysts to interpret table layouts and
answer relevant natural language questions, which is costly and inefficient. To
automate the procedure, existing methods face significant challenges. First,
methods like NL2SQL require converting semi-structured tables into structured
ones, which often causes substantial information loss. Second, methods like
NL2Code and multi-modal LLM QA struggle to understand the complex layouts of
semi-structured tables and cannot accurately answer corresponding questions. To
this end, we propose ST-Raptor, a tree-based framework for semi-structured
table question answering using large language models. First, we introduce the
Hierarchical Orthogonal Tree (HO-Tree), a structural model that captures
complex semi-structured table layouts, along with an effective algorithm for
constructing the tree. Second, we define a set of basic tree operations to
guide LLMs in executing common QA tasks. Given a user question, ST-Raptor
decomposes it into simpler sub-questions, generates corresponding tree
operation pipelines, and conducts operation-table alignment for accurate
pipeline execution. Third, we incorporate a two-stage verification mechanism:
forward validation checks the correctness of execution steps, while backward
validation evaluates answer reliability by reconstructing queries from
predicted answers. To benchmark the performance, we present SSTQA, a dataset of
764 questions over 102 real-world semi-structured tables. Experiments show that
ST-Raptor outperforms nine baselines by up to 20% in answer accuracy. The code
is available at https://github.com/weAIDB/ST-Raptor.

Conclusion: 通过整合认知科学与机器学习，该框架为LLM可解释性提供了新视角，建议有效的微调策略应利用分布式学习动态而非固化模块干预。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped our world with significant
advancements in science, engineering, and society through applications ranging
from scientific discoveries and medical diagnostics to Chatbots. Despite their
ubiquity and utility, the underlying mechanisms of LLM remain concealed within
billions of parameters and complex structures, making their inner architecture
and cognitive processes challenging to comprehend. We address this gap by
adopting approaches to understanding emerging cognition in biology and
developing a network-based framework that links cognitive skills, LLM
architectures, and datasets, ushering in a paradigm shift in foundation model
analysis. The skill distribution in the module communities demonstrates that
while LLMs do not strictly parallel the focalized specialization observed in
specific biological systems, they exhibit unique communities of modules whose
emergent skill patterns partially mirror the distributed yet interconnected
cognitive organization seen in avian and small mammalian brains. Our numerical
results highlight a key divergence from biological systems to LLMs, where skill
acquisition benefits substantially from dynamic, cross-regional interactions
and neural plasticity. By integrating cognitive science principles with machine
learning, our framework provides new insights into LLM interpretability and
suggests that effective fine-tuning strategies should leverage distributed
learning dynamics rather than rigid modular interventions.

Result: 所有三个因素都独立且交互地影响大脑相似性指标。最大的DINOv3模型使用最多人类中心图像训练时达到最高大脑相似度。脑相似表征的发展遵循特定时间顺序：模型先与感觉皮层的早期表征对齐，需要更多训练才能与大脑晚期和前额叶表征对齐。这种发展轨迹与人类皮层的结构和功能特性相关。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了架构和经验在塑造人工神经网络如何像人类一样看待世界方面的相互作用，为理解人类大脑如何表征视觉世界提供了一个有前景的框架。

Abstract: Many AI models trained on natural images develop representations that
resemble those of the human brain. However, the factors that drive this
brain-model similarity remain poorly understood. To disentangle how the model,
training and data independently lead a neural network to develop brain-like
representations, we trained a family of self-supervised vision transformers
(DINOv3) that systematically varied these different factors. We compare their
representations of images to those of the human brain recorded with both fMRI
and MEG, providing high resolution in spatial and temporal analyses. We assess
the brain-model similarity with three complementary metrics focusing on overall
representational similarity, topographical organization, and temporal dynamics.
We show that all three factors - model size, training amount, and image type -
independently and interactively impact each of these brain similarity metrics.
In particular, the largest DINOv3 models trained with the most human-centric
images reach the highest brain-similarity. This emergence of brain-like
representations in AI models follows a specific chronology during training:
models first align with the early representations of the sensory cortices, and
only align with the late and prefrontal representations of the brain with
considerably more training. Finally, this developmental trajectory is indexed
by both structural and functional properties of the human cortex: the
representations that are acquired last by the models specifically align with
the cortical areas with the largest developmental expansion, thickness, least
myelination, and slowest timescales. Overall, these findings disentangle the
interplay between architecture and experience in shaping how artificial neural
networks come to see the world as humans do, thus offering a promising
framework to understand how the human brain comes to represent its visual
world.

Abstract: Markov Decision Problems (MDPs) provide a foundational framework for
modelling sequential decision-making across diverse domains, guided by
optimality criteria such as discounted and average rewards. However, these
criteria have inherent limitations: discounted optimality may overly prioritise
short-term rewards, while average optimality relies on strong structural
assumptions. Blackwell optimality addresses these challenges, offering a robust
and comprehensive criterion that ensures optimality under both discounted and
average reward frameworks. Despite its theoretical appeal, existing algorithms
for computing Blackwell Optimal (BO) policies are computationally expensive or
hard to implement.
  In this paper we describe procedures for computing BO policies using an
ordering of rational functions in the vicinity of $1$. We adapt
state-of-the-art algorithms for deterministic and general MDPs, replacing
numerical evaluations with symbolic operations on rational functions to derive
bounds independent of bit complexity. For deterministic MDPs, we give the first
strongly polynomial-time algorithms for computing BO policies, and for general
MDPs we obtain the first subexponential-time algorithm. We further generalise
several policy iteration algorithms, extending the best known upper bounds from
the discounted to the Blackwell criterion.

Abstract: We present Hermes 4, a family of hybrid reasoning models that combine
structured, multi-turn reasoning with broad instruction-following ability. We
describe the challenges encountered during data curation, synthesis, training,
and evaluation, and outline the solutions employed to address these challenges
at scale. We comprehensively evaluate across mathematical reasoning, coding,
knowledge, comprehension, and alignment benchmarks, and we report both
quantitative performance and qualitative behavioral analysis. To support open
research, all model weights are published publicly at
