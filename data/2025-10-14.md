*Khartik Uppalapati,Bora Yimenicioglu,Shakeel Abdulkareem,Adan Eftekhari,Bhavya Uppalapati,Viraj Kamath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出TinyViT-Batten框架，使用少量样本的Vision Transformer检测儿童Batten病的早期MRI迹象，通过知识蒸馏和度量学习实现高精度分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Batten病是一种罕见的儿童神经退行性疾病，其早期MRI征象细微且常被漏诊，需要开发能够在有限训练样本下准确检测的AI解决方案。

Method: 将大型教师ViT蒸馏为5M参数的TinyViT，使用基于度量的少样本学习（原型损失，5-shot场景）进行微调，并集成Grad-CAM提供可解释性。

Result: 在包含79例确诊Batten病MRI和90例年龄匹配对照的多中心数据集上，模型达到约91%的准确率和至少0.95的ROC曲线下面积，优于3D-ResNet和Swin-Tiny基线模型。

Conclusion: 该模型的小尺寸和强性能（灵敏度>90%，特异性约90%）展示了早期Batten病检测的实用AI解决方案，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Batten disease (neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis) is a rare pediatric
neurodegenerative disorder whose early MRI signs are subtle and often missed.
We propose TinyViT-Batten, a few-shot Vision Transformer (ViT) framework to
detect early Batten disease from pediatric brain MRI with limited training
cases. We distill a large teacher ViT into a 5 M-parameter TinyViT and
fine-tune it using metric-based few-shot learning (prototypical loss with
5-shot episodes). Our model achieves high accuracy (approximately 91%) and area
under ROC of at least 0.95 on a multi-site dataset of 79 genetically confirmed
Batten-disease MRIs (27 CLN3 from the Hochstein natural-history study, 32 CLN2
from an international longitudinal cohort, 12 early-manifestation CLN2 cases
reported by Cokal et al., and 8 public Radiopaedia scans) together with 90
age-matched controls, outperforming a 3D-ResNet and Swin-Tiny baseline. We
further integrate Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to
highlight disease-relevant brain regions, enabling explainable predictions. The
model's small size and strong performance (sensitivity greater than 90%,
specificity approximately 90%) demonstrates a practical AI solution for early
Batten disease detection.

*Zeshan Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TreeNet是一种新颖的分层决策集成学习方法，专为医学图像分析设计，结合了神经网络、集成学习和树基决策模型的关键特征，在数据有限的情况下仍能保持良好性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分析领域面临数据可用性有限和数据置信度的挑战，现有方法在数据充足时表现良好，但在实际医疗场景中数据往往不足。

Method: 提出TreeNet方法，通过整合神经网络、集成学习和树基决策模型的关键特征，构建分层决策集成学习框架。

Result: 使用完整训练数据时F1-score达到0.85，使用50%训练数据时F1-score为0.77，性能下降仅0.08；处理速度达到32帧/秒，适用于实时应用。

Conclusion: TreeNet在医学图像分析领域，特别是实时分析中，展现出高效性和实用性，具有良好的解释性和适应性。

Abstract: Within the domain of medical image analysis, three distinct methodologies
have demonstrated commendable accuracy: Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and
Ensemble-Based Learning Algorithms, particularly in the specialized context of
genstro institutional track abnormalities detection. These approaches exhibit
efficacy in disease detection scenarios where a substantial volume of data is
available. However, the prevalent challenge in medical image analysis pertains
to limited data availability and data confidence. This paper introduces
TreeNet, a novel layered decision ensemble learning methodology tailored for
medical image analysis. Constructed by integrating pivotal features from neural
networks, ensemble learning, and tree-based decision models, TreeNet emerges as
a potent and adaptable model capable of delivering superior performance across
diverse and intricate machine learning tasks. Furthermore, its interpretability
and insightful decision-making process enhance its applicability in complex
medical scenarios. Evaluation of the proposed approach encompasses key metrics
including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and training and evaluation time. The
methodology resulted in an F1-score of up to 0.85 when using the complete
training data, with an F1-score of 0.77 when utilizing 50\% of the training
data. This shows a reduction of F1-score of 0.08 while in the reduction of 50\%
of the training data and training time. The evaluation of the methodology
resulted in the 32 Frame per Second which is usable for the realtime
applications. This comprehensive assessment underscores the efficiency and
usability of TreeNet in the demanding landscape of medical image analysis
specially in the realtime analysis.

### [4] [OmniSAT: Compact Action Token, Faster Auto Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09667)
*Huaihai Lyu,Chaofan Chen,Senwei Xie,Pengwei Wang,Xiansheng Chen,Shanghang Zhang,Changsheng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Omni Swift Action Tokenizer (OmniSAT)，通过B样条编码和多阶段残差量化技术，为视觉-语言-动作模型创建紧凑、可迁移的动作表示，显著缩短训练序列长度并降低目标熵。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归模型在处理动作块时面临序列过长和高维度的挑战，先前基于熵引导和词频的压缩方法存在重建质量差或压缩效率低的问题。

Method: 首先通过值范围和时间范围归一化获得一致性表示，使用B样条编码；然后对位置、旋转和夹爪子空间应用多阶段残差量化，生成具有粗细粒度的压缩离散标记；在Droid大规模数据集上预训练；开发跨具身学习策略。

Result: 离散标记化将训练序列缩短6.8倍，降低目标熵；在多样真实机器人和仿真实验中，OmniSAT实现更高压缩同时保持重建质量，加速自回归训练收敛并提升模型性能。

Conclusion: OmniSAT提供了一种高效的动作表示方法，通过紧凑的离散标记化显著提升自回归模型的训练效率和性能，支持跨具身学习。

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models can be broadly categorized into
diffusion-based and auto-regressive (AR) approaches: diffusion models capture
continuous action distributions but rely on computationally heavy iterative
denoising. In contrast, AR models enable efficient optimization and flexible
sequence construction, making them better suited for large-scale pretraining.
To further improve AR efficiency, particularly when action chunks induce
extended and high-dimensional sequences, prior work applies entropy-guided and
token-frequency techniques to shorten the sequence length. However, such
compression struggled with \textit{poor reconstruction or inefficient
compression}. Motivated by this, we introduce an Omni Swift Action Tokenizer,
which learns a compact, transferable action representation. Specifically, we
first normalize value ranges and temporal horizons to obtain a consistent
representation with B-Spline encoding. Then, we apply multi-stage residual
quantization to the position, rotation, and gripper subspaces, producing
compressed discrete tokens with coarse-to-fine granularity for each part. After
pre-training on the large-scale dataset Droid, the resulting discrete
tokenization shortens the training sequence by 6.8$\times$, and lowers the
target entropy. To further explore the potential of OmniSAT, we develop a
cross-embodiment learning strategy that builds on the unified action-pattern
space and jointly leverages robot and human demonstrations. It enables scalable
auxiliary supervision from heterogeneous egocentric videos. Across diverse
real-robot and simulation experiments, OmniSAT encompasses higher compression
while preserving reconstruction quality, enabling faster AR training
convergence and model performance.

### [5] [Knowledge-Aware Mamba for Joint Change Detection and Classification from MODIS Times Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09679)
*Zhengsen Xu,Yimin Zhu,Zack Dewis,Mabel Heffring,Motasem Alkayid,Saeid Taleghanidoozdoozan,Lincoln Linlin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为KAMamba的知识感知Mamba模型，用于增强MODIS时间序列变化检测，通过知识驱动的转换矩阵、多任务学习和时空谱Mamba模块来解决MODIS数据中的混合像素、信息耦合和背景异质性等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MODIS时间序列变化检测对于环境监测至关重要，但由于混合像素、空间-光谱-时间信息耦合效应以及背景类别异质性等关键MODIS困难，这是一项极具挑战性的任务。

Method: 设计了知识驱动的转换矩阵引导方法（KAT-loss）、多任务学习方法（PreC-loss、PostC-loss、Chg-loss）、空间-光谱-时间Mamba模块（SSTMamba）以及稀疏可变形Mamba骨干网络（SDMamba）。

Result: 在加拿大萨斯喀彻温省的MODIS时间序列数据集上评估，变化检测的平均F1得分比基线提高了约1.5-6%，LULC分类的OA、AA和Kappa指标提高了约2%。

Conclusion: KAMamba模型通过整合领域知识和先进架构，显著提升了MODIS变化检测和分类性能，为解决MODIS数据的关键挑战提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Although change detection using MODIS time series is critical for
environmental monitoring, it is a highly challenging task due to key MODIS
difficulties, e.g., mixed pixels, spatial-spectral-temporal information
coupling effect, and background class heterogeneity. This paper presents a
novel knowledge-aware Mamba (KAMamba) for enhanced MODIS change detection, with
the following contributions. First, to leverage knowledge regarding class
transitions, we design a novel knowledge-driven transition-matrix-guided
approach, leading to a knowledge-aware transition loss (KAT-loss) that can
enhance detection accuracies. Second, to improve model constraints, a
multi-task learning approach is designed, where three losses, i.e., pre-change
classification loss (PreC-loss), post-change classification loss (PostC-loss),
and change detection loss (Chg-loss) are used for improve model learning.
Third, to disentangle information coupling in MODIS time series, novel
spatial-spectral-temporal Mamba (SSTMamba) modules are designed. Last, to
improve Mamba model efficiency and remove computational cost, a sparse and
deformable Mamba (SDMamba) backbone is used in SSTMamba. On the MODIS
time-series dataset for Saskatchewan, Canada, we evaluate the method on
land-cover change detection and LULC classification; results show about 1.5-6%
gains in average F1 for change detection over baselines, and about 2%
improvements in OA, AA, and Kappa for LULC classification.

### [6] [A Framework for Low-Effort Training Data Generation for Urban Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11567)
*Denis Zavadski,Damjan Kalšan,Tim Küchler,Haebom Lee,Stefan Roth,Carsten Rother*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用扩散模型将合成数据集适配到真实目标域的新框架，仅需不完美的伪标签即可生成高质量、目标对齐的图像，显著提升分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据集与真实图像存在明显差距，特别是在特定目标域（如Cityscapes）中，这种差距限制了模型性能。传统方法需要昂贵的3D建模来缩小差距，违背了低成本标注数据的初衷。

Method: 使用现成的扩散模型，仅基于不完美的伪标签进行目标域适配训练。该方法过滤次优生成结果，修正图像-标签不对齐问题，并统一不同数据集的语义标注，将弱合成数据转化为具有竞争力的真实域训练集。

Result: 在五个合成数据集和两个真实目标数据集上的实验表明，分割性能比最先进的翻译方法提升了高达+8.0% mIoU，使快速构建的合成数据集能够达到需要大量人工设计的高质量合成数据集的效果。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了一种有价值的协作范式，即快速语义原型设计与生成模型相结合，能够为城市场景理解创建可扩展的高质量训练数据。

Abstract: Synthetic datasets are widely used for training urban scene recognition
models, but even highly realistic renderings show a noticeable gap to real
imagery. This gap is particularly pronounced when adapting to a specific target
domain, such as Cityscapes, where differences in architecture, vegetation,
object appearance, and camera characteristics limit downstream performance.
Closing this gap with more detailed 3D modelling would require expensive asset
and scene design, defeating the purpose of low-cost labelled data. To address
this, we present a new framework that adapts an off-the-shelf diffusion model
to a target domain using only imperfect pseudo-labels. Once trained, it
generates high-fidelity, target-aligned images from semantic maps of any
synthetic dataset, including low-effort sources created in hours rather than
months. The method filters suboptimal generations, rectifies image-label
misalignments, and standardises semantics across datasets, transforming weak
synthetic data into competitive real-domain training sets. Experiments on five
synthetic datasets and two real target datasets show segmentation gains of up
to +8.0%pt. mIoU over state-of-the-art translation methods, making rapidly
constructed synthetic datasets as effective as high-effort, time-intensive
synthetic datasets requiring extensive manual design. This work highlights a
valuable collaborative paradigm where fast semantic prototyping, combined with
generative models, enables scalable, high-quality training data creation for
urban scene understanding.

### [7] [NNDM: NN_UNet Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09681)
*Sashank Makanaboyina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出NNDM混合框架，结合NN-UNet的稳健特征提取和扩散概率模型的生成能力，通过迭代去噪过程提升脑肿瘤分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNN模型如U-Net在泛化能力、边界精度和数据多样性方面存在不足，需要改进脑肿瘤MRI分割的准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: 将扩散模型与NN-UNet集成，扩散模型学习预测分割掩码与真实掩码之间的残差误差分布，通过迭代去噪过程细化分割结果。

Result: 在BraTS 2021数据集上，NNDM相比传统U-Net和基于Transformer的基线方法，在Dice系数和Hausdorff距离指标上表现更优。

Conclusion: NNDM为结合确定性分割网络与随机扩散模型开辟了新方向，推进了自动脑肿瘤分析的技术水平。

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) are critical for effective diagnosis and treatment planning.
Despite advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as U-Net,
existing models often struggle with generalization, boundary precision, and
limited data diversity. To address these challenges, we propose NNDM (NN\_UNet
Diffusion Model)a hybrid framework that integrates the robust feature
extraction of NN-UNet with the generative capabilities of diffusion
probabilistic models. In our approach, the diffusion model progressively
refines the segmentation masks generated by NN-UNet by learning the residual
error distribution between predicted and ground-truth masks. This iterative
denoising process enables the model to correct fine structural inconsistencies
and enhance tumor boundary delineation. Experiments conducted on the BraTS 2021
datasets demonstrate that NNDM achieves superior performance compared to
conventional U-Net and transformer-based baselines, yielding improvements in
Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance metrics. Moreover, the diffusion-guided
refinement enhances robustness across modalities and tumor subregions. The
proposed NNDM establishes a new direction for combining deterministic
segmentation networks with stochastic diffusion models, advancing the state of
the art in automated brain tumor analysis.

*Thi Bich Phuong Man,Luu Tu Nguyen,Vu Tram Anh Khuong,Thanh Ha Le,Thi Duyen Ngo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新的微表情识别方法，通过两种互补表示（时间排序动态图像和运动强度动态图像）以及自适应融合网络，在多个基准数据集上取得最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情是细微、短暂的面部变化，强度极低，肉眼几乎无法察觉，但能揭示真实情绪，在测谎、行为分析和心理评估中具有重要价值。

Method: 提出两种互补表示：时间排序动态图像（强调时间进程）和运动强度动态图像（通过包含运动强度的帧重排机制突出细微运动）；提出自适应融合网络，自动学习最优整合这两种表示。

Result: 在CASME-II数据集上达到93.95%准确率和0.897 UF1，创下新纪录；在SAMM数据集上达到82.47%准确率和0.665 UF1，显示更平衡的类别识别；在MMEW数据集上达到76.00%准确率，验证了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 输入表示和提出的架构在提升微表情识别性能中都发挥重要作用，为情感计算、测谎和人机交互领域的进一步研究和实际应用提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are subtle, transient facial changes with very low
intensity, almost imperceptible to the naked eye, yet they reveal a person
genuine emotion. They are of great value in lie detection, behavioral analysis,
and psychological assessment. This paper proposes a novel MER method with two
main contributions. First, we propose two complementary representations -
Temporal-ranked dynamic image, which emphasizes temporal progression, and
Motion-intensity dynamic image, which highlights subtle motions through a frame
reordering mechanism incorporating motion intensity. Second, we propose an
Adaptive fusion network, which automatically learns to optimally integrate
these two representations, thereby enhancing discriminative ME features while
suppressing noise. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (CASME-II, SAMM and
MMEW) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. Specifically, AFN
achieves 93.95 Accuracy and 0.897 UF1 on CASME-II, setting a new
state-of-the-art benchmark. On SAMM, the method attains 82.47 Accuracy and
0.665 UF1, demonstrating more balanced recognition across classes. On MMEW, the
model achieves 76.00 Accuracy, further confirming its generalization ability.
The obtained results show that both the input and the proposed architecture
play important roles in improving the performance of MER. Moreover, they
provide a solid foundation for further research and practical applications in
the fields of affective computing, lie detection, and human-computer
interaction.

Abstract: Connected Vision Systems (CVS) are transforming a variety of applications,
including autonomous vehicles, smart cities, surveillance, and human-robot
interaction. These systems harness multi-view multi-camera (MVMC) data to
provide enhanced situational awareness through the integration of MVMC
tracking, re-identification (Re-ID), and action understanding (AU). However,
deploying CVS in real-world, dynamic environments presents a number of
challenges, particularly in addressing occlusions, diverse viewpoints, and
environmental variability. Existing surveys have focused primarily on isolated
tasks such as tracking, Re-ID, and AU, often neglecting their integration into
a cohesive system. These reviews typically emphasize single-view setups,
overlooking the complexities and opportunities provided by multi-camera
collaboration and multi-view data analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this
survey is the first to offer a comprehensive and integrated review of MVMC that
unifies MVMC tracking, Re-ID, and AU into a single framework. We propose a
unique taxonomy to better understand the critical components of CVS, dividing
it into four key parts: MVMC tracking, Re-ID, AU, and combined methods. We
systematically arrange and summarize the state-of-the-art datasets,
methodologies, results, and evaluation metrics, providing a structured view of
the field's progression. Furthermore, we identify and discuss the open research
questions and challenges, along with emerging technologies such as lifelong
learning, privacy, and federated learning, that need to be addressed for future
advancements. The paper concludes by outlining key research directions for
enhancing the robustness, efficiency, and adaptability of CVS in complex,
real-world applications. We hope this survey will inspire innovative solutions
and guide future research toward the next generation of intelligent and
adaptive CVS.

*Dwip Dalal,Gautam Vashishtha,Utkarsh Mishra,Jeonghwan Kim,Madhav Kanda,Hyeonjeong Ha,Svetlana Lazebnik,Heng Ji,Unnat Jain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttWarp是一种轻量级方法，通过多模态大语言模型的跨模态注意力对输入图像进行直线扭曲，重新分配空间分辨率到模型认为重要的区域，从而提升细粒度感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在复杂场景中经常错过小细节和空间关系，导致细粒度感知定位错误。

Method: 使用MLLM的跨模态注意力在测试时对输入图像进行直线扭曲，将空间分辨率重新分配到模型认为重要的区域，不改变模型权重或架构。

Result: 在五个基准测试和四个MLLM上，AttWarp持续提高准确性，增强组合推理能力，减少幻觉，优于四个竞争基线方法。

Conclusion: 注意力引导的扭曲优先处理与查询相关的信息同时保留上下文，相同的MLLM在接收这种扭曲输入时表现更好。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often miss small details and spatial
relations in cluttered scenes, leading to errors in fine-grained perceptual
grounding. We introduce AttWarp, a lightweight method that allocates more
resolution to query-relevant content while compressing less informative areas,
all while preserving global context. At test time, the approach uses an MLLM's
cross-modal attention to perform rectilinear warping of the input image,
reallocating spatial resolution toward regions the model deems important,
without changing model weights or architecture. This attention-guided warping
preserves all original image information but redistributes it non-uniformly, so
small objects and subtle relationships become easier for the same model to read
while the global layout remains intact. Across five benchmarks (TextVQA, GQA,
DocVQA, POPE, MMMU) and four MLLMs (LLaVA, Qwen-VL, InternVL, and
InstructBLIP), AttWarp consistently improves accuracy, strengthens
compositional reasoning, and reduces hallucinations, outperforming four
competitive baselines that manipulate raw images at test time. Together, these
results show that attention-guided warping prioritizes information relevant to
the query while preserving context, and that the same MLLMs perform better when
given such warped inputs.

Motivation: 探索外语学习者在多模态环境中推断陌生单词含义的能力，以及影响这种推断成功的数据特征和参与者语言背景。

Method: 通过人类参与者实验，使用不同的图像-文本配对，分析图像和文本特征对单词含义推断的影响，并研究AI系统预测参与者表现的能力。

Result: 发现只有部分直观特征与参与者表现有强相关性，需要进一步研究预测特征；AI系统在预测参与者表现方面显示出改进潜力。

Conclusion: 需要深入研究多模态外语学习中影响单词含义推断成功的预测特征，并为AI系统改进推理能力指明了有前景的方向。

Abstract: We investigate a new setting for foreign language learning, where learners
infer the meaning of unfamiliar words in a multimodal context of a sentence
describing a paired image. We conduct studies with human participants using
different image-text pairs. We analyze the features of the data (i.e., images
and texts) that make it easier for participants to infer the meaning of a
masked or unfamiliar word, and what language backgrounds of the participants
correlate with success. We find only some intuitive features have strong
correlations with participant performance, prompting the need for further
investigating of predictive features for success in these tasks. We also
analyze the ability of AI systems to reason about participant performance, and
discover promising future directions for improving this reasoning ability.

*Weiqing Luo,Zhen Tan,Yifan Li,Xinyu Zhao,Kwonjoon Lee,Behzad Dariush,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种自适应分辨率方法来解决视觉大语言模型在不同视觉语言任务中的分辨率偏好问题，通过分析图像复杂度和模型不确定性来确定最优分辨率，并开发了参数高效的微调技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉大语言模型通常预设固定分辨率，导致在不同视觉语言任务中性能不佳。现实应用需要不同粒度的感知能力，因此需要根据任务特性自适应选择最优分辨率。

Method: 首先通过分析图像复杂度和模型不确定性方差，提出经验公式确定各任务的最优分辨率；其次开发参数高效的微调技术，将预训练模型扩展到识别出的最优分辨率。

Result: 在各种视觉语言任务上的广泛实验验证了该方法的有效性，相比固定分辨率方法显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应分辨率方法能够有效解决视觉大语言模型在不同任务中的分辨率偏好问题，为实际应用提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world vision-language applications demand varying levels of perceptual
granularity. However, most existing visual large language models (VLLMs), such
as LLaVA, pre-assume a fixed resolution for downstream tasks, which leads to
subpar performance. To address this problem, we first conduct a comprehensive
and pioneering investigation into the resolution preferences of different
vision-language tasks, revealing a correlation between resolution preferences
with image complexity, and uncertainty variance of the VLLM at different image
input resolutions. Building on this insight, we propose an empirical formula to
determine the optimal resolution for a given vision-language task, combining
these two factors. Second, based on rigorous experiments, we propose a novel
parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique to extend the visual input resolution
of pre-trained VLLMs to the identified optimal resolution. Extensive
experiments on various vision-language tasks validate the effectiveness of our
method.

Result: 通过比较不同CRF方法在两个数据集上的表现，展示了各种方法的优缺点和潜力。

Conclusion: 研究发现某些CRF方法在图像分割中表现更好，为选择合适的CRF方法提供了指导。

Abstract: The output of image the segmentation process is usually not very clear due to
low quality features of Satellite images. The purpose of this study is to find
a suitable Conditional Random Field (CRF) to achieve better clarity in a
segmented image. We started with different types of CRFs and studied them as to
why they are or are not suitable for our purpose. We evaluated our approach on
two different datasets - Satellite imagery having low quality features and high
quality Aerial photographs. During the study we experimented with various CRFs
to find which CRF gives the best results on images and compared our results on
these datasets to show the pitfalls and potentials of different approaches.

*David Benavente-Rios,Juan Ruiz Rodriguez,Gustavo Gatica*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用合成人脸数据增强单形态攻击检测(S-MAD)，通过增量测试协议评估泛化能力，发现适度加入合成图像可改善性能，但仅使用合成数据效果最差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决由于隐私问题导致真实人脸图像数据集规模受限的问题，探索合成数据在S-MAD中的应用价值。

Method: 采用多种形态工具和跨数据集评估方案，实施增量测试协议来评估随着合成图像增加时的泛化能力。

Result: 适度加入合成图像可提升泛化能力，但过度使用会导致性能下降；仅使用合成数据时EER最高，效果最差。

Conclusion: 在S-MAD中应谨慎控制合成数据的使用量，不能完全依赖合成数据，最佳策略是适度结合真实和合成数据。

Abstract: This paper investigates the use of synthetic face data to enhance
Single-Morphing Attack Detection (S-MAD), addressing the limitations of
availability of large-scale datasets of bona fide images due to privacy
concerns. Various morphing tools and cross-dataset evaluation schemes were
utilized to conduct this study. An incremental testing protocol was implemented
to assess the generalization capabilities as more and more synthetic images
were added. The results of the experiments show that generalization can be
improved by carefully incorporating a controlled number of synthetic images
into existing datasets or by gradually adding bona fide images during training.
However, indiscriminate use of synthetic data can lead to sub-optimal
performance. Evenmore, the use of only synthetic data (morphed and non-morphed
images) achieves the highest Equal Error Rate (EER), which means in operational
scenarios the best option is not relying only on synthetic data for S-MAD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Ceb的新型细胞实例分割方法，通过利用细胞边界特征和标签来将前景像素划分为细胞实例，相比现有方法能更好地保留细胞的几何特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于深度学习的细胞实例分割方法主要关注像素级目标，但可能丢失细胞实例的重要几何特性（如形状、曲率、凸性等），这些特性需要像素集合才能表示。

Method: Ceb方法首先从语义分割概率图中提取前景-前景边界，为每个边界候选构建边界特征表示（边界签名），然后使用边界分类器预测其二元边界标签，最后基于预测的边界标签通过分割或合并相邻区域获得细胞实例。

Result: 在六个数据集上的广泛实验表明，Ceb在语义分割概率图上优于现有的像素聚类方法，并且与最先进的细胞实例分割方法相比具有高度竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: Ceb方法通过利用边界特征有效解决了像素级目标可能丢失几何特性的问题，在细胞实例分割任务中表现出色。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for cell instance segmentation are based on
deep learning (DL) semantic segmentation approaches, focusing on distinguishing
foreground pixels from background pixels. In order to identify cell instances
from foreground pixels (e.g., pixel clustering), most methods decompose
instance information into pixel-wise objectives, such as distances to
foreground-background boundaries (distance maps), heat gradients with the
center point as heat source (heat diffusion maps), and distances from the
center point to foreground-background boundaries with fixed angles (star-shaped
polygons). However, pixel-wise objectives may lose significant geometric
properties of the cell instances, such as shape, curvature, and convexity,
which require a collection of pixels to represent. To address this challenge,
we present a novel pixel clustering method, called Ceb (for Cell boundaries),
to leverage cell boundary features and labels to divide foreground pixels into
cell instances. Starting with probability maps generated from semantic
segmentation, Ceb first extracts potential foreground-foreground boundaries
with a revised Watershed algorithm. For each boundary candidate, a boundary
feature representation (called boundary signature) is constructed by sampling
pixels from the current foreground-foreground boundary as well as the
neighboring background-foreground boundaries. Next, a boundary classifier is
used to predict its binary boundary label based on the corresponding boundary
signature. Finally, cell instances are obtained by dividing or merging
neighboring regions based on the predicted boundary labels. Extensive
experiments on six datasets demonstrate that Ceb outperforms existing pixel
clustering methods on semantic segmentation probability maps. Moreover, Ceb
achieves highly competitive performance compared to SOTA cell instance
segmentation methods.

### [16] [Cluster-Aware Prompt Ensemble Learning for Few-Shot Vision-Language Model Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09867)
*Zhi Chen,Xin Yu,Xiaohui Tao,Yan Li,Zi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Cluster-Aware Prompt Ensemble Learning (CAPEL)框架，通过在分类logits空间而非特征空间进行集成，并引入聚类保持正则化和自适应提示权重技术，解决传统提示集成方法中特征平均导致的类别中心偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统提示集成方法通过平均文本特征来集成多个上下文提示，但这种方法会使得类别中心偏离真实的类别分布，导致次优结果。

Method: CAPEL框架将图像分类到多个类别聚类中，每个聚类由不同的提示表示；在分类logits空间而非特征空间进行集成；引入聚类保持正则化确保提示保持区分性；使用自适应提示权重技术动态调整有缺陷或模糊提示的注意力权重。

Result: 该方法能够更好地对齐视觉特征分布，保持上下文提示的聚类特性，确保提示保持区分性和专门化，防止坍缩到统一方向。

Conclusion: CAPEL框架通过改进提示集成策略，解决了传统方法中的类别中心偏移问题，在多样数据集和任务上实现了更鲁棒的性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve zero-shot transfer across
various tasks by pre-training on numerous image-text pairs. These models often
benefit from using an ensemble of context prompts to represent a class. Despite
being effective, conventional prompt ensembling that averages textual features
of context prompts often yields suboptimal results. This is because feature
averaging shifts the class centroids away from the true class distribution. To
address this issue, we propose the Cluster-Aware Prompt Ensemble Learning
(CAPEL) framework, which preserves the cluster nature of context prompts. CAPEL
classifies images into one of several class clusters, each represented by a
distinct prompt. Instead of ensembling prompts in the feature space, we perform
ensembling in the classification logits space, aligning better with the visual
feature distribution. To further optimize prompt fine-tuning while maintaining
cluster-specific discriminative power, we introduce a cluster-preserving
regularization term. This ensures that prompts remain distinct and specialized
for different clusters, preventing collapse into a uniform direction.
Additionally, we integrate an adaptive prompt weighting technique to
dynamically adjust the attention weights for flawed or ambiguous prompts,
ensuring robust performance across diverse datasets and tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种多目标跟踪方法，使用深度和掩码特征通过自监督编码器生成稳定的对象表示，作为额外的相似性线索与边界框IoU和重识别特征结合进行匹配，避免计算分割掩码IoU。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MOT方法依赖IoU进行关联，但在对象相似或遮挡时不可靠，且计算分割掩码IoU计算成本高。需要更稳定高效的对象表示方法。

Method: 融合深度和掩码特征，通过自监督编码器生成对象表示；使用零样本深度估计器和提示式视觉分割模型获取空间线索；将对象表示与边界框IoU、重识别特征结合进行匹配。

Result: 在具有非线性运动、遮挡和拥挤场景的挑战性基准测试（如SportsMOT和DanceTrack）中，方法优于TBD最先进方法；在简单线性运动基准测试（如MOT17）中达到竞争性性能。

Conclusion: 该方法首次使用自监督编码器细化分割掩码而不计算掩码IoU，在复杂场景中表现出色，同时保持跟踪检测模型的计算效率优势。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) methods often rely on Intersection-over-Union
(IoU) for association. However, this becomes unreliable when objects are
similar or occluded. Also, computing IoU for segmentation masks is
computationally expensive. In this work, we use segmentation masks to capture
object shapes, but we do not compute segmentation IoU. Instead, we fuse depth
and mask features and pass them through a compact encoder trained
self-supervised. This encoder produces stable object representations, which we
use as an additional similarity cue alongside bounding box IoU and
re-identification features for matching. We obtain depth maps from a zero-shot
depth estimator and object masks from a promptable visual segmentation model to
obtain fine-grained spatial cues. Our MOT method is the first to use the
self-supervised encoder to refine segmentation masks without computing masks
IoU. MOT can be divided into joint detection-ReID (JDR) and
tracking-by-detection (TBD) models. The latter are computationally more
efficient. Experiments of our TBD method on challenging benchmarks with
non-linear motion, occlusion, and crowded scenes, such as SportsMOT and
DanceTrack, show that our method outperforms the TBD state-of-the-art on most
metrics, while achieving competitive performance on simpler benchmarks with
linear motion, such as MOT17.

TL;DR: 提出了首个大规模用户生成HDR视频质量数据集CHUG，包含856个源视频和5,992个转码视频，收集了211,848个主观评分，填补了UGC-HDR视频质量评估的数据空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HDR-VQA数据集主要关注专业生成内容，缺乏对真实世界用户生成HDR视频中多样化失真情况的理解，需要专门针对UGC-HDR的质量评估数据集。

Method: 构建包含856个UGC-HDR源视频的数据集，通过多种分辨率和比特率转码模拟真实场景，总计5,992个视频，通过亚马逊Mechanical Turk进行大规模主观质量评分收集。

Result: 创建了首个大规模UGC-HDR视频质量数据集CHUG，包含大量主观评分数据，为分析UGC特定失真提供了基准。

Conclusion: CHUG数据集将推动无参考HDR-VQA研究的发展，提供了大规模、多样化的真实世界UGC数据集资源。

Abstract: High Dynamic Range (HDR) videos enhance visual experiences with superior
brightness, contrast, and color depth. The surge of User-Generated Content
(UGC) on platforms like YouTube and TikTok introduces unique challenges for HDR
video quality assessment (VQA) due to diverse capture conditions, editing
artifacts, and compression distortions. Existing HDR-VQA datasets primarily
focus on professionally generated content (PGC), leaving a gap in understanding
real-world UGC-HDR degradations. To address this, we introduce CHUG:
Crowdsourced User-Generated HDR Video Quality Dataset, the first large-scale
subjective study on UGC-HDR quality. CHUG comprises 856 UGC-HDR source videos,
transcoded across multiple resolutions and bitrates to simulate real-world
scenarios, totaling 5,992 videos. A large-scale study via Amazon Mechanical
Turk collected 211,848 perceptual ratings. CHUG provides a benchmark for
analyzing UGC-specific distortions in HDR videos. We anticipate CHUG will
advance No-Reference (NR) HDR-VQA research by offering a large-scale, diverse,
and real-world UGC dataset. The dataset is publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 室内场景通常具有不规则布局、复杂结构和遮挡问题，现有方法采用均匀基函数布置效率低下，需要更智能的资源分配策略。

Method: 利用几何先验指导基函数的最优布置，记录观测统计信息，并引入场景自适应虚拟视点来补偿输入轨迹中的几何缺陷。

Result: 在多个大规模室内场景中，相比采用规则布置的基线方法，渲染质量和内存需求均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 场景自适应策略能够有效利用有限资源，通过几何指导优化表示容量分配，为室内环境的沉浸式体验生成提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose scene-adaptive strategies to efficiently allocate representation
capacity for generating immersive experiences of indoor environments from
incomplete observations. Indoor scenes with multiple rooms often exhibit
irregular layouts with varying complexity, containing clutter, occlusion, and
flat walls. We maximize the utilization of limited resources with guidance from
geometric priors, which are often readily available after pre-processing
stages. We record observation statistics on the estimated geometric scaffold
and guide the optimal placement of bases, which greatly improves upon the
uniform basis arrangements adopted by previous scalable Neural Radiance Field
(NeRF) representations. We also suggest scene-adaptive virtual viewpoints to
compensate for geometric deficiencies inherent in view configurations in the
input trajectory and impose the necessary regularization. We present a
comprehensive analysis and discussion regarding rendering quality and memory
requirements in several large-scale indoor scenes, demonstrating significant
enhancements compared to baselines that employ regular placements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日常环境捕捉面临频繁场景变化的挑战，需要密集的空间和时间观测。现有方法难以处理稀疏捕捉下的长期场景变化。

Method: 使用高斯泼溅表示，构建对象模板高斯作为结构先验，通过少样本观察对模板进行细化以适应时间变化环境，支持多时间步的简单变换。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上验证，相比基线方法获得更优的重建质量，同时实现快速轻量级更新。

Conclusion: LTGS框架能够有效处理长期场景变化，显著提升3D环境时间演化的可扩展性，适用于稀疏捕捉的日常环境重建。

Abstract: Recent advances in novel-view synthesis can create the photo-realistic
visualization of real-world environments from conventional camera captures.
However, acquiring everyday environments from casual captures faces challenges
due to frequent scene changes, which require dense observations both spatially
and temporally. We propose long-term Gaussian scene chronology from sparse-view
updates, coined LTGS, an efficient scene representation that can embrace
everyday changes from highly under-constrained casual captures. Given an
incomplete and unstructured Gaussian splatting representation obtained from an
initial set of input images, we robustly model the long-term chronology of the
scene despite abrupt movements and subtle environmental variations. We
construct objects as template Gaussians, which serve as structural, reusable
priors for shared object tracks. Then, the object templates undergo a further
refinement pipeline that modulates the priors to adapt to temporally varying
environments based on few-shot observations. Once trained, our framework is
generalizable across multiple time steps through simple transformations,
significantly enhancing the scalability for a temporal evolution of 3D
environments. As existing datasets do not explicitly represent the long-term
real-world changes with a sparse capture setup, we collect real-world datasets
to evaluate the practicality of our pipeline. Experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to other baselines
while enabling fast and light-weight updates.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个综合的多视角姿态估计框架，结合新颖的训练和后处理技术，通过模型蒸馏产生更高效有效的姿态估计器，在有限标注数据下实现准确跟踪和更好的不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多视角姿态估计方法在有限标注数据下难以实现准确跟踪，且不确定性估计效果不佳，这限制了动物行为量化分析的科学应用。

Method: 开发了多视角transformer(MVT)，利用预训练骨干网络同时处理所有视角信息；提出补丁掩码方案学习跨视角对应关系；引入3D增强和三角化损失确保几何一致性；扩展非线性集成卡尔曼平滑器(EKS)并增强不确定性量化；设计蒸馏程序利用改进的EKS预测生成高质量伪标签。

Conclusion: 该框架为现实世界数据约束下的下游行为分析提供了可靠的多视角姿态估计解决方案，显著减少了对人工标注的依赖。

Abstract: Multi-view pose estimation is essential for quantifying animal behavior in
scientific research, yet current methods struggle to achieve accurate tracking
with limited labeled data and suffer from poor uncertainty estimates. We
address these challenges with a comprehensive framework combining novel
training and post-processing techniques, and a model distillation procedure
that leverages the strengths of these techniques to produce a more efficient
and effective pose estimator. Our multi-view transformer (MVT) utilizes
pretrained backbones and enables simultaneous processing of information across
all views, while a novel patch masking scheme learns robust cross-view
correspondences without camera calibration. For calibrated setups, we
incorporate geometric consistency through 3D augmentation and a triangulation
loss. We extend the existing Ensemble Kalman Smoother (EKS) post-processor to
the nonlinear case and enhance uncertainty quantification via a variance
inflation technique. Finally, to leverage the scaling properties of the MVT, we
design a distillation procedure that exploits improved EKS predictions and
uncertainty estimates to generate high-quality pseudo-labels, thereby reducing
dependence on manual labels. Our framework components consistently outperform
existing methods across three diverse animal species (flies, mice, chickadees),
with each component contributing complementary benefits. The result is a
practical, uncertainty-aware system for reliable pose estimation that enables
downstream behavioral analyses under real-world data constraints.

Abstract: The relevance of this research lies in the growing demand for unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) capable of operating reliably in complex environments where
conventional navigation becomes unreliable due to interference, poor
visibility, or camouflage. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides unique
opportunities for UAV-based computer vision by enabling fine-grained material
recognition and object differentiation, which are critical for navigation,
surveillance, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. The aim of this work
is to develop a deep learning architecture integrating HSI into UAV perception
for navigation, object detection, and terrain classification. Objectives
include: reviewing existing HSI methods, designing a hybrid 2D/3D convolutional
architecture with spectral-spatial cross-attention, training, and benchmarking.
The methodology is based on the modification of the Mobile 3D Vision
Transformer (MDvT) by introducing the proposed SpectralCA block. This block
employs bi-directional cross-attention to fuse spectral and spatial features,
enhancing accuracy while reducing parameters and inference time. Experimental
evaluation was conducted on the WHU-Hi-HongHu dataset, with results assessed
using Overall Accuracy, Average Accuracy, and the Kappa coefficient. The
findings confirm that the proposed architecture improves UAV perception
efficiency, enabling real-time operation for navigation, object recognition,
and environmental monitoring tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了HeadsUp模型，一种单步扩散模型，专门用于肖像图像超分辨率，能够端到端地无缝恢复和放大肖像图像，解决了现有方法在面部区域处理时产生的边界伪影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像超分辨率技术要么专注于通用真实世界图像，要么专注于严格对齐的面部图像。在处理肖像照片时，需要混合使用不同模型，但这种方法会因不同模型的训练方法差异而在面部区域周围引入混合或边界伪影。

Method: 基于单步扩散模型构建，开发了面部监督机制来引导模型关注面部区域，并集成了基于参考的机制来帮助身份恢复，减少低质量面部恢复中的面部模糊。还构建了高质量的4K肖像图像超分辨率数据集PortraitSR-4K。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，HeadsUp在肖像图像超分辨率任务上达到了最先进的性能，同时在通用图像和对齐面部数据集上保持相当或更高的性能。

Conclusion: HeadsUp模型能够有效解决肖像图像超分辨率问题，通过端到端的方式无缝恢复和放大肖像图像，避免了混合方法带来的边界伪影问题。

Abstract: Portrait pictures, which typically feature both human subjects and natural
backgrounds, are one of the most prevalent forms of photography on social
media. Existing image super-resolution (ISR) techniques generally focus either
on generic real-world images or strictly aligned facial images (i.e., face
super-resolution). In practice, separate models are blended to handle portrait
photos: the face specialist model handles the face region, and the general
model processes the rest. However, these blending approaches inevitably
introduce blending or boundary artifacts around the facial regions due to
different model training recipes, while human perception is particularly
sensitive to facial fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we study the
portrait image supersolution (PortraitISR) problem, and propose HeadsUp, a
single-step diffusion model that is capable of seamlessly restoring and
upscaling portrait images in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we build our
model on top of a single-step diffusion model and develop a face supervision
mechanism to guide the model in focusing on the facial region. We then
integrate a reference-based mechanism to help with identity restoration,
reducing face ambiguity in low-quality face restoration. Additionally, we have
built a high-quality 4K portrait image ISR dataset dubbed PortraitSR-4K, to
support model training and benchmarking for portrait images. Extensive
experiments show that HeadsUp achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
PortraitISR task while maintaining comparable or higher performance on both
general image and aligned face datasets.

Conclusion: 提出的去噪扩散模型和Controlnet结合的方法能有效克服现有水下图像数据集的局限性，为海洋环境监测和研究提供更高质量的数据支持。

Abstract: Underwater images play a crucial role in ocean research and marine
environmental monitoring since they provide quality information about the
ecosystem. However, the complex and remote nature of the environment results in
poor image quality with issues such as low visibility, blurry textures, color
distortion, and noise. In recent years, research in image enhancement has
proven to be effective but also presents its own limitations, like poor
generalization and heavy reliance on clean datasets. One of the challenges
herein is the lack of diversity and the low quality of images included in these
datasets. Also, most existing datasets consist only of monocular images, a fact
that limits the representation of different lighting conditions and angles. In
this paper, we propose a new plan of action to overcome these limitations. On
one hand, we call for expanding the datasets using a denoising diffusion model
to include a variety of image types such as stereo, wide-angled, macro, and
close-up images. On the other hand, we recommend enhancing the images using
Controlnet to evaluate and increase the quality of the corresponding datasets,
and hence improve the study of the marine ecosystem.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于隐式神经表示（INR）的新方法，用于从纵向MRI数据中建模大脑衰老轨迹，通过将离散的神经影像数据表示为连续函数来解决传统深度学习方法在处理不规则采样数据时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类大脑在整个生命周期中经历动态的结构变化，纵向MRI数据对于表征典型和非典型衰老轨迹很有价值。但由于数据的离散性和不同时空采样模式，传统深度学习方法难以表示潜在的连续生物过程。

Method: 开发了一种新颖的INR架构，能够部分解耦空间和时间轨迹参数，并设计了一个直接在INR参数空间上操作的框架来分类大脑衰老轨迹。使用生物基础轨迹模拟生成450名健康和痴呆样受试者的3D MRI数据。

Result: 在不规则采样实验中，基于INR的方法在脑衰老轨迹分类任务中达到81.3%的准确率，优于标准深度学习基线模型（73.7%）。

Conclusion: INR方法能够有效处理纵向神经影像数据的不规则采样问题，为大脑衰老轨迹建模提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: The human brain undergoes dynamic, potentially pathology-driven, structural
changes throughout a lifespan. Longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
and other neuroimaging data are valuable for characterizing trajectories of
change associated with typical and atypical aging. However, the analysis of
such data is highly challenging given their discrete nature with different
spatial and temporal image sampling patterns within individuals and across
populations. This leads to computational problems for most traditional deep
learning methods that cannot represent the underlying continuous biological
process. To address these limitations, we present a new, fully data-driven
method for representing aging trajectories across the entire brain by modelling
subject-specific longitudinal T1-weighted MRI data as continuous functions
using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Therefore, we introduce a novel
INR architecture capable of partially disentangling spatial and temporal
trajectory parameters and design an efficient framework that directly operates
on the INRs' parameter space to classify brain aging trajectories. To evaluate
our method in a controlled data environment, we develop a biologically grounded
trajectory simulation and generate T1-weighted 3D MRI data for 450 healthy and
dementia-like subjects at regularly and irregularly sampled timepoints. In the
more realistic irregular sampling experiment, our INR-based method achieves
81.3% accuracy for the brain aging trajectory classification task,
outperforming a standard deep learning baseline model (73.7%).

Conclusion: 该框架为研究人员和从业者提供了构建准确、鲁棒、数据高效且适应实际领域的分割系统的实用方法

Abstract: Segmentation models achieve high accuracy on benchmarks but often fail in
real-world domains by relying on spurious correlations instead of true object
boundaries. We propose a human-in-the-loop interactive framework that enables
interventional learning through targeted human corrections of segmentation
outputs. Our approach treats human corrections as interventional signals that
show when reliance on superficial features (e.g., color or texture) is
inappropriate. The system learns from these interventions by propagating
correction-informed edits across visually similar images, effectively steering
the model toward robust, semantically meaningful features rather than
dataset-specific artifacts. Unlike traditional annotation approaches that
simply provide more training data, our method explicitly identifies when and
why the model fails and then systematically corrects these failure modes across
the entire dataset. Through iterative human feedback, the system develops
increasingly robust representations that generalize better to novel domains and
resist artifactual correlations. We demonstrate that our framework improves
segmentation accuracy by up to 9 mIoU points (12-15\% relative improvement) on

Abstract: As a specialty agricultural product with a large market scale, Shatian pomelo
necessitates the adoption of automated detection to ensure accurate quantity
and meet commercial demands for lean production. Existing research often
involves specialized networks tailored for specific theoretical or dataset
scenarios, but these methods tend to degrade performance in real-world. Through
analysis of factors in this issue, this study identifies four key challenges
that affect the accuracy of Shatian pomelo detection: imaging devices, lighting
conditions, object scale variation, and occlusion. To mitigate these
challenges, a multi-strategy framework is proposed in this paper. Firstly, to
effectively solve tone variation introduced by diverse imaging devices and
complex orchard environments, we utilize a multi-scenario dataset,
STP-AgriData, which is constructed by integrating real orchard images with
internet-sourced data. Secondly, to simulate the inconsistent illumination
conditions, specific data augmentations such as adjusting contrast and changing
brightness, are applied to the above dataset. Thirdly, to address the issues of
object scale variation and occlusion in fruit detection, an REAS-Det network is
designed in this paper. For scale variation, RFAConv and C3RFEM modules are
designed to expand and enhance the receptive fields. For occlusion variation, a
multi-scale, multi-head feature selection structure (MultiSEAM) and soft-NMS
are introduced to enhance the handling of occlusion issues to improve detection
accuracy. The results of these experiments achieved a precision(P) of 87.6%, a
recall (R) of 74.9%, a mAP@.50 of 82.8%, and a mAP@.50:.95 of 53.3%. Our
proposed network demonstrates superior performance compared to other
state-of-the-art detection methods.

TL;DR: 提出J-RAS方法，通过联合训练分割模型和检索模型，利用检索到的图像-掩码对增强分割性能，在多个数据集和架构上实现显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗图像分割中人工标注耗时且存在差异，以及AI方法需要大量标注数据和泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 联合训练分割模型和检索模型，使分割模型能够利用检索到的图像-掩码对增强解剖理解，检索模型学习分割相关特征。

Result: 在ACDC数据集上，SegFormer结合J-RAS将Dice分数从0.8708提升到0.9115，Hausdorff距离从1.8130降低到1.1489。

Conclusion: J-RAS方法有效提升了分割性能，具有良好的通用性和架构适应性。

Abstract: Image segmentation, the process of dividing images into meaningful regions,
is critical in medical applications for accurate diagnosis, treatment planning,
and disease monitoring. Although manual segmentation by healthcare
professionals produces precise outcomes, it is time-consuming, costly, and
prone to variability due to differences in human expertise. Artificial
intelligence (AI)-based methods have been developed to address these
limitations by automating segmentation tasks; however, they often require
large, annotated datasets that are rarely available in practice and frequently
struggle to generalize across diverse imaging conditions due to inter-patient
variability and rare pathological cases. In this paper, we propose Joint
Retrieval Augmented Segmentation (J-RAS), a joint training method for guided
image segmentation that integrates a segmentation model with a retrieval model.
Both models are jointly optimized, enabling the segmentation model to leverage
retrieved image-mask pairs to enrich its anatomical understanding, while the
retrieval model learns segmentation-relevant features beyond simple visual
similarity. This joint optimization ensures that retrieval actively contributes
meaningful contextual cues to guide boundary delineation, thereby enhancing the
overall segmentation performance. We validate J-RAS across multiple
segmentation backbones, including U-Net, TransUNet, SAM, and SegFormer, on two
benchmark datasets: ACDC and M&Ms, demonstrating consistent improvements. For
example, on the ACDC dataset, SegFormer without J-RAS achieves a mean Dice
score of 0.8708$\pm$0.042 and a mean Hausdorff Distance (HD) of
1.8130$\pm$2.49, whereas with J-RAS, the performance improves substantially to
a mean Dice score of 0.9115$\pm$0.031 and a mean HD of 1.1489$\pm$0.30. These
results highlight the method's effectiveness and its generalizability across
architectures and datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于AI的端到端框架，利用现有交通摄像头进行大规模高分辨率交通监控，通过YOLOv11模型提取交通指标，图基视角归一化处理动态摄像头，集成大语言模型自动生成交通模式总结，在纽约拥堵收费政策实施期间验证了系统有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统交通传感器部署成本高昂，而现有视频分析技术难以处理大规模摄像头网络的动态视角和海量数据，需要一种成本效益高且可扩展的交通监控解决方案。

Method: 使用微调YOLOv11模型实时提取多模态交通密度和分类指标；提出图基视角归一化方法处理非固定PTZ摄像头的不一致性；集成领域特定大语言模型处理海量视频数据并生成自动化总结。

Result: 在纽约拥堵收费政策早期实施期间，系统分析了900多万张图像，显示拥堵缓解区内工作日乘用车密度下降9%，卡车流量早期减少但出现反弹迹象，行人和自行车活动在走廊和区域尺度上持续增加。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了作为实用、基础设施就绪的解决方案的潜力，能够以最小人工干预进行大规模、政策相关的交通监控。

Abstract: Accurate, scalable traffic monitoring is critical for real-time and long-term
transportation management, particularly during disruptions such as natural
disasters, large construction projects, or major policy changes like New York
City's first-in-the-nation congestion pricing program. However, widespread
sensor deployment remains limited due to high installation, maintenance, and
data management costs. While traffic cameras offer a cost-effective
alternative, existing video analytics struggle with dynamic camera viewpoints
and massive data volumes from large camera networks. This study presents an
end-to-end AI-based framework leveraging existing traffic camera infrastructure
for high-resolution, longitudinal analysis at scale. A fine-tuned YOLOv11
model, trained on localized urban scenes, extracts multimodal traffic density
and classification metrics in real time. To address inconsistencies from
non-stationary pan-tilt-zoom cameras, we introduce a novel graph-based
viewpoint normalization method. A domain-specific large language model was also
integrated to process massive data from a 24/7 video stream to generate
frequent, automated summaries of evolving traffic patterns, a task far
exceeding manual capabilities. We validated the system using over 9 million
images from roughly 1,000 traffic cameras during the early rollout of NYC
congestion pricing in 2025. Results show a 9% decline in weekday passenger
vehicle density within the Congestion Relief Zone, early truck volume
reductions with signs of rebound, and consistent increases in pedestrian and
cyclist activity at corridor and zonal scales. Experiments showed that
example-based prompts improved LLM's numerical accuracy and reduced
hallucinations. These findings demonstrate the framework's potential as a
practical, infrastructure-ready solution for large-scale, policy-relevant
traffic monitoring with minimal human intervention.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理原理的镜头光晕数据生成方法FlareX，包含2D和3D混合数据集，有效解决了现有合成数据缺乏多样性和物理真实性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有镜头光晕数据集通常通过将人工光晕模板叠加到背景图像上来合成，但模板缺乏多样性且忽略物理原理，导致训练模型在真实场景中泛化能力差。

Method: 采用三阶段物理信息方法：参数化模板创建、光照规律感知的2D合成、基于物理引擎的3D渲染，最终生成包含2D和3D视角的混合数据集FlareX。

Result: 构建了包含9,500个2D模板（来自95种光晕模式）和3,000个光晕图像对（来自60个3D场景）的数据集，并通过掩码方法获取真实世界无光晕图像用于模型评估。

Conclusion: 大量实验证明了所提方法和数据集的有效性，能够显著提升模型在真实场景中的性能表现。

Abstract: Lens flare occurs when shooting towards strong light sources, significantly
degrading the visual quality of images. Due to the difficulty in capturing
flare-corrupted and flare-free image pairs in the real world, existing datasets
are typically synthesized in 2D by overlaying artificial flare templates onto
background images. However, the lack of flare diversity in templates and the
neglect of physical principles in the synthesis process hinder models trained
on these datasets from generalizing well to real-world scenarios. To address
these challenges, we propose a new physics-informed method for flare data
generation, which consists of three stages: parameterized template creation,
the laws of illumination-aware 2D synthesis, and physical engine-based 3D
rendering, which finally gives us a mixed flare dataset that incorporates both
2D and 3D perspectives, namely FlareX. This dataset offers 9,500 2D templates
derived from 95 flare patterns and 3,000 flare image pairs rendered from 60 3D
scenes. Furthermore, we design a masking approach to obtain real-world
flare-free images from their corrupted counterparts to measure the performance
of the model on real-world images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method and dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了BurstDeflicker数据集，通过三种互补的数据采集策略解决闪烁伪影去除研究中缺乏大规模真实数据集的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 滚动快门相机与交流电照明之间的相互作用导致短曝光图像中出现闪烁伪影，表现为不均匀的亮度分布和暗带。这些伪影不仅影响图像质量，还影响物体检测和跟踪等高级任务。缺乏大规模真实数据集是闪烁去除研究的主要障碍。

Method: 1. 开发基于Retinex的合成流水线，可控制关键闪烁属性；2. 从不同场景捕获4000张真实闪烁图像；3. 提出绿屏方法在图像对中引入运动同时保留真实闪烁退化。

Result: 构建了BurstDeflicker基准数据集，综合实验证明了数据集的有效性。

Conclusion: 该数据集具有推进闪烁去除研究的潜力，通过三种互补策略解决了数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: Flicker artifacts in short-exposure images are caused by the interplay
between the row-wise exposure mechanism of rolling shutter cameras and the
temporal intensity variations of alternating current (AC)-powered lighting.
These artifacts typically appear as uneven brightness distribution across the
image, forming noticeable dark bands. Beyond compromising image quality, this
structured noise also affects high-level tasks, such as object detection and
tracking, where reliable lighting is crucial. Despite the prevalence of
flicker, the lack of a large-scale, realistic dataset has been a significant
barrier to advancing research in flicker removal. To address this issue, we
present BurstDeflicker, a scalable benchmark constructed using three
complementary data acquisition strategies. First, we develop a Retinex-based
synthesis pipeline that redefines the goal of flicker removal and enables
controllable manipulation of key flicker-related attributes (e.g., intensity,
area, and frequency), thereby facilitating the generation of diverse flicker
patterns. Second, we capture 4,000 real-world flicker images from different
scenes, which help the model better understand the spatial and temporal
characteristics of real flicker artifacts and generalize more effectively to
wild scenarios. Finally, due to the non-repeatable nature of dynamic scenes, we
propose a green-screen method to incorporate motion into image pairs while
preserving real flicker degradation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our dataset and its potential to advance research in flicker
removal.

TL;DR: 提出了MIMO模型，解决医疗视觉语言模型的两个问题：输入缺乏对图像视觉线索的直接理解，输出缺乏与图像关键区域的连接。模型具有视觉参考的多模态输入和像素定位的多模态输出能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗视觉语言模型存在两个主要问题：输入仅依赖文本指令而缺乏对图像视觉线索的直接理解；输出仅提供文本答案而缺乏与图像关键区域的连接。

Method: 提出统一的医疗视觉语言模型MIMO，具有视觉参考的多模态输入和像素定位的多模态输出。构建了包含89.5万样本的MIMOSeg数据集，从四个不同角度覆盖基础指令跟随和复杂问答任务。

Result: 在多个下游医疗多模态任务上的实验验证了MIMO能够独特地结合视觉参考和像素定位能力，这是先前模型所不具备的。

Conclusion: MIMO模型成功解决了医疗视觉语言模型在输入和输出方面的局限性，通过多模态输入输出实现了对医疗图像的更好理解和语义连接。

Abstract: Currently, medical vision language models are widely used in medical vision
question answering tasks. However, existing models are confronted with two
issues: for input, the model only relies on text instructions and lacks direct
understanding of visual clues in the image; for output, the model only gives
text answers and lacks connection with key areas in the image. To address these
issues, we propose a unified medical vision language model MIMO, with visual
referring Multimodal Input and pixel grounding Multimodal Output. MIMO can not
only combine visual clues and textual instructions to understand complex
medical images and semantics, but can also ground medical terminologies in
textual output within the image. To overcome the scarcity of relevant data in
the medical field, we propose MIMOSeg, a comprehensive medical multimodal
dataset including 895K samples. MIMOSeg is constructed from four different
perspectives, covering basic instruction following and complex question
answering with multimodal input and multimodal output. We conduct experiments
on several downstream medical multimodal tasks. Extensive experimental results
verify that MIMO can uniquely combine visual referring and pixel grounding
capabilities, which are not available in previous models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Query-Adapter（Q-Adapter），一种轻量级视觉适配器模块，通过引入可学习查询令牌和门控层来增强多模态大语言模型，在视频字幕任务中实现高效微调，仅需1.4%参数即可达到与全微调方法竞争的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法主要关注多模态大语言模型的语言组件，在视觉信息理解和多模态任务中探索不足，且随着模型规模增大，全模型微调变得计算成本过高。

Method: Q-Adapter在视觉编码器中引入可学习查询令牌和门控层，无需外部文本监督即可有效提取稀疏的、与字幕相关的特征。

Result: 在MSR-VTT和MSVD数据集上，Q-Adapter在BLEU@4、METEOR、ROUGE-L和CIDEr指标上均达到参数高效微调方法中的最先进性能，且仅需1.4%参数即可与全微调方法竞争。

Conclusion: Q-Adapter在平衡字幕质量和参数效率方面具有强大潜力，展示了其在视频语言建模中的可扩展性。

Abstract: Recent advances in video captioning are driven by large-scale pretrained
models, which follow the standard "pre-training followed by fine-tuning"
paradigm, where the full model is fine-tuned for downstream tasks. Although
effective, this approach becomes computationally prohibitive as the model size
increases. The Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approach offers a
promising alternative, but primarily focuses on the language components of
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Despite recent progress, PEFT remains
underexplored in multimodal tasks and lacks sufficient understanding of visual
information during fine-tuning the model. To bridge this gap, we propose
Query-Adapter (Q-Adapter), a lightweight visual adapter module designed to
enhance MLLMs by enabling efficient fine-tuning for the video captioning task.
Q-Adapter introduces learnable query tokens and a gating layer into Vision
Encoder, enabling effective extraction of sparse, caption-relevant features
without relying on external textual supervision. We evaluate Q-Adapter on two
well-known video captioning datasets, MSR-VTT and MSVD, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance among the methods that take the PEFT approach
across BLEU@4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr metrics. Q-Adapter also achieves
competitive performance compared to methods that take the full fine-tuning
approach while requiring only 1.4% of the parameters. We further analyze the
impact of key hyperparameters and design choices on fine-tuning effectiveness,
providing insights into optimization strategies for adapter-based learning.
These results highlight the strong potential of Q-Adapter in balancing caption
quality and parameter efficiency, demonstrating its scalability for
video-language modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: P-4DGS是一种新型动态3D高斯泼溅表示方法，通过空间-时间预测模块和自适应量化策略，显著降低了动态场景重建的存储需求，在保持高质量重建的同时实现高达40-90倍的压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态3DGS算法忽略了动态场景中固有的时间和空间冗余，导致内存消耗过高，需要一种更紧凑的4D场景建模方法。

Method: 设计基于3D锚点的空间-时间预测模块来利用3D高斯基元间的时空相关性，结合自适应量化和基于上下文的熵编码进一步压缩3D锚点。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上的实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的重建质量和最快的渲染速度，平均存储占用仅约1MB，在合成和真实场景上分别达到40倍和90倍的压缩。

Conclusion: P-4DGS通过有效的时空冗余利用和压缩技术，为动态3D场景重建提供了一种高效且紧凑的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered significant attention due to its
superior scene representation fidelity and real-time rendering performance,
especially for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction (\textit{i.e.}, 4D
reconstruction). However, despite achieving promising results, most existing
algorithms overlook the substantial temporal and spatial redundancies inherent
in dynamic scenes, leading to prohibitive memory consumption. To address this,
we propose P-4DGS, a novel dynamic 3DGS representation for compact 4D scene
modeling. Inspired by intra- and inter-frame prediction techniques commonly
used in video compression, we first design a 3D anchor point-based
spatial-temporal prediction module to fully exploit the spatial-temporal
correlations across different 3D Gaussian primitives. Subsequently, we employ
an adaptive quantization strategy combined with context-based entropy coding to
further reduce the size of the 3D anchor points, thereby achieving enhanced
compression efficiency. To evaluate the rate-distortion performance of our
proposed P-4DGS in comparison with other dynamic 3DGS representations, we
conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
reconstruction quality and the fastest rendering speed, with a remarkably low
storage footprint (around \textbf{1MB} on average), achieving up to
\textbf{40$\times$} and \textbf{90$\times$} compression on synthetic and
real-world scenes, respectively.

TL;DR: 提出了CCFormer框架，通过早期集成模块、多查询Transformer模块和双模态对比学习，有效处理音频-视觉分割任务，在多个数据集上达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN方法受限于局部感受野，而基于Transformer的方法难以充分提取多模态系数和时序动态。需要一种能同时处理局部和全局信息、捕捉时空上下文的方法。

Method: CCFormer包含三个核心模块：早期集成模块（并行双边架构融合多尺度视觉特征和音频数据）、多查询Transformer模块（动态赋予音频查询学习能力，同时建模帧级和视频级关系）、双模态对比学习（在统一特征空间促进跨模态对齐）。

Result: 在S4、MS3和AVSS数据集上均创下了新的最先进基准。

Conclusion: CCFormer通过有效结合局部和全局信息处理、时空上下文捕捉以及跨模态对齐，显著提升了音频-视觉分割性能。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to generate pixel-wise segmentation maps
that correlate with the auditory signals of objects. This field has seen
significant progress with numerous CNN and Transformer-based methods enhancing
the segmentation accuracy and robustness. Traditional CNN approaches manage
audio-visual interactions through basic operations like padding and
multiplications but are restricted by CNNs' limited local receptive field. More
recently, Transformer-based methods treat auditory cues as queries, utilizing
attention mechanisms to enhance audio-visual cooperation within frames.
Nevertheless, they typically struggle to extract multimodal coefficients and
temporal dynamics adequately. To overcome these limitations, we present the
Complementary and Contrastive Transformer (CCFormer), a novel framework adept
at processing both local and global information and capturing spatial-temporal
context comprehensively. Our CCFormer initiates with the Early Integration
Module (EIM) that employs a parallel bilateral architecture, merging
multi-scale visual features with audio data to boost cross-modal
complementarity. To extract the intra-frame spatial features and facilitate the
perception of temporal coherence, we introduce the Multi-query Transformer
Module (MTM), which dynamically endows audio queries with learning capabilities
and models the frame and video-level relations simultaneously. Furthermore, we
propose the Bi-modal Contrastive Learning (BCL) to promote the alignment across
both modalities in the unified feature space. Through the effective combination
of those designs, our method sets new state-of-the-art benchmarks across the
S4, MS3 and AVSS datasets. Our source code and model weights will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/SitongGong/CCFormer

TL;DR: ViTAR是一个模仿人类专家迭代推理过程的医学视觉语言模型框架，通过"思考-行动-再思考-回答"的认知链进行多步骤视觉推理，在医学诊断任务中优于现有最先进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学视觉语言模型通常依赖单次推理，忽略了局部视觉线索，而人类专家在临床实践中会迭代扫描、聚焦和细化感兴趣区域。为了缩小机器与人类感知差距，需要模拟人类专家的迭代推理过程。

Method: 提出ViTAR框架，将医学图像视为交互对象，通过"思考-行动-再思考-回答"认知链进行多步骤视觉推理。构建了包含1K交互示例的高质量指令数据集和16K视觉问答训练数据。采用两阶段训练策略：先进行监督微调引导认知轨迹，然后使用强化学习优化决策。

Result: 广泛评估表明ViTAR优于现有最先进模型。视觉注意力分析显示，从"思考"到"再思考"阶段，ViTAR逐渐将视觉基础锚定到临床关键区域，并在推理过程中保持对视觉标记的高注意力分配。

Conclusion: 将专家风格的迭代思维链嵌入视觉语言模型可以增强医学AI的性能和可信度。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image-text understanding but
typically rely on a single-pass reasoning that neglects localized visual cues.
In clinical practice, however, human experts iteratively scan, focus, and
refine the regions of interest before reaching a final diagnosis. To narrow
this machine-human perception gap, we introduce ViTAR, a novel VLM framework
that emulates the iterative reasoning process of human experts through a
cognitive chain of "think-act-rethink-answer". ViTAR treats medical images as
interactive objects, enabling models to engage multi-step visual reasoning. To
support this approach, we curate a high-quality instruction dataset comprising
1K interactive examples that encode expert-like diagnostic behaviors. In
addition, a 16K visual question answering training data has been curated
towards fine-grained visual diagnosis. We introduce a two-stage training
strategy that begins with supervised fine-tuning to guide cognitive
trajectories, followed by the reinforcement learning to optimize
decision-making. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ViTAR outperforms
strong state-of-the-art models. Visual attention analysis reveals that from the
"think" to "rethink" rounds, ViTAR increasingly anchors visual grounding to
clinically critical regions and maintains high attention allocation to visual
tokens during reasoning, providing mechanistic insight into its improved
performance. These findings demonstrate that embedding expert-style iterative
thinking chains into VLMs enhances both performance and trustworthiness of
medical AI.

Abstract: Deep learning based face-swap videos, widely known as deepfakes, have drawn
wide attention due to their threat to information credibility. Recent works
mainly focus on the problem of deepfake detection that aims to reliably tell
deepfakes apart from real ones, in an objective way. On the other hand, the
subjective perception of deepfakes, especially its computational modeling and
imitation, is also a significant problem but lacks adequate study. In this
paper, we focus on the visual realism assessment of deepfakes, which is defined
as the automatic assessment of deepfake visual realism that approximates human
perception of deepfakes. It is important for evaluating the quality and
deceptiveness of deepfakes which can be used for predicting the influence of
deepfakes on Internet, and it also has potentials in improving the deepfake
generation process by serving as a critic. This paper prompts this new
direction by presenting a comprehensive benchmark called DREAM, which stands
for Deepfake REalism AssessMent. It is comprised of a deepfake video dataset of
diverse quality, a large scale annotation that includes 140,000 realism scores
and textual descriptions obtained from 3,500 human annotators, and a
comprehensive evaluation and analysis of 16 representative realism assessment
methods, including recent large vision language model based methods and a newly
proposed description-aligned CLIP method. The benchmark and insights included
in this study can lay the foundation for future research in this direction and
other related areas.

missing label recovery. In this paper, we propose a novel Collaborative
Learning of Semantic-aware feature learning and Label recovery (CLSL) method
for multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels, which unifies the two
aforementioned challenges into a unified learning framework. More specifically,
we design a semantic-related feature learning module to learn robust
semantic-related features by discovering semantic information and label
correlations. Then, a semantic-guided feature enhancement module is proposed to
generate high-quality discriminative semantic-aware features by effectively
aligning visual and semantic feature spaces. Finally, we introduce a
collaborative learning framework that integrates semantic-aware feature
learning and label recovery, which can not only dynamically enhance the
discriminability of semantic-aware features but also adaptively infer and
recover missing labels, forming a mutually reinforced loop between the two
processes. Extensive experiments on three widely used public datasets (MS-COCO,
VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE) demonstrate that CLSL outperforms the state-of-the-art
multi-label image recognition methods with incomplete labels.

*Pîrvu Mihai-Cristian,Leordeanu Marius*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PHG-MAE模型，将神经图理论与掩码自编码器结合，通过随机掩码整个模态来采样超边分布，统一了预训练和微调过程，并支持推理时集成和知识蒸馏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自监督预训练方法在计算机视觉多模态任务中的应用，特别是针对无人机场景中的多世界解释和多模态数据，避免手动标注数据的需求。

Method: 结合神经图和掩码自编码器，随机掩码整个模态而非仅图像块，在单次训练循环中同时进行预训练和微调，支持推理时集成和知识蒸馏。

Result: 开发了数据流水线软件，创建并发布了Dronescapes数据集的自动化扩展，所有技术细节、代码和复现步骤均已公开。

Conclusion: PHG-MAE模型为多模态多任务学习提供了有效框架，特别适用于无人机场景，并可推广到自动驾驶和室内机器人等其他领域。

Abstract: The computer vision domain has greatly benefited from an abundance of data
across many modalities to improve on various visual tasks. Recently, there has
been a lot of focus on self-supervised pre-training methods through Masked
Autoencoders (MAE) \cite{he2022masked,bachmann2022multimae}, usually used as a
first step before optimizing for a downstream task, such as classification or
regression. This is very useful as it doesn't require any manually labeled
data. In this work, we introduce Probabilistic Hyper-Graphs using Masked
Autoencoders (PHG-MAE): a novel model that unifies the classical work on neural
graphs \cite{leordeanu2021semi} with the modern approach of masked autoencoders
under a common theoretical framework. Through random masking of entire
modalities, not just patches, the model samples from the distribution of
hyper-edges on each forward pass. Additionally, the model adapts the standard
MAE algorithm by combining pre-training and fine-tuning into a single training
loop. Moreover, our approach enables the creation of inference-time ensembles
which, through aggregation, boost the final prediction performance and
consistency. Lastly, we show that we can apply knowledge distillation on top of
the ensembles with little loss in performance, even with models that have fewer
than 1M parameters. While our work mostly focuses on outdoor UAV scenes that
contain multiple world interpretations and modalities, the same steps can be
followed in other similar domains, such as autonomous driving or indoor
robotics. In order to streamline the process of integrating external
pre-trained experts for computer vision multi-modal multi-task learning (MTL)
scenarios, we developed a data-pipeline software. Using this tool, we have
created and released a fully-automated extension of the Dronescapes dataset.
All the technical details, code and reproduction steps are publicly released.

*Meijun Zhou,Gang Mei,Zhengjing Ma,Nengxiong Xu,Jianbing Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉基础模型的通用框架，用于追踪大型滑坡疤痕的时空演化，通过将离散光学遥感图像重构为连续视频序列，实现滑坡演化的连续监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注单阶段或前后双阶段滑坡识别，难以追踪滑坡疤痕的时空演化过程，而这对理解演化机制和失效前兆至关重要。

Method: 将离散遥感图像重构为连续视频序列，利用为视频分割开发的视觉基础模型，在知识引导、自动传播和交互优化范式下进行滑坡疤痕的连续识别。

Result: 在巴格滑坡和色拉滑坡两个案例中验证了框架有效性，能够连续追踪滑坡疤痕，捕捉早期预警所需的失效前兆和评估次生灾害所需的灾后演化。

Conclusion: 该框架为大型滑坡疤痕的时空演化追踪提供了有效解决方案，对早期预警和长期稳定性评估具有重要意义。

Abstract: Tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars is
critical for understanding the evolution mechanisms and failure precursors,
enabling effective early-warning. However, most existing studies have focused
on single-phase or pre- and post-failure dual-phase landslide identification.
Although these approaches delineate post-failure landslide boundaries, it is
challenging to track the spatiotemporal evolution of landslide scars. To
address this problem, this study proposes a novel and universal framework for
tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars using a
vision foundation model. The key idea behind the proposed framework is to
reconstruct discrete optical remote sensing images into a continuous video
sequence. This transformation enables a vision foundation model, which is
developed for video segmentation, to be used for tracking the evolution of
landslide scars. The proposed framework operates within a knowledge-guided,
auto-propagation, and interactive refinement paradigm to ensure the continuous
and accurate identification of landslide scars. The proposed framework was
validated through application to two representative cases: the post-failure
Baige landslide and the active Sela landslide (2017-2025). Results indicate
that the proposed framework enables continuous tracking of landslide scars,
capturing both failure precursors critical for early warning and post-failure
evolution essential for assessing secondary hazards and long-term stability.

*Jiahui Lu,Haihong Xiao,Xueyan Zhao,Wenxiong Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gesplat是一个基于3D高斯泼溅的框架，能够在无姿态稀疏图像下实现鲁棒的新视角合成和几何一致重建，通过VGGT基础模型获取初始姿态和密集点云，结合混合高斯表示、图引导属性优化和流式深度正则化等创新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF和3DGS严重依赖准确的相机姿态和密集视角覆盖，这限制了它们在稀疏视角设置中的应用，因为姿态估计变得不可靠且监督不足。

Method: 1) 使用VGGT基础模型获取可靠的初始姿态和密集点云；2) 混合高斯表示，通过双位置-形状优化和视角间匹配一致性增强；3) 图引导属性优化模块增强场景细节；4) 基于流的深度正则化提高深度估计精度。

Result: 在正向视角和大规模复杂数据集上的综合定量和定性实验表明，该方法相比其他无姿态方法实现了更鲁棒的性能。

Conclusion: Gesplat框架能够有效解决稀疏视角下的3D重建和新视角合成问题，为无姿态稀疏图像场景提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have advanced
3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, but remain heavily dependent on
accurate camera poses and dense viewpoint coverage. These requirements limit
their applicability in sparse-view settings, where pose estimation becomes
unreliable and supervision is insufficient. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce Gesplat, a 3DGS-based framework that enables robust novel view
synthesis and geometrically consistent reconstruction from unposed sparse
images. Unlike prior works that rely on COLMAP for sparse point cloud
initialization, we leverage the VGGT foundation model to obtain more reliable
initial poses and dense point clouds. Our approach integrates several key
innovations: 1) a hybrid Gaussian representation with dual position-shape
optimization enhanced by inter-view matching consistency; 2) a graph-guided
attribute refinement module to enhance scene details; and 3) flow-based depth
regularization that improves depth estimation accuracy for more effective
supervision. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves more robust performance on both forward-facing and
large-scale complex datasets compared to other pose-free methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 首次将无监督联邦学习扩展到分类问题，提出FedCoPL方法，利用CLIP模型通过伪标签分布估计和调整来解决类别不平衡问题，并采用部分提示聚合协议实现有效协作和个性化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督联邦学习主要关注表示学习和聚类任务，而视觉语言模型（如CLIP）的强大零样本预测能力为UFL范式下的分类问题提供了新的机会，但目前尚未被充分探索。

Method: 提出FedCoPL方法：客户端估计并上传伪标签分布，服务器调整并重新分发以避免全局类别不平衡；引入部分提示聚合协议，服务器聚合包含通用图像特征的视觉提示，客户端保留编码个性化知识的文本提示。

Result: 大量实验表明FedCoPL相比基线方法具有优越性能。

Conclusion: 成功将无监督联邦学习扩展到分类问题，FedCoPL方法通过伪标签分布调整和部分提示聚合有效解决了类别不平衡问题，实现了良好的协作和个性化效果。

Abstract: Unsupervised Federated Learning (UFL) aims to collaboratively train a global
model across distributed clients without sharing data or accessing label
information. Previous UFL works have predominantly focused on representation
learning and clustering tasks. Recently, vision language models (e.g., CLIP)
have gained significant attention for their powerful zero-shot prediction
capabilities. Leveraging this advancement, classification problems that were
previously infeasible under the UFL paradigm now present promising new
opportunities, yet remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we extend UFL to
the classification problem with CLIP for the first time and propose a novel
method, \underline{\textbf{Fed}}erated \underline{\textbf{Co}}operative
\underline{\textbf{P}}seudo \underline{\textbf{L}}abeling (\textbf{FedCoPL}).
Specifically, clients estimate and upload their pseudo label distribution, and
the server adjusts and redistributes them to avoid global imbalance among
classes. Moreover, we introduce a partial prompt aggregation protocol for
effective collaboration and personalization. In particular, visual prompts
containing general image features are aggregated at the server, while text
prompts encoding personalized knowledge are retained locally. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FedCoPL compared to
baseline methods. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ACRE方法，通过一致性检查增强强化学习，解决多模态LLM中推理链与最终答案不一致的问题，在视频推理和数学推理任务上分别提升2.2%和1.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RLVR方法虽然能提高答案准确性，但会导致推理过程与最终答案不一致的问题。实验显示GRPO方法在MMVU上只有79.7%的一致性，表明推理步骤与答案选择经常不匹配。

Method: 提出ACRE方法，修改GRPO算法加入辅助一致性检查：模型生成推理链和初始答案后，打乱选项顺序，用相同推理链预测第二个答案，设计一致性验证奖励机制。

Result: 在视频推理和多模态数学推理基准测试中，ACRE相比GRPO基线分别平均提升2.2%和1.5%。

Conclusion: ACRE通过一致性检查有效解决了推理-答案不一致问题，减少了模型对虚假模式（如选项顺序偏差）的依赖，提高了多模态LLM的推理可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can significantly enhance
reasoning abilities by directly optimizing correctness, rather than relying
solely on supervised imitation. This paradigm has been extended to multimodal
LLMs for complex video and image understanding tasks. However, while
outcome-driven RL improves answer accuracy, it can inadvertently decouple the
reasoning chain from the final answer, leading to situations where models
produce inconsistency between the reasoning trace and final answer. In our
experiments on multiple-choice visual question-answering tasks, the standard
GRPO method yields only 79.7\% consistency on MMVU between the reasoning steps
and the chosen answers, indicating frequent mismatches between answers and
reasoning. To this end, we propose Answer-Consistent Reinforcement Learning
(ACRE) that modifies the GRPO algorithm with an auxiliary consistency check.
After the model generates a chain of thought and an initial answer for a given
question, we shuffle the answer options and prompt the model again with the
same reasoning trace to predict a second answer. We design a
consistency-verification reward that grants a high reward only if both the
original and the post-shuffle answers agree and are correct; otherwise, a lower
reward is assigned accordingly. This mechanism penalizes reasoning-answer
misalignment and discourages the model from relying on spurious patterns, such
as option ordering biases. We evaluate ACRE on challenging Video Reasoning
benchmarks and multimodal math reasoning benchmarks, achieving an average 2.2\%
and 1.5\% improvement for Video Reasoning and Math Reasoning tasks over the
GRPO baseline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种不确定性感知的后检测框架，通过统计不确定性和领域相关视觉线索重新调整检测置信度，提升紧凑型深度学习模型在火灾烟雾检测中的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉的火灾烟雾检测方法在效率和可靠性之间难以平衡，紧凑型深度学习模型（如YOLOv5n/YOLOv8n）由于容量减少导致误报和漏检，传统后处理方法仅依赖空间重叠可能抑制真阳性或保留误报。

Method: 提出轻量级置信度精炼网络，集成不确定性估计与颜色、边缘、纹理特征来调整检测分数，无需修改基础模型。

Result: 在D-Fire数据集上的实验显示，相比现有基线方法，精度、召回率和平均精度均有提升，仅带来适度的计算开销。

Conclusion: 后检测重新评分能有效增强紧凑型深度学习模型在真实世界火灾烟雾检测中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate fire and smoke detection is critical for safety and disaster
response, yet existing vision-based methods face challenges in balancing
efficiency and reliability. Compact deep learning models such as YOLOv5n and
YOLOv8n are widely adopted for deployment on UAVs, CCTV systems, and IoT
devices, but their reduced capacity often results in false positives and missed
detections. Conventional post-detection methods such as Non-Maximum Suppression
and Soft-NMS rely only on spatial overlap, which can suppress true positives or
retain false alarms in cluttered or ambiguous fire scenes. To address these
limitations, we propose an uncertainty aware post-detection framework that
rescales detection confidences using both statistical uncertainty and domain
relevant visual cues. A lightweight Confidence Refinement Network integrates
uncertainty estimates with color, edge, and texture features to adjust
detection scores without modifying the base model. Experiments on the D-Fire
dataset demonstrate improved precision, recall, and mean average precision
compared to existing baselines, with only modest computational overhead. These
results highlight the effectiveness of post-detection rescoring in enhancing
the robustness of compact deep learning models for real-world fire and smoke
detection.

Motivation: 图像篡改技术发展带来安全威胁，需要有效的图像篡改定位方法。现有监督方法依赖昂贵的像素级标注，而弱监督或无训练方法性能不足且缺乏可解释性。

Method: ICFC框架结合目标化规则构建和自适应过滤构建可靠知识库，采用多步渐进推理流程，从粗粒度建议到细粒度取证结果，系统利用MLLM进行图像级分类、像素级定位和文本级可解释性分析。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，ICFC不仅超越了最先进的无训练方法，而且与弱监督和全监督方法相比取得了竞争性或更优的性能。

Conclusion: ICFC框架通过利用MLLM的推理能力，实现了无需训练的高性能图像篡改定位，同时提供良好的可解释性，为图像取证领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Advances in image tampering pose serious security threats, underscoring the
need for effective image manipulation localization (IML). While supervised IML
achieves strong performance, it depends on costly pixel-level annotations.
Existing weakly supervised or training-free alternatives often underperform and
lack interpretability. We propose the In-Context Forensic Chain (ICFC), a
training-free framework that leverages multi-modal large language models
(MLLMs) for interpretable IML tasks. ICFC integrates an objectified rule
construction with adaptive filtering to build a reliable knowledge base and a
multi-step progressive reasoning pipeline that mirrors expert forensic
workflows from coarse proposals to fine-grained forensics results. This design
enables systematic exploitation of MLLM reasoning for image-level
classification, pixel-level localization, and text-level interpretability.
Across multiple benchmarks, ICFC not only surpasses state-of-the-art
training-free methods but also achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to weakly and fully supervised approaches.

Motivation: 在增强现实和虚拟现实等沉浸式应用中，传统的轴心虹膜识别系统无法有效处理离轴采集带来的视角失真、质量下降和类内变化等挑战，且缺乏相关数据集。

Method: 通过VR头显收集大规模离轴虹膜数据集ImmerIris，构建评估协议，并提出无需归一化的识别范式，直接从眼部图像学习。

Result: 当前专为经典轴心图像设计的方法在沉浸式设置下表现不佳，而提出的无需归一化方法始终优于基于归一化的对应方法。

Conclusion: 无需归一化的方法为鲁棒的沉浸式虹膜识别提供了有前景的方向，ImmerIris数据集填补了该领域的数据空白。

Abstract: In egocentric applications such as augmented and virtual reality, immersive
iris recognition is emerging as an accurate and seamless way to identify
persons. While classic systems acquire iris images on-axis, i.e., via dedicated
frontal sensors in controlled settings, the immersive setup primarily captures
off-axis irises through tilt-placed headset cameras, with only mild control in
open scenes. This yields unique challenges, including perspective distortion,
intensified quality degradations, and intra-class variations in iris texture.
Datasets capturing these challenges remain scarce. To fill this gap, this paper
introduces ImmerIris, a large-scale dataset collected via VR headsets,
containing 499,791 ocular images from 564 subjects. It is, to the best of
current knowledge, the largest public dataset and among the first dedicated to
off-axis acquisition. Based on ImmerIris, evaluation protocols are constructed
to benchmark recognition methods under different challenging factors. Current
methods, primarily designed for classic on-axis imagery, perform
unsatisfactorily on the immersive setup, mainly due to reliance on fallible
normalization. To this end, this paper further proposes a normalization-free
paradigm that directly learns from ocular images with minimal adjustment.
Despite its simplicity, this approach consistently outperforms
normalization-based counterparts, pointing to a promising direction for robust
immersive recognition.

Motivation: 现有基于手势的帕金森病识别系统性能不理想，需要开发更准确的帕金森病严重程度评估工具来支持临床管理和干预发展。

Method: 收集手指敲击视频，提取时域、频域和幅度特征，构建混合深度学习框架：CNN提取空间特征，BiLSTM建模时序动态，注意力机制聚焦关键特征，最后通过全连接层和softmax分类器进行五级严重程度分类。

Result: 模型在区分五个严重程度类别方面表现出色，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 结合时空表征和注意力机制可以改进帕金森病严重程度的自动检测，为临床医生提供有前景的非侵入性监测工具。

Abstract: Effective clinical management and intervention development depend on accurate
evaluation of Parkinsons disease (PD) severity. Many researchers have worked on
developing gesture-based PD recognition systems; however, their performance
accuracy is not satisfactory. In this study, we propose a multi-class Parkinson
Disease detection system based on finger tapping using an attention-enhanced
CNN BiLSTM. We collected finger tapping videos and derived temporal, frequency,
and amplitude based features from wrist and hand movements. Then, we proposed a
hybrid deep learning framework integrating CNN, BiLSTM, and attention
mechanisms for multi-class PD severity classification from video-derived motion
features. First, the input sequence is reshaped and passed through a Conv1D
MaxPooling block to capture local spatial dependencies. The resulting feature
maps are fed into a BiLSTM layer to model temporal dynamics. An attention
mechanism focuses on the most informative temporal features, producing a
context vector that is further processed by a second BiLSTM layer. CNN-derived
features and attention-enhanced BiLSTM outputs are concatenated, followed by
dense and dropout layers, before the final softmax classifier outputs the
predicted PD severity level. The model demonstrated strong performance in
distinguishing between the five severity classes, suggesting that integrating
spatial temporal representations with attention mechanisms can improve
automated PD severity detection, making it a promising non-invasive tool to
support clinicians in PD monitoring and progression tracking.

Motivation: 现有方法在暗光图像增强和超分辨率任务中参数过多、计算量大，且SSIM和PSNR指标较低，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用DeepFusionNet架构，基于自动编码器而非GAN，参数数量大幅减少（暗光增强约250万参数，超分辨率约10万参数）。

Result: 在LOL-v1数据集上，暗光增强达到SSIM 92.8%、PSNR 26.30；超分辨率达到PSNR 25.30、SSIM 80.7%。

Conclusion: DeepFusionNet在保持高性能的同时显著减少了参数数量，为实时图像处理应用提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Computer vision and image processing applications suffer from dark and
low-light images, particularly during real-time image transmission. Currently,
low light and dark images are converted to bright and colored forms using
autoencoders; however, these methods often achieve low SSIM and PSNR scores and
require high computational power due to their large number of parameters. To
address these challenges, the DeepFusionNet architecture has been developed.
According to the results obtained with the LOL-v1 dataset, DeepFusionNet
achieved an SSIM of 92.8% and a PSNR score of 26.30, while containing only
approximately 2.5 million parameters. On the other hand, conversion of blurry
and low-resolution images into high-resolution and blur-free images has gained
importance in image processing applications. Unlike GAN-based super-resolution
methods, an autoencoder-based super resolution model has been developed that
contains approximately 100 thousand parameters and uses the DeepFusionNet
architecture. According to the results of the tests, the DeepFusionNet based
super-resolution method achieved a PSNR of 25.30 and a SSIM score of 80.7
percent according to the validation set.

Abstract: Litchi is a high-value fruit, yet traditional manual selection methods are
increasingly inadequate for modern production demands. Integrating UAV-based
aerial imagery with deep learning offers a promising solution to enhance
efficiency and reduce costs. This paper introduces YOLOv11-Litchi, a
lightweight and robust detection model specifically designed for UAV-based
litchi detection. Built upon the YOLOv11 framework, the proposed model
addresses key challenges such as small target size, large model parameters
hindering deployment, and frequent target occlusion. To tackle these issues,
three major innovations are incorporated: a multi-scale residual module to
improve contextual feature extraction across scales, a lightweight feature
fusion method to reduce model size and computational costs while maintaining
high accuracy, and a litchi occlusion detection head to mitigate occlusion
effects by emphasizing target regions and suppressing background interference.
Experimental results validate the model's effectiveness. YOLOv11-Litchi
achieves a parameter size of 6.35 MB - 32.5% smaller than the YOLOv11 baseline
- while improving mAP by 2.5% to 90.1% and F1-Score by 1.4% to 85.5%.
Additionally, the model achieves a frame rate of 57.2 FPS, meeting real-time
detection requirements. These findings demonstrate the suitability of
YOLOv11-Litchi for UAV-based litchi detection in complex orchard environments,
showcasing its potential for broader applications in precision agriculture.

TL;DR: Color3D是一个用于从单色输入为静态和动态3D场景着色的灵活框架，通过个性化颜色器实现跨视图和时间的一致性，同时保持颜色多样性和用户控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注静态场景，通过平均颜色变化来强制多视图一致性，但这会牺牲颜色丰富性和可控性。Color3D旨在解决这一问题，在保持一致性的同时保留颜色多样性和可操控性。

Method: 核心方法是仅对一个关键视图着色，然后微调个性化颜色器将颜色传播到新视图和时间步。通过个性化，颜色器学习场景特定的确定性颜色映射，通过其固有归纳偏置将对应颜色一致地投影到新视图和视频帧中。

Result: 在多样静态和动态3D着色基准测试中，该方法能够提供更一致和色彩丰富的渲染效果，并具有精确的用户控制。

Conclusion: Color3D巧妙地将复杂的3D着色问题重新表述为更易处理的单图像范式，允许无缝集成任意图像着色模型，增强了灵活性和可控性。

Abstract: In this work, we present Color3D, a highly adaptable framework for colorizing
both static and dynamic 3D scenes from monochromatic inputs, delivering
visually diverse and chromatically vibrant reconstructions with flexible
user-guided control. In contrast to existing methods that focus solely on
static scenarios and enforce multi-view consistency by averaging color
variations which inevitably sacrifice both chromatic richness and
controllability, our approach is able to preserve color diversity and
steerability while ensuring cross-view and cross-time consistency. In
particular, the core insight of our method is to colorize only a single key
view and then fine-tune a personalized colorizer to propagate its color to
novel views and time steps. Through personalization, the colorizer learns a
scene-specific deterministic color mapping underlying the reference view,
enabling it to consistently project corresponding colors to the content in
novel views and video frames via its inherent inductive bias. Once trained, the
personalized colorizer can be applied to infer consistent chrominance for all
other images, enabling direct reconstruction of colorful 3D scenes with a
dedicated Lab color space Gaussian splatting representation. The proposed
framework ingeniously recasts complicated 3D colorization as a more tractable
single image paradigm, allowing seamless integration of arbitrary image
colorization models with enhanced flexibility and controllability. Extensive
experiments across diverse static and dynamic 3D colorization benchmarks
substantiate that our method can deliver more consistent and chromatically rich
renderings with precise user control. Project Page

Motivation: 缺血性卒中诊断中准确识别闭塞血管位置是一个关键挑战，现有方法主要关注病变分割，血管定位研究有限

Method: 结合nnUNet分割分支进行病变检测，使用动脉图谱进行血管映射和识别，以及使用pGAN从MRI生成MRA图像

Conclusion: 该方法有潜力实现更快、更明智的卒中诊断

Abstract: A key challenge in ischemic stroke diagnosis using medical imaging is the
accurate localization of the occluded vessel. Current machine learning methods
in focus primarily on lesion segmentation, with limited work on vessel
localization. In this study, we introduce Stroke Locus Net, an end-to-end deep
learning pipeline for detection, segmentation, and occluded vessel localization
using only MRI scans. The proposed system combines a segmentation branch using
nnUNet for lesion detection with an arterial atlas for vessel mapping and
identification, and a generation branch using pGAN to synthesize MRA images
from MRI. Our implementation demonstrates promising results in localizing
occluded vessels on stroke-affected T1 MRI scans, with potential for faster and
more informed stroke diagnosis.

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., FLUX.1)
have greatly improved visual fidelity in consistent character generation and
editing. However, existing methods rarely unify these tasks within a single
framework. Generation-based approaches struggle with fine-grained identity
consistency across instances, while editing-based methods often lose spatial
controllability and instruction alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose
ReMix, a unified framework for character-consistent generation and editing. It
constitutes two core components: the ReMix Module and IP-ControlNet. The ReMix
Module leverages the multimodal reasoning ability of MLLMs to edit semantic
features of input images and adapt instruction embeddings to the native DiT
backbone without fine-tuning. While this ensures coherent semantic layouts,
pixel-level consistency and pose controllability remain challenging. To address
this, IP-ControlNet extends ControlNet to decouple semantic and layout cues
from reference images and introduces an {\epsilon}-equivariant latent space
that jointly denoises the reference and target images within a shared noise
space. Inspired by convergent evolution and quantum decoherence,i.e., where
environmental noise drives state convergence, this design promotes feature
alignment in the hidden space, enabling consistent object generation while
preserving identity. ReMix supports a wide range of tasks, including
personalized generation, image editing, style transfer, and multi-condition
synthesis. Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness and efficiency as a
unified framework for character-consistent image generation and editing.

TL;DR: 提出SaFiRe框架，通过模拟人类两阶段认知过程来解决复杂指称图像分割问题，特别针对对象干扰和类别隐式表达等挑战性场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指称图像分割方法主要处理简单表达式，将其简化为关键词匹配问题，难以处理真实世界中存在指称歧义的复杂表达。

Method: 提出SaFiRe框架，采用两阶段认知过程：先形成全局理解，再通过细节导向的检查进行细化。利用Mamba的扫描-更新特性实现高效多轮细化。

Result: 在标准和提出的aRefCOCO基准测试上，SaFiRe均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SaFiRe通过模拟人类认知过程有效处理复杂指称表达，为指称图像分割提供了新思路。

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) aims to segment the target object in an
image given a natural language expression. While recent methods leverage
pre-trained vision backbones and more training corpus to achieve impressive
results, they predominantly focus on simple expressions--short, clear noun
phrases like "red car" or "left girl". This simplification often reduces RIS to
a key word/concept matching problem, limiting the model's ability to handle
referential ambiguity in expressions. In this work, we identify two challenging
real-world scenarios: object-distracting expressions, which involve multiple
entities with contextual cues, and category-implicit expressions, where the
object class is not explicitly stated. To address the challenges, we propose a
novel framework, SaFiRe, which mimics the human two-phase cognitive
process--first forming a global understanding, then refining it through
detail-oriented inspection. This is naturally supported by Mamba's
scan-then-update property, which aligns with our phased design and enables
efficient multi-cycle refinement with linear complexity. We further introduce
aRefCOCO, a new benchmark designed to evaluate RIS models under ambiguous
referring expressions. Extensive experiments on both standard and proposed
datasets demonstrate the superiority of SaFiRe over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: 开发并发布了简单有效的交互式标注工具，整合了算法，使生态学研究者能够利用基础模型和计算机视觉高效生成高质量分割掩码。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is essential to automate underwater imagery analysis
with ecology monitoring purposes. Unfortunately, fine grained underwater scene
analysis is still an open problem even for top performing segmentation models.
The high cost of obtaining dense, expert-annotated, segmentation labels hinders
the supervision of models in this domain. While sparse point-labels are easier
to obtain, they introduce challenges regarding which points to annotate and how
to propagate the sparse information. We present SparseUWSeg, a novel framework
that addresses both issues. SparseUWSeg employs an active sampling strategy to
guide annotators, maximizing the value of their point labels. Then, it
propagates these sparse labels with a hybrid approach leverages both the best
of SAM2 and superpixel-based methods. Experiments on two diverse underwater
datasets demonstrate the benefits of SparseUWSeg over state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving up to +5\% mIoU over D+NN. Our main contribution is the
design and release of a simple but effective interactive annotation tool,
integrating our algorithms. It enables ecology researchers to leverage
foundation models and computer vision to efficiently generate high-quality
segmentation masks to process their data.

Motivation: 现有概念模型将概念视为数值属性，缺乏视觉定位能力，限制了在高风险场景（如医疗应用）中的实用性。

Method: 提出基于transformer的框架，使用多概念可学习token，通过专门的注意力层处理视觉和文本概念token，联合预测和定位视觉概念。

Result: 在合成和真实医学数据集上的实验表明，ViConEx-Med在概念检测和定位精度方面优于现有概念模型，与黑盒模型性能相当。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建基于视觉概念的内在可解释模型提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Concept-based models aim to explain model decisions with human-understandable
concepts. However, most existing approaches treat concepts as numerical
attributes, without providing complementary visual explanations that could
localize the predicted concepts. This limits their utility in real-world
applications and particularly in high-stakes scenarios, such as medical
use-cases. This paper proposes ViConEx-Med, a novel transformer-based framework
for visual concept explainability, which introduces multi-concept learnable
tokens to jointly predict and localize visual concepts. By leveraging
specialized attention layers for processing visual and text-based concept
tokens, our method produces concept-level localization maps while maintaining
high predictive accuracy. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world medical
datasets demonstrate that ViConEx-Med outperforms prior concept-based models
and achieves competitive performance with black-box models in terms of both
concept detection and localization precision. Our results suggest a promising
direction for building inherently interpretable models grounded in visual
concepts. Code is publicly available at

Method: 预测物体前后表面的3D坐标，并在两者之间密集采样3D坐标，创建超密集的2D-3D对应关系。提出分层连续坐标编码(HCCE)来更准确高效地表示前后表面坐标。

Conclusion: 通过利用物体的完整表面和内部信息，结合HCCE编码技术，可以显著提高姿态估计的准确性，为物体姿态估计提供了新的思路。

Abstract: In pose estimation for seen objects, a prevalent pipeline involves using
neural networks to predict dense 3D coordinates of the object surface on 2D
images, which are then used to establish dense 2D-3D correspondences. However,
current methods primarily focus on more efficient encoding techniques to
improve the precision of predicted 3D coordinates on the object's front
surface, overlooking the potential benefits of incorporating the back surface
and interior of the object. To better utilize the full surface and interior of
the object, this study predicts 3D coordinates of both the object's front and
back surfaces and densely samples 3D coordinates between them. This process
creates ultra-dense 2D-3D correspondences, effectively enhancing pose
estimation accuracy based on the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm.
Additionally, we propose Hierarchical Continuous Coordinate Encoding (HCCE) to
provide a more accurate and efficient representation of front and back surface
coordinates. Experimental results show that, compared to existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the BOP website, the proposed approach
outperforms across seven classic BOP core datasets. Code is available at

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become powerful platforms for real-time,
high-resolution data collection, producing massive volumes of aerial videos.
Efficient retrieval of relevant content from these videos is crucial for
applications in urban management, emergency response, security, and disaster
relief. While text-video retrieval has advanced in natural video domains, the
UAV domain remains underexplored due to limitations in existing datasets, such
as coarse and redundant captions. Thus, in this work, we construct the Drone
Video-Text Match Dataset (DVTMD), which contains 2,864 videos and 14,320
fine-grained, semantically diverse captions. The annotations capture multiple
complementary aspects, including human actions, objects, background settings,
environmental conditions, and visual style, thereby enhancing text-video
correspondence and reducing redundancy. Building on this dataset, we propose
the Text-Conditioned Multi-granularity Alignment (TCMA) framework, which
integrates global video-sentence alignment, sentence-guided frame aggregation,
and word-guided patch alignment. To further refine local alignment, we design a
Word and Patch Selection module that filters irrelevant content, as well as a
Text-Adaptive Dynamic Temperature Mechanism that adapts attention sharpness to
text type. Extensive experiments on DVTMD and CapERA establish the first
complete benchmark for drone text-video retrieval. Our TCMA achieves
state-of-the-art performance, including 45.5% R@1 in text-to-video and 42.8%
R@1 in video-to-text retrieval, demonstrating the effectiveness of our dataset
and method. The code and dataset will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为伪平衡的方法，用于在半监督学习中缓解人脸性别分类模型中的种族和性别偏见。该方法通过在伪标签选择过程中强制实现人口统计平衡，仅使用未标记图像而不需要真实标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸性别分类模型经常反映并放大训练数据中的人口统计偏见，导致在不同性别和种族子组中表现不均。需要一种简单有效的方法来缓解这种偏见，特别是在半监督学习场景下。

Method: 伪平衡方法：在伪标签选择过程中强制实现人口统计平衡，仅使用来自种族平衡数据集的未标记图像，无需访问真实标注。在两种条件下评估：(1)使用FairFace数据集的未标记图像微调有偏见的性别分类器；(2)使用故意不平衡的训练数据进行压力测试。

Result: 伪平衡方法在保持或提高准确性的同时持续改善公平性。总体准确率达到79.81%，比基线提高6.53%；性别准确率差距减少44.17%。在东亚子组中，基线差异超过49%，差距缩小至仅5.01%。

Conclusion: 即使在没有标签监督的情况下，访问人口统计平衡或适度偏斜的未标记数据集可以作为消除现有计算机视觉模型偏见的有力资源。

Abstract: Face gender classification models often reflect and amplify demographic
biases present in their training data, leading to uneven performance across
gender and racial subgroups. We introduce pseudo-balancing, a simple and
effective strategy for mitigating such biases in semi-supervised learning. Our
method enforces demographic balance during pseudo-label selection, using only
unlabeled images from a race-balanced dataset without requiring access to
ground-truth annotations.
  We evaluate pseudo-balancing under two conditions: (1) fine-tuning a biased
gender classifier using unlabeled images from the FairFace dataset, and (2)
stress-testing the method with intentionally imbalanced training data to
simulate controlled bias scenarios. In both cases, models are evaluated on the
All-Age-Faces (AAF) benchmark, which contains a predominantly East Asian
population. Our results show that pseudo-balancing consistently improves
fairness while preserving or enhancing accuracy. The method achieves 79.81%
overall accuracy - a 6.53% improvement over the baseline - and reduces the
gender accuracy gap by 44.17%. In the East Asian subgroup, where baseline
disparities exceeded 49%, the gap is narrowed to just 5.01%. These findings
suggest that even in the absence of label supervision, access to a
demographically balanced or moderately skewed unlabeled dataset can serve as a
powerful resource for debiasing existing computer vision models.

Motivation: 当前方法仅建模成对物体关系，忽略了n元组合在多模态关系理解中的全局感知重要性，导致3D-语言对齐困难。

Method: 扩展关系学习到n元关系，设计分组监督损失促进n元关系学习，在n元关系场景图中使用混合注意力机制的多模态网络进行目标定位。

Result: 在ReferIt3D和ScanRefer基准测试中优于现有最先进方法，证明了n元关系感知在3D定位中的优势。

Conclusion: n元关系学习框架有效提升了3D物体定位性能，验证了全局关系感知的重要性。

Abstract: Localizing 3D objects using natural language is essential for robotic scene
understanding. The descriptions often involve multiple spatial relationships to
distinguish similar objects, making 3D-language alignment difficult. Current
methods only model relationships for pairwise objects, ignoring the global
perceptual significance of n-ary combinations in multi-modal relational
understanding. To address this, we propose a novel progressive relational
learning framework for 3D object grounding. We extend relational learning from
binary to n-ary to identify visual relations that match the referential
description globally. Given the absence of specific annotations for referred
objects in the training data, we design a grouped supervision loss to
facilitate n-ary relational learning. In the scene graph created with n-ary
relationships, we use a multi-modal network with hybrid attention mechanisms to
further localize the target within the n-ary combinations. Experiments and
ablation studies on the ReferIt3D and ScanRefer benchmarks demonstrate that our
method outperforms the state-of-the-art, and proves the advantages of the n-ary
relational perception in 3D localization.

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a major malignancy, necessitating extensive and
complex histopathological assessments and comprehensive support tools. Although
deep learning shows promise, these models still lack accuracy and
generalizability. General foundation models offer a broader reach but remain
limited in capturing subspecialty-specific features and task adaptability. We
introduce the Cervical Subspecialty Pathology (CerS-Path) diagnostic system,
developed through two synergistic pretraining stages: self-supervised learning
on approximately 190 million tissue patches from 140,000 slides to build a
cervical-specific feature extractor, and multimodal enhancement with 2.5
million image-text pairs, followed by integration with multiple downstream
diagnostic functions. Supporting eight diagnostic functions, including rare
cancer classification and multimodal Q&A, CerS-Path surpasses prior foundation
models in scope and clinical applicability. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate a significant advance in cervical pathology, with prospective
testing on 3,173 cases across five centers maintaining 99.38% screening
sensitivity and excellent generalizability, highlighting its potential for
subspecialty diagnostic translation and cervical cancer screening.

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of autonomous driving perception systems requires
extensive environment-based testing, yet real-world execution is often
impractical. Synthetic datasets have therefore emerged as a promising
alternative, offering advantages such as cost-effectiveness, bias free
labeling, and controllable scenarios. However, the domain gap between synthetic
and real-world datasets remains a critical bottleneck for the generalization of
AI-based autonomous driving models. Quantifying this synthetic-to-real gap is
thus essential for evaluating dataset utility and guiding the design of more
effective training pipelines. In this paper, we establish a systematic
framework for quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap in autonomous driving
systems, and propose Style Embedding Distribution Discrepancy (SEDD) as a novel
evaluation metric. Our framework combines Gram matrix-based style extraction
with metric learning optimized for intra-class compactness and inter-class
separation to extract style embeddings. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark
using publicly available datasets. Experiments are conducted on a variety of
datasets and sim-to-real methods, and the results show that our method is
capable of quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap. This work provides a
standardized quality control tool that enables systematic diagnosis and
targeted enhancement of synthetic datasets, advancing future development of
data-driven autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of
  AI-generated content (AIGC) has enabled the synthesis of visually convincing
images; however, many such outputs exhibit subtle \textbf{semantic anomalies},
including unrealistic object configurations, violations of physical laws, or
commonsense inconsistencies, which compromise the overall plausibility of the
generated scenes. Detecting these semantic-level anomalies
  is essential for assessing the trustworthiness of AIGC media, especially in
AIGC image analysis, explainable deepfake detection and semantic authenticity
assessment. In this paper,
  we formalize \textbf{semantic anomaly detection and reasoning} for AIGC
images and
  introduce \textbf{AnomReason}, a large-scale benchmark with structured
annotations as quadruples \emph{(Name, Phenomenon, Reasoning, Severity)}.
Annotations are produced by
  a modular multi-agent pipeline (\textbf{AnomAgent}) with lightweight
human-in-the-loop verification, enabling scale while preserving quality.
  At construction time, AnomAgent processed approximately 4.17\,B GPT-4o
tokens, providing scale evidence for the resulting structured annotations. We
further
  show that models fine-tuned on AnomReason achieve consistent gains over
strong vision-language baselines under our proposed semantic matching metric
(\textit{SemAP} and \textit{SemF1}).
  Applications to {explainable deepfake detection} and {semantic reasonableness
assessment of image generators} demonstrate practical utility. In summary,
AnomReason and AnomAgent
  serve as a foundation for measuring and improving the semantic plausibility
of AI-generated images. We will release code, metrics, data, and task-aligned
models to support reproducible research on semantic authenticity and
interpretable AIGC forensics.

Abstract: Recent advances in large generative models have shown that simple
autoregressive formulations, when scaled appropriately, can exhibit strong
zero-shot generalization across domains. Motivated by this trend, we
investigate whether autoregressive video modeling principles can be directly
applied to medical imaging tasks, despite the model never being trained on
medical data. Specifically, we evaluate a large vision model (LVM) in a
zero-shot setting across four representative tasks: organ segmentation,
denoising, super-resolution, and motion prediction. Remarkably, even without
domain-specific fine-tuning, the LVM can delineate anatomical structures in CT
scans and achieve competitive performance on segmentation, denoising, and
super-resolution. Most notably, in radiotherapy motion prediction, the model
forecasts future 3D CT phases directly from prior phases of a 4D CT scan,
producing anatomically consistent predictions that capture patient-specific
respiratory dynamics with realistic temporal coherence. We evaluate the LVM on

### [65] [Opacity-Gradient Driven Density Control for Compact and Efficient Few-Shot 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10257)
*Abdelrhman Elrawy,Emad A. Mohammed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个改进3D高斯泼溅在少样本场景下效率的框架，通过使用不透明度梯度作为渲染误差的轻量级代理来触发致密化，结合保守的剪枝策略和深度相关损失，显著减少基元数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在少样本场景中容易过拟合并产生臃肿的重建结果，现有方法虽然提高了质量但显著增加了基元数量，需要更高效的优化方法。

Method: 用不透明度梯度替代标准位置梯度启发式方法作为致密化触发条件，采用更保守的剪枝策略防止破坏性优化循环，结合标准深度相关损失提供几何指导。

Result: 在3-view LLFF数据集上比FSGS紧凑40%以上（32k vs 57k基元），在Mip-NeRF 360数据集上减少约70%基元数量，在重建指标上仅有适度折衷。

Conclusion: 该框架在少样本视图合成的质量-效率帕累托边界上建立了新的最先进水平，实现了基元数量的大幅减少。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles in few-shot scenarios, where its
standard adaptive density control (ADC) can lead to overfitting and bloated
reconstructions. While state-of-the-art methods like FSGS improve quality, they
often do so by significantly increasing the primitive count. This paper
presents a framework that revises the core 3DGS optimization to prioritize
efficiency. We replace the standard positional gradient heuristic with a novel
densification trigger that uses the opacity gradient as a lightweight proxy for
rendering error. We find this aggressive densification is only effective when
paired with a more conservative pruning schedule, which prevents destructive
optimization cycles. Combined with a standard depth-correlation loss for
geometric guidance, our framework demonstrates a fundamental improvement in
efficiency. On the 3-view LLFF dataset, our model is over 40% more compact (32k
vs. 57k primitives) than FSGS, and on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset, it achieves a
reduction of approximately 70%. This dramatic gain in compactness is achieved
with a modest trade-off in reconstruction metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art on the quality-vs-efficiency Pareto frontier for few-shot view
synthesis.

TL;DR: VividAnimator是一个端到端的音频和稀疏手部姿态驱动的人体动画框架，通过预训练手部清晰度码本、双流音频感知模块和姿态校准技巧，解决了现有方法中头部运动僵硬和手部模糊的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频和姿态驱动的人体动画方法存在头部运动僵硬和手部模糊的问题，主要原因是音频与头部运动相关性弱，以及手部结构复杂。

Method: 1. 预训练手部清晰度码本(HCC)编码高保真手部纹理先验；2. 设计双流音频感知模块(DSAA)分别建模唇部同步和自然头部姿态动态；3. 引入姿态校准技巧(PCT)通过放松刚性约束来优化姿态条件。

Result: 大量实验表明VividAnimator达到最先进性能，生成具有优越手部细节、手势真实性和身份一致性的视频，通过定量指标和定性评估验证。

Conclusion: VividAnimator通过创新的手部码本、双流音频处理和姿态校准技术，成功解决了音频姿态驱动动画中的关键问题，实现了高质量的人体动画生成。

Abstract: Existing for audio- and pose-driven human animation methods often struggle
with stiff head movements and blurry hands, primarily due to the weak
correlation between audio and head movements and the structural complexity of
hands. To address these issues, we propose VividAnimator, an end-to-end
framework for generating high-quality, half-body human animations driven by
audio and sparse hand pose conditions. Our framework introduces three key
innovations. First, to overcome the instability and high cost of online
codebook training, we pre-train a Hand Clarity Codebook (HCC) that encodes
rich, high-fidelity hand texture priors, significantly mitigating hand
degradation. Second, we design a Dual-Stream Audio-Aware Module (DSAA) to model
lip synchronization and natural head pose dynamics separately while enabling
interaction. Third, we introduce a Pose Calibration Trick (PCT) that refines
and aligns pose conditions by relaxing rigid constraints, ensuring smooth and
natural gesture transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Vivid
Animator achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing videos with superior
hand detail, gesture realism, and identity consistency, validated by both
quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的方法通常只依赖透视视图或鸟瞰图特征，限制了同时利用细粒度物体细节和空间结构化场景表示的能力。

Method: 提出混合检测跟踪框架，结合PV和BEV相机图像特征，通过基础模型引导的BEV映射，将描述性DINOv2特征蒸馏到BEV表示中，使用可变形聚合增强3D物体检测和跟踪。

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse 2基准测试上的广泛实验表明，DualViewDistill实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 结果展示了基础模型BEV映射在实现更可靠自动驾驶感知方面的潜力。

Abstract: Camera-based 3D object detection and tracking are essential for perception in
autonomous driving. Current state-of-the-art approaches often rely exclusively
on either perspective-view (PV) or bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, limiting
their ability to leverage both fine-grained object details and spatially
structured scene representations. In this work, we propose DualViewDistill, a
hybrid detection and tracking framework that incorporates both PV and BEV
camera image features to leverage their complementary strengths. Our approach
introduces BEV maps guided by foundation models, leveraging descriptive DINOv2
features that are distilled into BEV representations through a novel
distillation process. By integrating PV features with BEV maps enriched with
semantic and geometric features from DINOv2, our model leverages this hybrid
representation via deformable aggregation to enhance 3D object detection and
tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 benchmarks
demonstrate that DualViewDistill achieves state-of-the-art performance. The
results showcase the potential of foundation model BEV maps to enable more
reliable perception for autonomous driving. We make the code and pre-trained
models available at https://dualviewdistill.cs.uni-freiburg.de .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM2LoRA是一种参数高效的微调策略，通过将低秩适配器集成到图像编码器和掩码解码器中，仅需不到5%的可训练参数即可适配Segment Anything Model 2用于眼底图像分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然SAM2在多尺度特征解码方面表现出色，但在眼底图像分割任务中的微调仍然具有挑战性。需要一种参数高效的方法来适应特定领域的分割任务。

Method: 在图像编码器和掩码解码器中集成低秩适配器，使用结合分割BCE、SoftDice和FocalTversky损失的复合损失函数进行网络优化。

Result: 在11个具有挑战性的眼底分割数据集上评估，SAM2LoRA在跨数据集训练条件下，在血管和视盘分割方面均表现出高性能，Dice分数分别达到0.86和0.93，AUC值分别达到0.98和0.99。

Conclusion: SAM2LoRA在显著减少训练开销的同时，实现了最先进的性能，为眼底图像分割提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose SAM2LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that adapts
the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for fundus image segmentation. SAM2 employs
a masked autoencoder-pretrained Hierarchical Vision Transformer for multi-scale
feature decoding, enabling rapid inference in low-resource settings; however,
fine-tuning remains challenging. To address this, SAM2LoRA integrates a
low-rank adapter into both the image encoder and mask decoder, requiring fewer
than 5\% of the original trainable parameters. Our analysis indicates that for
cross-dataset fundus segmentation tasks, a composite loss function combining
segmentationBCE, SoftDice, and FocalTversky losses is essential for optimal
network tuning. Evaluated on 11 challenging fundus segmentation datasets,
SAM2LoRA demonstrates high performance in both blood vessel and optic disc
segmentation under cross-dataset training conditions. It achieves Dice scores
of up to 0.86 and 0.93 for blood vessel and optic disc segmentation,
respectively, and AUC values of up to 0.98 and 0.99, achieving state-of-the-art
performance while substantially reducing training overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界场景（如ScanNet）难以捕捉且数据有限，生成具有多样化物体姿态的真实场景仍然是一个开放且具有挑战性的任务。

Method: 引入分解表示法，将场景分解为层次化组织的房间程序和物体姿态概念。学习可重用布局模式的函数库，使用大语言模型生成高级程序，并学习程序条件模型来分层预测物体姿态。

Result: FactoredScenes生成的逼真真实世界房间难以与真实的ScanNet场景区分开来。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效合成具有真实感的3D场景，解决了现实场景生成中的挑战。

Abstract: Real-world scenes, such as those in ScanNet, are difficult to capture, with
highly limited data available. Generating realistic scenes with varied object
poses remains an open and challenging task. In this work, we propose
FactoredScenes, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D scenes by leveraging
the underlying structure of rooms while learning the variation of object poses
from lived-in scenes. We introduce a factored representation that decomposes
scenes into hierarchically organized concepts of room programs and object
poses. To encode structure, FactoredScenes learns a library of functions
capturing reusable layout patterns from which scenes are drawn, then uses large
language models to generate high-level programs, regularized by the learned
library. To represent scene variations, FactoredScenes learns a
program-conditioned model to hierarchically predict object poses, and retrieves
and places 3D objects in a scene. We show that FactoredScenes generates
realistic, real-world rooms that are difficult to distinguish from real ScanNet
scenes.

Abstract: Accurate traffic congestion classification is essential for intelligent
transportation systems and real-time urban traffic management. This paper
presents a multimodal framework combining open-vocabulary visual-language
reasoning (CLIP), object detection (YOLO-World), and motion analysis via
MOG2-based background subtraction. The system predicts congestion levels on an
ordinal scale from 1 (free flow) to 5 (severe congestion), enabling
semantically aligned and temporally consistent classification. To enhance
interpretability, we incorporate motion-based confidence weighting and generate
annotated visual outputs. Experimental results show the model achieves 76.7

0.684, significantly outperforming unimodal baselines. These results
demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in preserving ordinal structure and
leveraging visual-language and motion modalities. Future enhancements include
incorporating vehicle sizing and refined density metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统摄影测量方法需要70-80%的图像重叠率才能生成准确的正射影像，而资源受限的AI系统难以达到这一要求，导致重建质量下降，限制了农民对自主监测技术的采用。

Method: 提出Ortho-Fuse框架，利用光流估计在连续航拍帧之间合成过渡图像，人为增强特征对应关系，从而改善几何重建质量。

Result: 实验验证表明，该方法可将最小重叠率要求降低20%。

Conclusion: 该研究为AI驱动的作物监测系统在精准农业中的集成提供了技术路径，有助于克服采用障碍。

Abstract: AI-driven crop health mapping systems offer substantial advantages over
conventional monitoring approaches through accelerated data acquisition and
cost reduction. However, widespread farmer adoption remains constrained by
technical limitations in orthomosaic generation from sparse aerial imagery
datasets. Traditional photogrammetric reconstruction requires 70-80\%
inter-image overlap to establish sufficient feature correspondences for
accurate geometric registration. AI-driven systems operating under
resource-constrained conditions cannot consistently achieve these overlap
thresholds, resulting in degraded reconstruction quality that undermines user
confidence in autonomous monitoring technologies. In this paper, we present
Ortho-Fuse, an optical flow-based framework that enables the generation of a
reliable orthomosaic with reduced overlap requirements. Our approach employs
intermediate flow estimation to synthesize transitional imagery between
consecutive aerial frames, artificially augmenting feature correspondences for
improved geometric reconstruction. Experimental validation demonstrates a 20\%
reduction in minimum overlap requirements. We further analyze adoption barriers
in precision agriculture to identify pathways for enhanced integration of
AI-driven monitoring systems.

Motivation: 现有模型依赖训练时学习的归纳偏差，难以适应测试时的新结构模式和传感器引起的失真

Method: 提出基于MAML的元辅助学习策略，通过两个自监督辅助目标优化补全模型，并在推理时动态调整编码器

Result: 在合成、模拟和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，PointMAC实现了最先进的结果

Conclusion: 这是首个将元辅助测试时自适应应用于点云补全的工作，能够为每个样本单独细化生成高质量补全

Abstract: Point cloud completion is essential for robust 3D perception in
safety-critical applications such as robotics and augmented reality. However,
existing models perform static inference and rely heavily on inductive biases
learned during training, limiting their ability to adapt to novel structural
patterns and sensor-induced distortions at test time. To address this
limitation, we propose PointMAC, a meta-learned framework for robust test-time
adaptation in point cloud completion. It enables sample-specific refinement
without requiring additional supervision. Our method optimizes the completion
model under two self-supervised auxiliary objectives that simulate structural
and sensor-level incompleteness. A meta-auxiliary learning strategy based on
Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) ensures that adaptation driven by auxiliary
objectives is consistently aligned with the primary completion task. During
inference, we adapt the shared encoder on-the-fly by optimizing auxiliary
losses, with the decoder kept fixed. To further stabilize adaptation, we
introduce Adaptive $\lambda$-Calibration, a meta-learned mechanism for
balancing gradients between primary and auxiliary objectives. Extensive
experiments on synthetic, simulated, and real-world datasets demonstrate that
PointMAC achieves state-of-the-art results by refining each sample individually
to produce high-quality completions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to apply meta-auxiliary test-time adaptation to point cloud
completion.

Conclusion: 视觉基础模型可有效处理PPG信号，为生理信号分析开辟了新途径，具有良好泛化能力和计算效率

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor in wearable and clinical devices provides
valuable physiological insights in a non-invasive and real-time fashion.
Specialized Foundation Models (FM) or repurposed time-series FMs are used to
benchmark physiological tasks. Our experiments with fine-tuning FMs reveal that
Vision FM (VFM) can also be utilized for this purpose and, in fact,
surprisingly leads to state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on many tasks,
notably blood pressure estimation. We leverage VFMs by simply transforming
one-dimensional PPG signals into image-like two-dimensional representations,
such as the Short-Time Fourier transform (STFT). Using the latest VFMs, such as
DINOv3 and SIGLIP-2, we achieve promising performance on other vital signs and
blood lab measurement tasks as well. Our proposal, Vision4PPG, unlocks a new
class of FMs to achieve SOTA performance with notable generalization to other
2D input representations, including STFT phase and recurrence plots. Our work
improves upon prior investigations of vision models for PPG by conducting a
comprehensive study, comparing them to state-of-the-art time-series FMs, and
demonstrating the general PPG processing ability by reporting results on six
additional tasks. Thus, we provide clinician-scientists with a new set of
powerful tools that is also computationally efficient, thanks to
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques.

Abstract: Pavement crack detection has long depended on costly and time-intensive
pixel-level annotations, which limit its scalability for large-scale
infrastructure monitoring. To overcome this barrier, this paper examines the
feasibility of achieving effective pixel-level crack segmentation entirely
without manual annotations. Building on this objective, a fully self-supervised
framework, Crack-Segmenter, is developed, integrating three complementary
modules: the Scale-Adaptive Embedder (SAE) for robust multi-scale feature
extraction, the Directional Attention Transformer (DAT) for maintaining linear
crack continuity, and the Attention-Guided Fusion (AGF) module for adaptive
feature integration. Through evaluations on ten public datasets,
Crack-Segmenter consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art supervised methods
across all major metrics, including mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice
score, XOR, and Hausdorff Distance (HD). These findings demonstrate that
annotation-free crack detection is not only feasible but also superior,
enabling transportation agencies and infrastructure managers to conduct
scalable and cost-effective monitoring. This work advances self-supervised
learning and motivates pavement cracks detection research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN作为黑盒模型难以解释决策过程，容易受到背景信息的偏见影响，需要开发方法来识别这些隐藏偏见。

Method: 提出两种方法：1）将图像分割成非重叠小块并随机打乱；2）应用傅里叶变换、小波变换和中值滤波器等图像变换技术来恢复背景噪声信息。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效识别CNN中的数据集偏见，区分有用上下文信息和干扰性背景噪声，提高模型可解释性。

Abstract: CNNs are now prevalent as the primary choice for most machine vision problems
due to their superior rate of classification and the availability of
user-friendly libraries. These networks effortlessly identify and select
features in a non-intuitive data-driven manner, making it difficult to
determine which features were most influential. That leads to a ``black box",
where users cannot know how the image data are analyzed but rely on empirical
results. Therefore the decision-making process can be biased by background
information that is difficult to detect. Here we discuss examples of such
hidden biases and propose techniques for identifying them, methods to
distinguish between contextual information and background noise, and explore
whether CNNs learn from irrelevant features. One effective approach to identify
dataset bias is to classify blank background parts of the images. However, in
some situations a blank background in the images is not available, making it
more difficult to separate the foreground information from the blank
background. Such parts of the image can also be considered contextual learning,
not necessarily bias. To overcome this, we propose two approaches that were
tested on six different datasets, including natural, synthetic, and hybrid
datasets. The first method involves dividing images into smaller,
non-overlapping tiles of various sizes, which are then shuffled randomly,
making classification more challenging. The second method involves the
application of several image transforms, including Fourier, Wavelet transforms,
and Median filter, and their combinations. These transforms help recover
background noise information used by CNN to classify images. Results indicate
that this method can effectively distinguish between contextual information and
background noise, and alert on the presence of background noise even without
the need to use background information.

Conclusion: Mesh-Gait通过创新的3D热图重建方法，有效解决了步态识别中的视角变化和计算效率问题，为实时应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Gait recognition, a fundamental biometric technology, leverages unique
walking patterns for individual identification, typically using 2D
representations such as silhouettes or skeletons. However, these methods often
struggle with viewpoint variations, occlusions, and noise. Multi-modal
approaches that incorporate 3D body shape information offer improved robustness
but are computationally expensive, limiting their feasibility for real-time
applications. To address these challenges, we introduce Mesh-Gait, a novel
end-to-end multi-modal gait recognition framework that directly reconstructs 3D
representations from 2D silhouettes, effectively combining the strengths of
both modalities. Compared to existing methods, directly learning 3D features
from 3D joints or meshes is complex and difficult to fuse with silhouette-based
gait features. To overcome this, Mesh-Gait reconstructs 3D heatmaps as an
intermediate representation, enabling the model to effectively capture 3D
geometric information while maintaining simplicity and computational
efficiency. During training, the intermediate 3D heatmaps are gradually
reconstructed and become increasingly accurate under supervised learning, where
the loss is calculated between the reconstructed 3D joints, virtual markers,
and 3D meshes and their corresponding ground truth, ensuring precise spatial
alignment and consistent 3D structure. Mesh-Gait extracts discriminative
features from both silhouettes and reconstructed 3D heatmaps in a
computationally efficient manner. This design enables the model to capture
spatial and structural gait characteristics while avoiding the heavy overhead
of direct 3D reconstruction from RGB videos, allowing the network to focus on
motion dynamics rather than irrelevant visual details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mesh-Gait achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. The code will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Image feature matching plays a vital role in many computer vision tasks.
Although many image feature detection and matching techniques have been
proposed over the past few decades, it is still time-consuming to match feature
points in two images, especially for images with a large number of detected
features. Feature spatial order can estimate the probability that a pair of
features is correct. Since it is a completely independent concept from epipolar
geometry, it can be used to complement epipolar geometry in guiding feature
match in a target region so as to improve matching efficiency. In this paper,
we integrate the concept of feature spatial order into a progressive matching
framework. We use some of the initially matched features to build a
computational model of feature spatial order and employs it to calculates the
possible spatial range of subsequent feature matches, thus filtering out
unnecessary feature matches. We also integrate it with epipolar geometry to
further improve matching efficiency and accuracy. Since the spatial order of
feature points is affected by image rotation, we propose a suitable image
alignment method from the fundamental matrix of epipolar geometry to remove the
effect of image rotation. To verify the feasibility of the proposed method, we
conduct a series of experiments, including a standard benchmark dataset,
self-generated simulated images, and real images. The results demonstrate that
our proposed method is significantly more efficient and has more accurate
feature matching than the traditional method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前步态识别方法通常只关注2D或3D单一模态，无法充分捕捉人类行走模式的几何和动态复杂性。

Method: 使用多模态多任务框架，结合2D时间轮廓和3D SMPL特征，通过统一transformer融合特征，同时进行步态识别和年龄、BMI、性别等属性估计。

Result: 在BRIAR数据集上的实验表明，该方法在远距离（达1公里）和极端俯仰角（达50度）等挑战性条件下优于现有方法，并能准确估计人体属性。

Conclusion: 多模态和多任务学习为现实场景中基于步态的人类理解提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Gait recognition is an important biometric for human identification at a
distance, particularly under low-resolution or unconstrained environments.
Current works typically focus on either 2D representations (e.g., silhouettes
and skeletons) or 3D representations (e.g., meshes and SMPLs), but relying on a
single modality often fails to capture the full geometric and dynamic
complexity of human walking patterns. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal
and multi-task framework that combines 2D temporal silhouettes with 3D SMPL
features for robust gait analysis. Beyond identification, we introduce a
multitask learning strategy that jointly performs gait recognition and human
attribute estimation, including age, body mass index (BMI), and gender. A
unified transformer is employed to effectively fuse multi-modal gait features
and better learn attribute-related representations, while preserving
discriminative identity cues. Extensive experiments on the large-scale BRIAR
datasets, collected under challenging conditions such as long-range distances
(up to 1 km) and extreme pitch angles (up to 50{\deg}), demonstrate that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in gait recognition and provides
accurate human attribute estimation. These results highlight the promise of
multi-modal and multitask learning for advancing gait-based human understanding
in real-world scenarios.

*Jyotirmay Nag Setu,Kevin Desai,John Quarles*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究使用迁移学习和LSTM网络从VR游戏视频中提取视觉特征，预测网络晕动症的严重程度，准确率达到68.4%，超越了仅使用视频数据的现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着VR技术的快速发展，网络晕动症（类似晕动病的症状）持续阻碍VR的广泛接受。虽然已有研究探索多模态深度学习方法，但基于视频特征预测网络晕动症的研究仍然有限。

Method: 使用在ImageNet数据集上预训练的InceptionV3模型通过迁移学习从VR游戏视频中提取高级视觉特征，然后将这些特征输入LSTM网络以捕捉VR体验的时间动态并预测网络晕动症严重程度。

Result: 该方法有效利用了视频数据的时间序列特性，在网络晕动症严重程度分类上达到了68.4%的准确率，超越了仅使用视频数据的现有模型性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为VR开发者提供了一个实用的工具来评估和缓解虚拟环境中的网络晕动症，并为未来基于视频的时间建模研究以增强VR应用的用户舒适度奠定了基础。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of virtual reality (VR) technology, its adoption
across domains such as healthcare, education, and entertainment has grown
significantly. However, the persistent issue of cybersickness, marked by
symptoms resembling motion sickness, continues to hinder widespread acceptance
of VR. While recent research has explored multimodal deep learning approaches
leveraging data from integrated VR sensors like eye and head tracking, there
remains limited investigation into the use of video-based features for
predicting cybersickness. In this study, we address this gap by utilizing
transfer learning to extract high-level visual features from VR gameplay videos
using the InceptionV3 model pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. These features
are then passed to a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture the
temporal dynamics of the VR experience and predict cybersickness severity over
time. Our approach effectively leverages the time-series nature of video data,
achieving a 68.4% classification accuracy for cybersickness severity. This
surpasses the performance of existing models trained solely on video data,
providing a practical tool for VR developers to evaluate and mitigate
cybersickness in virtual environments. Furthermore, this work lays the
foundation for future research on video-based temporal modeling for enhancing
user comfort in VR applications.

*Suyang Xi,Chenxi Yang,Hong Ding,Yiqing Ni,Catherine C. Liu,Yunhao Liu,Chengqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HuLiRAG是一个类人检索增强生成框架，通过"什么-哪里-重加权"级联方法解决多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉问答中的幻觉问题，提高定位保真度和事实一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉问答中经常产生关于物体身份、位置和关系的幻觉，因为文本查询没有明确锚定到视觉参照物。现有的检索增强生成方法只关注全局图像信息，缺乏局部细节和细粒度交互推理。

Method: 提出HuLiRAG框架，将多模态推理分为三个级联步骤：通过开放词汇检测锚定候选参照物（什么），使用SAM衍生掩码进行空间解析恢复细粒度精度（哪里），通过局部与全局对齐的权衡自适应优先排序（重加权）。通过掩码引导微调将空间证据注入生成过程。

Result: 广泛实验表明，这种类人级联方法提高了定位保真度和事实一致性，同时减少了幻觉，推动了多模态问答向可信推理发展。

Conclusion: HuLiRAG通过将定位从被动偏置转变为答案制定的显式约束，显著改善了多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉问答中的性能，为实现可信推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often fail in fine-grained visual
question answering, producing hallucinations about object identities,
positions, and relations because textual queries are not explicitly anchored to
visual referents. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) alleviates some errors,
but it fails to align with human-like processing at both the retrieval and
augmentation levels. Specifically, it focuses only on global-level image
information but lacks local detail and limits reasoning about fine-grained
interactions. To overcome this limitation, we present Human-Like
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HuLiRAG), a framework that stages multimodal
reasoning as a ``what--where--reweight'' cascade. Queries are first anchored to
candidate referents via open-vocabulary detection (what), then spatially
resolved with SAM-derived masks to recover fine-grained precision (where), and
adaptively prioritized through the trade-off between local and global alignment
(reweight). Mask-guided fine-tuning further injects spatial evidence into the
generation process, transforming grounding from a passive bias into an explicit
constraint on answer formulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this
human-like cascade improves grounding fidelity and factual consistency while
reducing hallucinations, advancing multimodal question answering toward
trustworthy reasoning.

*Kangjian Zhu,Haobo Jiang,Yigong Zhang,Jianjun Qian,Jian Yang,Jin Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonoSE(3)-Diffusion是一个单目SE(3)扩散框架，将无标记、基于图像的机器人姿态估计建模为条件去噪扩散过程，包含可见性约束的扩散过程和时序感知的反向过程，在DREAM和RoboKeyGen基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法使用固定尺度的扰动，缺乏多样性且可能超出相机视野，限制了网络泛化能力。需要一种能够生成视野内多样化训练姿态的方法，并提高姿态估计的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1) 可见性约束扩散过程，将真实姿态逐步扰动为噪声变换，确保变换保持在相机视野内；2) 时序感知反向过程，通过去噪网络迭代预测姿态，并按照粗到细的调度程序从扩散后验中采样进行姿态精炼。

Result: 在两个基准测试(DREAM和RoboKeyGen)上均取得改进，在最具挑战性的数据集上达到66.75的AUC，比现有最优方法提升了32.3%。

Conclusion: MonoSE(3)-Diffusion通过可见性约束扩散和时序感知反向过程，显著提高了单目机器人姿态估计的准确性和鲁棒性，证明了扩散模型在姿态估计任务中的有效性。

Abstract: We propose MonoSE(3)-Diffusion, a monocular SE(3) diffusion framework that
formulates markerless, image-based robot pose estimation as a conditional
denoising diffusion process. The framework consists of two processes: a
visibility-constrained diffusion process for diverse pose augmentation and a
timestep-aware reverse process for progressive pose refinement. The diffusion
process progressively perturbs ground-truth poses to noisy transformations for
training a pose denoising network. Importantly, we integrate visibility
constraints into the process, ensuring the transformations remain within the
camera field of view. Compared to the fixed-scale perturbations used in current
methods, the diffusion process generates in-view and diverse training poses,
thereby improving the network generalization capability. Furthermore, the
reverse process iteratively predicts the poses by the denoising network and
refines pose estimates by sampling from the diffusion posterior of current
timestep, following a scheduled coarse-to-fine procedure. Moreover, the
timestep indicates the transformation scales, which guide the denoising network
to achieve more accurate pose predictions. The reverse process demonstrates
higher robustness than direct prediction, benefiting from its timestep-aware
refinement scheme. Our approach demonstrates improvements across two benchmarks
(DREAM and RoboKeyGen), achieving a notable AUC of 66.75 on the most
challenging dataset, representing a 32.3% gain over the state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: 提出了CoDeGraph算法，通过检测和过滤一致性异常来改进零样本图像异常分类和分割，解决了现有方法在处理重复性缺陷时的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于表示的方法在处理一致性异常（跨多个图像重复出现的相似缺陷）时表现不佳，导致异常分类和分割性能下降。

Method: 构建图像级图结构，将图像作为节点，通过共享一致性异常模式连接边，利用社区检测过滤异常。基于"邻居耗尽"现象识别一致性异常。

Result: 在MVTec AD数据集上，使用ViT-L-14-336骨干网络实现98.3% AUROC的异常分类性能，分割性能达到66.8% F1和68.1% AP，相比现有方法分别提升4.2%和5.4%。使用DINOv2骨干网络进一步将分割性能提升至69.1% F1和71.9% AP。

Conclusion: CoDeGraph算法通过识别和过滤一致性异常，显著提升了零样本异常检测性能，并在不同骨干网络上表现出鲁棒性。

Abstract: Zero-shot image anomaly classification (AC) and segmentation (AS) are vital
for industrial quality control, detecting defects without prior training data.
Existing representation-based methods compare patch features with nearest
neighbors in unlabeled test images but struggle with consistent anomalies --
similar defects recurring across multiple images -- resulting in poor AC/AS
performance. We introduce Consistent-Anomaly Detection Graph (CoDeGraph), a
novel algorithm that identifies and filters consistent anomalies from
similarity computations. Our key insight is that normal patches in industrial
images show stable, gradually increasing similarity to other test images, while
consistent-anomaly patches exhibit abrupt similarity spikes after exhausting a
limited set of similar matches, a phenomenon we term ``neighbor-burnout.''
CoDeGraph constructs an image-level graph, with images as nodes and edges
connecting those with shared consistent-anomaly patterns, using community
detection to filter these anomalies. We provide a theoretical foundation using
Extreme Value Theory to explain the effectiveness of our approach. Experiments
on MVTec AD with the ViT-L-14-336 backbone achieve 98.3% AUROC for AC and AS
performance of 66.8% (+4.2%) F1 and 68.1% (+5.4%) AP over state-of-the-art
zero-shot methods. Using the DINOv2 backbone further improves segmentation,
yielding 69.1% (+6.5%) F1 and 71.9% (+9.2%) AP, demonstrating robustness across
architectures.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的医学图像分割方法，通过模拟临床专家小组的决策过程来处理标注者间的变异性，将专家分歧视为有用信号而非噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割标注存在标注者间变异性问题，传统方法简单平均专家标签会丢弃临床不确定性信息，需要一种能利用专家分歧的新方法。

Method: 使用群体决策模拟框架，包括专家签名生成器学习个体标注者风格，模拟咨询模块从潜在空间智能采样生成最终分割结果。

Result: 在CBCT和MRI数据集上取得了最先进的结果，Dice分数分别达到92.11%和90.72%。

Conclusion: 通过将专家分歧视为有用信号而非噪声，为构建更稳健和可信的医疗AI系统提供了清晰路径。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation annotation suffers from inter-rater variability
(IRV) due to differences in annotators' expertise and the inherent blurriness
of medical images. Standard approaches that simply average expert labels are
flawed, as they discard the valuable clinical uncertainty revealed in
disagreements. We introduce a fundamentally new approach with our group
decision simulation framework, which works by mimicking the collaborative
decision-making process of a clinical panel. Under this framework, an Expert
Signature Generator (ESG) learns to represent individual annotator styles in a
unique latent space. A Simulated Consultation Module (SCM) then intelligently
generates the final segmentation by sampling from this space. This method
achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging CBCT and MRI datasets (92.11%
and 90.72% Dice scores). By treating expert disagreement as a useful signal
instead of noise, our work provides a clear path toward more robust and
trustworthy AI systems for healthcare.

Motivation: TIPS手术预后结果差异大且肝性脑病发生率高，需要准确的术前预后建模。现有方法面临ROI标注费时、单模态方法可靠性差、单终点预测不完整等问题，且缺乏公开数据集。

Method: 包含三个核心模块：(1)双选项分割：结合半监督和基础模型实现有限标注下的ROI分割；(2)多模态交互：使用多粒度放射组学注意力、渐进正交解缠和临床引导预后增强实现跨模态特征交互；(3)多任务预测：采用分阶段训练策略同时优化生存、门脉压力梯度和肝性脑病预测。

Result: 在MultiTIPS数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法优于现有最先进方法，具有强大的跨域泛化能力和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该框架在临床应用中具有前景，数据集和代码已公开。

Abstract: Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is an established
procedure for portal hypertension, but provides variable survival outcomes and
frequent overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE), indicating the necessity of
accurate preoperative prognostic modeling. Current studies typically build
machine learning models from preoperative CT images or clinical
characteristics, but face three key challenges: (1) labor-intensive
region-of-interest (ROI) annotation, (2) poor reliability and generalizability
of unimodal methods, and (3) incomplete assessment from single-endpoint
prediction. Moreover, the lack of publicly accessible datasets constrains
research in this field. Therefore, we present MultiTIPS, the first public
multi-center dataset for TIPS prognosis, and propose a novel multimodal
prognostic framework based on it. The framework comprises three core modules:
(1) dual-option segmentation, which integrates semi-supervised and foundation
model-based pipelines to achieve robust ROI segmentation with limited
annotations and facilitate subsequent feature extraction; (2) multimodal
interaction, where three techniques, multi-grained radiomics attention (MGRA),
progressive orthogonal disentanglement (POD), and clinically guided prognostic
enhancement (CGPE), are introduced to enable cross-modal feature interaction
and complementary representation integration, thus improving model accuracy and
robustness; and (3) multi-task prediction, where a staged training strategy is
used to perform stable optimization of survival, portal pressure gradient
(PPG), and OHE prediction for comprehensive prognostic assessment. Extensive
experiments on MultiTIPS demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method
over state-of-the-art approaches, along with strong cross-domain generalization
and interpretability, indicating its promise for clinical application. The
dataset and code are available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型(VLMs)面临严重的幻觉问题，即模型倾向于生成语言流畅但与图像内容无关的响应。这主要是由于语言偏见导致的。

Method: 通过自适应地掩码选定的transformer层中最有影响力的图像标记的注意力权重，来退化视觉-语言感知，然后利用原始模型与退化模型输出分布的差异进行解码。

Result: 在幻觉特定基准测试中显著提高了不同VLM的性能，且无需额外条件或训练成本，能够有效泛化。

Conclusion: CMG方法通过强调视觉上下文感知显著减少了语言偏见，同时不损害VLMs的能力，为解决VLM幻觉问题提供了有效的训练免费解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown solid ability for multimodal
understanding of both visual and language contexts. However, existing VLMs
often face severe challenges of hallucinations, meaning that VLMs tend to
generate responses that are only fluent in the language but irrelevant to
images in previous contexts. To address this issue, we analyze how language
bias contributes to hallucinations and then introduce Cross-Modal
Guidance(CMG), a training-free decoding method that addresses the
hallucinations by leveraging the difference between the output distributions of
the original model and the one with degraded visual-language attention. In
practice, we adaptively mask the attention weight of the most influential image
tokens in selected transformer layers to corrupt the visual-language perception
as a concrete type of degradation. Such a degradation-induced decoding
emphasizes the perception of visual contexts and therefore significantly
reduces language bias without harming the ability of VLMs. In experiment
sections, we conduct comprehensive studies. All results demonstrate the
superior advantages of CMG with neither additional conditions nor training
costs. We also quantitatively show CMG can improve different VLM's performance
on hallucination-specific benchmarks and generalize effectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有伪图像表示方法在处理非结构化点云时往往忽视点云的结构和语义细节，导致特征融合和可区分性受限。

Method: 使用全局-局部特征融合编码模块增强局部特征相关性并捕获全局上下文信息；采用多分支特征提取网络获取更多邻域信息并增强轮廓特征可区分性；引入深度特征引导注意力机制提升跨通道特征融合精度。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI和nuScenes验证集上分别达到69.83%和78.65%的准确率，实现了高性能与实时性的平衡。

Conclusion: DAGLFNet在基于LiDAR的实时应用中展现出巨大潜力，能够有效提取区分性特征并实现高效的点云语义分割。

Abstract: Environmental perception systems play a critical role in high-precision
mapping and autonomous navigation, with LiDAR serving as a core sensor that
provides accurate 3D point cloud data. How to efficiently process unstructured
point clouds while extracting structured semantic information remains a
significant challenge, and in recent years, numerous pseudo-image-based
representation methods have emerged to achieve a balance between efficiency and
performance. However, they often overlook the structural and semantic details
of point clouds, resulting in limited feature fusion and discriminability. In
this work, we propose DAGLFNet, a pseudo-image-based semantic segmentation
framework designed to extract discriminative features. First, the Global-Local
Feature Fusion Encoding module is used to enhance the correlation among local
features within a set and capture global contextual information. Second, the
Multi-Branch Feature Extraction network is employed to capture more
neighborhood information and enhance the discriminability of contour features.
Finally, a Feature Fusion via Deep Feature-guided Attention mechanism is
introduced to improve the precision of cross-channel feature fusion.
Experimental evaluations show that DAGLFNet achieves 69.83\% and 78.65\% on the
validation sets of SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, respectively. The method
balances high performance with real-time capability, demonstrating great
potential for LiDAR-based real-time applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MSF-Mamba模型，通过运动感知状态融合增强Mamba在微手势识别中的局部时空建模能力，解决了传统Mamba无法有效建模局部依赖性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微手势识别需要同时建模长程和局部时空依赖关系。CNN擅长局部模式但长程依赖有限，Transformer能处理长程依赖但计算成本高，Mamba虽然高效但缺乏局部时空建模能力。

Method: 提出MSF-Mamba，通过运动感知状态融合模块基于中心帧差分来融合局部上下文相邻状态，增强Mamba的局部时空建模。还提出多尺度版本MSF-Mamba+，支持多尺度运动感知状态融合和自适应尺度加权。

Result: 在两个公开微手势识别数据集上的实验表明，即使是轻量级版本MSF-Mamba也达到了最先进的性能，超越了现有的CNN、Transformer和SSM模型，同时保持高效率。

Conclusion: MSF-Mamba通过运动感知状态融合有效解决了vanilla Mamba在微手势识别中的局限性，能够有效捕捉细微运动线索，在性能和效率方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Micro-gesture recognition (MGR) targets the identification of subtle and
fine-grained human motions and requires accurate modeling of both long-range
and local spatiotemporal dependencies. While CNNs are effective at capturing
local patterns, they struggle with long-range dependencies due to their limited
receptive fields. Transformer-based models address this limitation through
self-attention mechanisms but suffer from high computational costs. Recently,
Mamba has shown promise as an efficient model, leveraging state space models
(SSMs) to enable linear-time processing However, directly applying the vanilla
Mamba to MGR may not be optimal. This is because Mamba processes inputs as 1D
sequences, with state updates relying solely on the previous state, and thus
lacks the ability to model local spatiotemporal dependencies. In addition,
previous methods lack a design of motion-awareness, which is crucial in MGR. To
overcome these limitations, we propose motion-aware state fusion mamba
(MSF-Mamba), which enhances Mamba with local spatiotemporal modeling by fusing
local contextual neighboring states. Our design introduces a motion-aware state
fusion module based on central frame difference (CFD). Furthermore, a
multiscale version named MSF-Mamba+ has been proposed. Specifically, MSF-Mamba
supports multiscale motion-aware state fusion, as well as an adaptive scale
weighting module that dynamically weighs the fused states across different
scales. These enhancements explicitly address the limitations of vanilla Mamba
by enabling motion-aware local spatiotemporal modeling, allowing MSF-Mamba and
MSF-Mamba to effectively capture subtle motion cues for MGR. Experiments on two
public MGR datasets demonstrate that even the lightweight version, namely,
MSF-Mamba, achieves SoTA performance, outperforming existing CNN-,
Transformer-, and SSM-based models while maintaining high efficiency.

Conclusion: VLMs确实具备自优化能力，该研究为理解VLMs学习机制提供了新视角，有望启发未来研究。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) integrate visual knowledge with the analytical
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through supervised visual
instruction tuning, using image-question-answer triplets. However, the
potential of VLMs trained without supervised instruction remains largely
unexplored. This study validates that VLMs possess inherent self-refinement
capabilities, enabling them to generate high-quality supervised data without
external inputs and thereby learn autonomously. Specifically, to stimulate the
self-refinement ability of VLMs, we propose a self-refinement framework based
on a Triangular Consistency principle: within the image-query-answer triangle,
any masked elements should be consistently and accurately reconstructed. The
framework involves three steps: (1) We enable the instruction generation
ability of VLMs by adding multi-task instruction tuning like
image$\rightarrow$question-answer or image-answer$\rightarrow$question. (2) We
generate image-query-answer triplets from unlabeled images and use the
Triangular Consistency principle for filtering. (3) The model is further
updated using the filtered synthetic data. To investigate the underlying
mechanisms behind this self-refinement capability, we conduct a theoretical
analysis from a causal perspective. Using the widely recognized LLaVA-1.5 as
our baseline, our experiments reveal that the model can autonomously achieve
consistent, though deliberately modest, improvements across multiple benchmarks
without any external supervision, such as human annotations or environmental
feedback. We expect that the insights of this study on the self-refinement
ability of VLMs can inspire future research on the learning mechanism of VLMs.

Abstract: Transformers rely on explicit positional encoding to model structure in data.
While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) excels in 1D domains, its application to
image generation reveals significant limitations such as fine-grained spatial
relation modeling, color cues, and object counting. This paper identifies key
limitations of standard multi-dimensional RoPE-rigid frequency allocation,
axis-wise independence, and uniform head treatment-in capturing the complex
structural biases required for fine-grained image generation. We propose
HARoPE, a head-wise adaptive extension that inserts a learnable linear
transformation parameterized via singular value decomposition (SVD) before the
rotary mapping. This lightweight modification enables dynamic frequency
reallocation, semantic alignment of rotary planes, and head-specific positional
receptive fields while rigorously preserving RoPE's relative-position property.
Extensive experiments on class-conditional ImageNet and text-to-image
generation (Flux and MMDiT) demonstrate that HARoPE consistently improves
performance over strong RoPE baselines and other extensions. The method serves
as an effective drop-in replacement, offering a principled and adaptable
solution for enhancing positional awareness in transformer-based image
generative models.

TL;DR: Jigsaw3D是一个基于多视角扩散的3D风格迁移方法，通过拼图操作解耦风格与内容，实现快速、视角一致的3D资产风格化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖直接参考风格注入或2D扩散模型分数蒸馏，存在每场景优化成本高、风格与语义内容纠缠的问题

Method: 使用拼图操作（空间打乱和随机掩码参考图像块）抑制对象语义并分离风格统计特征，通过参考到视角的交叉注意力将风格线索集成到多视角扩散模型中

Result: 在标准3D风格化基准测试中，Jigsaw3D实现了高风格保真度和多视角一致性，延迟显著降低，并能泛化到掩码部分参考风格化、多对象场景风格化和可平铺纹理生成

Conclusion: Jigsaw3D通过解耦风格与内容，提供了一种高效且一致的3D风格迁移解决方案

Abstract: Controllable 3D style transfer seeks to restyle a 3D asset so that its
textures match a reference image while preserving the integrity and multi-view
consistency. The prevalent methods either rely on direct reference style token
injection or score-distillation from 2D diffusion models, which incurs heavy
per-scene optimization and often entangles style with semantic content. We
introduce Jigsaw3D, a multi-view diffusion based pipeline that decouples style
from content and enables fast, view-consistent stylization. Our key idea is to
leverage the jigsaw operation - spatial shuffling and random masking of
reference patches - to suppress object semantics and isolate stylistic
statistics (color palettes, strokes, textures). We integrate these style cues
into a multi-view diffusion model via reference-to-view cross-attention,
producing view-consistent stylized renderings conditioned on the input mesh.
The renders are then style-baked onto the surface to yield seamless textures.
Across standard 3D stylization benchmarks, Jigsaw3D achieves high style
fidelity and multi-view consistency with substantially lower latency, and
generalizes to masked partial reference stylization, multi-object scene
styling, and tileable texture generation. Project page is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了VideoReward Thinker (VR-Thinker)框架，通过视觉推理操作和可配置视觉记忆窗口，让多模态奖励模型能够主动获取和更新视觉证据，解决了现有模型因视觉输入消耗大量上下文预算而导致的细节丢失和幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态奖励模型存在两个主要限制：(1) 视觉输入消耗大量上下文预算，导致只能使用较少帧数并丢失细粒度细节；(2) 所有视觉信息都打包到初始提示中，加剧了链式思维推理中的幻觉和遗忘问题。

Method: 采用强化微调流程：1) 冷启动使用精心策划的视觉链式思维数据来提炼基本推理技能和操作格式化；2) 选择所有维度判断都正确的样本，对这些高质量轨迹进行拒绝采样微调；3) 应用组相对策略优化来加强推理能力。

Result: 在视频偏好基准测试中达到最先进准确率，特别是对于较长视频：7B VR-Thinker在VideoGen Reward上达到80.5%，在GenAI-Bench上达到82.3%，在MJ-Bench-Video上达到75.6%。

Conclusion: 验证了基于图像思维的多模态奖励建模方法的有效性和前景，通过主动视觉推理操作显著提升了推理保真度和可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal reward models (RMs) have substantially
improved post-training for visual generative models. However, current RMs face
inherent limitations: (1) visual inputs consume large context budgets, forcing
fewer frames and causing loss of fine-grained details; and (2) all visual
information is packed into the initial prompt, exacerbating hallucination and
forgetting during chain-of-thought reasoning. To overcome these issues, we
introduce VideoReward Thinker (VR-Thinker), a thinking-with-image framework
that equips the RM with visual reasoning operations (e.g., select frame) and a
configurable visual memory window. This allows the RM to actively acquire and
update visual evidence within context limits, improving reasoning fidelity and
reliability. We activate visual reasoning via a reinforcement fine-tuning
pipeline: (i) Cold Start with curated visual chain-of-thought data to distill
basic reasoning skills and operation formatting; (ii) select samples whose
per-dimension and overall judgments are all correct, then conduct Rejection
sampling Fine-Tuning on these high-quality traces to further enhance reasoning;
and (iii) apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen
reasoning. Our approach delivers state-of-the-art accuracy among open-source
models on video preference benchmarks, especially for longer videos: a 7B
VR-Thinker achieves 80.5% on VideoGen Reward, 82.3% on GenAI-Bench, and 75.6%
on MJ-Bench-Video. These results validate the effectiveness and promise of
thinking-with-image multimodal reward modeling.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于最优格点向量量化的方法，在固定查找表大小下扩展CNN感受野，通过自适应分配量化分辨率、不规则空洞卷积和U形级联LUT结构来提升快速CNN推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有查找表方法由于组合爆炸问题导致卷积核感受野受限，需要在保持空间复杂度不变的情况下扩展CNN感受野以提升推理性能。

Method: 学习最优格点向量量化器自适应分配量化分辨率；采用不规则空洞卷积；设计U形级联LUT结构捕获多级上下文信息。

Result: 提出的方法在速度、精度和内存效率之间取得更好平衡，相比现有LUT方法有显著改进。

Conclusion: 通过格点向量量化、不规则空洞卷积和U形级联LUT结构的组合创新，有效扩展了CNN感受野，提升了LUT驱动快速CNN推理的性能。

Abstract: Recently, several look-up table (LUT) methods were developed to greatly
expedite the inference of CNNs in a classical strategy of trading space for
speed. However, these LUT methods suffer from a common drawback of limited
receptive field of the convolution kernels due to the combinatorial explosion
of table size. This research aims to expand the CNN receptive field with a
fixed table size, thereby enhancing the performance of LUT-driven fast CNN
inference while maintaining the same space complexity. To achieve this goal,
various techniques are proposed. The main contribution is a novel approach of
learning an optimal lattice vector quantizer that adaptively allocates the
quantization resolution across data dimensions based on their significance to
the inference task. In addition, the lattice vector quantizer offers an
inherently more accurate approximation of CNN kernels than scalar quantizer as
used in current practice. Furthermore, we introduce other receptive field
expansion strategies, including irregular dilated convolutions and a U-shaped
cascaded LUT structure, designed to capture multi-level contextual information
without inflating table size. Together, these innovations allow our approach to
effectively balance speed, accuracy, and memory efficiency, demonstrating
significant improvements over existing LUT methods.

Conclusion: COSINE通过统一框架成功整合了开放词汇分割和上下文分割，多模态提示的协同作用带来了更好的泛化性能。

Abstract: In this work, we present COSINE, a unified open-world segmentation model that
consolidates open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context segmentation with
multi-modal prompts (e.g., text and image). COSINE exploits foundation models
to extract representations for an input image and corresponding multi-modal
prompts, and a SegDecoder to align these representations, model their
interaction, and obtain masks specified by input prompts across different
granularities. In this way, COSINE overcomes architectural discrepancies,
divergent learning objectives, and distinct representation learning strategies
of previous pipelines for open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context
segmentation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that COSINE has significant
performance improvements in both open-vocabulary and in-context segmentation
tasks. Our exploratory analyses highlight that the synergistic collaboration
between using visual and textual prompts leads to significantly improved
generalization over single-modality approaches.

Conclusion: 通过在识别阶段嵌入模式分析，将计算机视觉和语言建模相结合，为智能交通和监控应用提供了增强的适应性。

Abstract: This work presents a pattern-aware framework for automatic license plate
recognition (ALPR), designed to operate reliably across diverse plate layouts
and challenging real-world conditions. The proposed system consists of a
modern, high-precision detection network followed by a recognition stage that
integrates a transformer-based vision model with an iterative language
modelling mechanism. This unified recognition stage performs character
identification and post-OCR refinement in a seamless process, learning the
structural patterns and formatting rules specific to license plates without
relying on explicit heuristic corrections or manual layout classification.
Through this design, the system jointly optimizes visual and linguistic cues,
enables iterative refinement to improve OCR accuracy under noise, distortion,
and unconventional fonts, and achieves layout-independent recognition across
multiple international datasets (IR-LPR, UFPR-ALPR, AOLP). Experimental results
demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to recent
segmentation-free approaches, highlighting how embedding pattern analysis
within the recognition stage bridges computer vision and language modelling for
enhanced adaptability in intelligent transportation and surveillance
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中模态缺失不平衡导致恶性循环：缺失率高的模态更新次数少，学习进度不一致，特征表示退化，进一步降低其贡献

Method: MCE包含两个组件：1) LCE通过多级因素动态平衡模态特定学习进度；2) RCE通过子集预测和跨模态补全任务提升特征语义和鲁棒性

Result: 在四个多模态基准测试上的综合评估表明，MCE在各种缺失配置下始终优于最先进方法

Conclusion: MCE有效解决了多模态学习中的模态缺失不平衡问题，通过增强模态能力和表示质量显著提升性能

Abstract: Multi-modal learning has made significant advances across diverse pattern
recognition applications. However, handling missing modalities, especially
under imbalanced missing rates, remains a major challenge. This imbalance
triggers a vicious cycle: modalities with higher missing rates receive fewer
updates, leading to inconsistent learning progress and representational
degradation that further diminishes their contribution. Existing methods
typically focus on global dataset-level balancing, often overlooking critical
sample-level variations in modality utility and the underlying issue of
degraded feature quality. We propose Modality Capability Enhancement (MCE) to
tackle these limitations. MCE includes two synergistic components: i) Learning
Capability Enhancement (LCE), which introduces multi-level factors to
dynamically balance modality-specific learning progress, and ii) Representation
Capability Enhancement (RCE), which improves feature semantics and robustness
through subset prediction and cross-modal completion tasks. Comprehensive
evaluations on four multi-modal benchmarks show that MCE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods under various missing configurations. The

TL;DR: GLOFNet是一个用于冰川湖溃决洪水监测和预测的多模态数据集，整合了Sentinel-2多光谱影像、NASA冰川速度产品和MODIS地表温度数据，专注于喀喇昆仑山脉的希斯珀冰川。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冰川湖溃决洪水是高山地区罕见但破坏性强的灾害，现有研究受限于碎片化和单模态数据，缺乏预测能力。需要结合视觉指标和物理前兆的协调数据集来支持预测研究。

Method: 整合三种互补数据源：Sentinel-2多光谱影像用于空间监测，NASA ITS_LIVE速度产品用于冰川运动学，MODIS地表温度记录覆盖20多年。预处理包括云掩膜、质量过滤、归一化、时间插值、数据增强和周期性编码，然后进行多模态协调。

Result: 探索性分析揭示了冰川速度的季节性周期、每十年约0.8K的长期升温趋势，以及冰冻圈条件的空间异质性。GLOFNet数据集已公开可用。

Conclusion: GLOFNet通过解决类别不平衡、云污染和粗分辨率等挑战，为罕见灾害预测的多模态深度学习方法提供了结构化基准测试基础。

Abstract: Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) are rare but destructive hazards in high
mountain regions, yet predictive research is hindered by fragmented and
unimodal data. Most prior efforts emphasize post-event mapping, whereas
forecasting requires harmonized datasets that combine visual indicators with
physical precursors. We present GLOFNet, a multimodal dataset for GLOF
monitoring and prediction, focused on the Shisper Glacier in the Karakoram. It
integrates three complementary sources: Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery for
spatial monitoring, NASA ITS_LIVE velocity products for glacier kinematics, and
MODIS Land Surface Temperature records spanning over two decades. Preprocessing
included cloud masking, quality filtering, normalization, temporal
interpolation, augmentation, and cyclical encoding, followed by harmonization
across modalities. Exploratory analysis reveals seasonal glacier velocity
cycles, long-term warming of ~0.8 K per decade, and spatial heterogeneity in
cryospheric conditions. The resulting dataset, GLOFNet, is publicly available
to support future research in glacial hazard prediction. By addressing
challenges such as class imbalance, cloud contamination, and coarse resolution,
GLOFNet provides a structured foundation for benchmarking multimodal deep
learning approaches to rare hazard prediction.

Abstract: Aiming at the problems of missed detection, false detection and low detection
efficiency in transmission line foreign object detection under railway
environment, we proposed an improved algorithm MRS-YOLO based on YOLO11.
Firstly, a multi-scale Adaptive Kernel Depth Feature Fusion (MAKDF) module is
proposed and fused with the C3k2 module to form C3k2_MAKDF, which enhances the
model's feature extraction capability for foreign objects of different sizes
and shapes. Secondly, a novel Re-calibration Feature Fusion Pyramid Network
(RCFPN) is designed as a neck structure to enhance the model's ability to
integrate and utilize multi-level features effectively. Then, Spatial and
Channel Reconstruction Detect Head (SC_Detect) based on spatial and channel
preprocessing is designed to enhance the model's overall detection performance.
Finally, the channel pruning technique is used to reduce the redundancy of the
improved model, drastically reduce Parameters and Giga Floating Point

Abstract: Weed species classification represents an important step for the development
of automated targeting systems that allow the adoption of precision agriculture
practices. To reduce costs and yield losses caused by their presence. The
identification of weeds is a challenging problem due to their shared
similarities with crop plants and the variability related to the differences in
terms of their types. Along with the variations in relation to changes in field
conditions. Moreover, to fully benefit from deep learning-based methods, large
fully annotated datasets are needed. This requires time intensive and laborious
process for data labeling, which represents a limitation in agricultural
applications. Hence, for the aim of improving the utilization of the unlabeled
data, regarding conditions of scarcity in terms of the labeled data available
during the learning phase and provide robust and high classification
performance. We propose a deep semi-supervised approach, that combines
consistency regularization with similarity learning. Through our developed deep
auto-encoder architecture, experiments realized on the DeepWeeds dataset and

Conclusion: UniFlow通过语义特征作为视觉条件有效缓解了理解和生成之间的训练冲突，实现了双赢结果。

Abstract: Tokenizer is a crucial component for both visual understanding and
generation. To advance toward the ultimate goal of universal modeling, recent
research has focused on developing a unified tokenizer. However, existing
tokenizers face a significant performance trade-off between understanding and
generation, stemming from the inherent conflict between high-level semantic
abstraction and low-level pixel reconstruction. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a generic and unified tokenizer, namely UniFlow, by flexibly adapting
any visual encoder with a concise reconstruction decoder. Specifically, we
introduce layer-wise adaptive self-distillation applied to the well-pretrained
visual encoders, which enables UniFlow to simultaneously inherit the strong
semantic features for visual understanding and flexibly adapt to model
fine-grained details for visual generation. Moreover, we propose a lightweight
patch-wise pixel flow decoder, which efficiently achieves high-fidelity pixel
reconstruction by modeling a conditional flow from the noisy state back to the
patch-wise pixel domain. By leveraging the semantic features as visual
conditions for the decoder, we effectively alleviate the training conflicts
between understanding and generation. Furthermore, the patch-wise learning
strategy simplifies the data distribution, thereby improving training
efficiency. Extensive experiments across 13 challenging benchmarks spanning 7
widely studied visual understanding and generation tasks demonstrate that
UniFlow achieves a win-win outcome. For instance, our 7B UniFlow-XL not only
surpasses the 14B TokenFlow-XL by 7.75% on average understanding benchmarks,
but also achieves competitive results in both visual reconstruction and
generation, surpassing UniTok by 0.15 in rFID and 0.09 in gFID (without
guidance), respectively.

Result: 提出的Diff-ABFlow框架能够有效处理高速和低光场景下的光流估计问题。

Conclusion: 基于扩散模型的外观-边界融合方法为退化场景下的光流估计提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Optical flow estimation has achieved promising results in conventional scenes
but faces challenges in high-speed and low-light scenes, which suffer from
motion blur and insufficient illumination. These conditions lead to weakened
texture and amplified noise and deteriorate the appearance saturation and
boundary completeness of frame cameras, which are necessary for motion feature
matching. In degraded scenes, the frame camera provides dense appearance
saturation but sparse boundary completeness due to its long imaging time and
low dynamic range. In contrast, the event camera offers sparse appearance
saturation, while its short imaging time and high dynamic range gives rise to
dense boundary completeness. Traditionally, existing methods utilize feature
fusion or domain adaptation to introduce event to improve boundary
completeness. However, the appearance features are still deteriorated, which
severely affects the mostly adopted discriminative models that learn the
mapping from visual features to motion fields and generative models that
generate motion fields based on given visual features. So we introduce
diffusion models that learn the mapping from noising flow to clear flow, which
is not affected by the deteriorated visual features. Therefore, we propose a
novel optical flow estimation framework Diff-ABFlow based on diffusion models
with frame-event appearance-boundary fusion.

Motivation: 预训练视觉基础模型在计算机视觉任务中表现出色，但其在OOD检测任务中的潜力尚未充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白，系统研究基础模型在OOD检测中的应用。

Method: 首先评估预训练DINOv2模型在OOD检测中的表现，然后针对大语义空间场景提出MoFE模块（将特征划分为子空间）和Dynamic-β Mixup策略（从动态beta分布采样插值权重）。

Result: 实验表明，预训练DINOv2模型无需微调即可达到现有SOTA方法的性能。提出的MoFE和Dynamic-β Mixup策略显著优于基线方法，特别是在大语义空间场景下。

Conclusion: 预训练视觉基础模型为OOD检测提供了强大的特征表示能力，而MoFE模块和Dynamic-β Mixup策略能有效解决大语义空间带来的挑战，显著提升检测性能。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision foundation models have transformed many computer vision
tasks. Despite their strong ability to learn discriminative and generalizable
features crucial for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, their impact on this
task remains underexplored. Motivated by this gap, we systematically
investigate representative vision foundation models for OOD detection. Our
findings reveal that a pre-trained DINOv2 model, even without fine-tuning on
in-domain (ID) data, naturally provides a highly discriminative feature space
for OOD detection, achieving performance comparable to existing
state-of-the-art methods without requiring complex designs. Beyond this, we
explore how fine-tuning foundation models on in-domain (ID) data can enhance
OOD detection. However, we observe that the performance of vision foundation
models remains unsatisfactory in scenarios with a large semantic space. This is
due to the increased complexity of decision boundaries as the number of
categories grows, which complicates the optimization process. To mitigate this,
we propose the Mixture of Feature Experts (MoFE) module, which partitions
features into subspaces, effectively capturing complex data distributions and
refining decision boundaries. Further, we introduce a Dynamic-$\beta$ Mixup
strategy, which samples interpolation weights from a dynamic beta distribution.
This adapts to varying levels of learning difficulty across categories,
improving feature learning for more challenging categories. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, significantly
outperforming baseline methods.

Abstract: Visual grounding aims to predict the locations of target objects specified by
textual descriptions. For this task with linguistic and visual modalities,
there is a latest research line that focuses on only selecting the
linguistic-relevant visual regions for object localization to reduce the
computational overhead. Albeit achieving impressive performance, it is
iteratively performed on different image scales, and at every iteration,
linguistic features and visual features need to be stored in a cache, incurring
extra overhead. To facilitate the implementation, in this paper, we propose a
feature selection-based simple yet effective baseline for visual grounding,
called FSVG. Specifically, we directly encapsulate the linguistic and visual
modalities into an overall network architecture without complicated iterative
procedures, and utilize the language in parallel as guidance to facilitate the
interaction between linguistic modal and visual modal for extracting effective
visual features. Furthermore, to reduce the computational cost, during the

### [104] [ViSurf: Visual Supervised-and-Reinforcement Fine-Tuning for Large Vision-and-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10606)
*Yuqi Liu,Liangyu Chen,Jiazhen Liu,Mingkang Zhu,Zhisheng Zhong,Bei Yu,Jiaya Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViSurf是一个统一的后训练范式，将监督微调(SFT)和强化学习(RLVR)集成在单阶段中，通过向RLVR注入真实标签同时提供外部监督和内部强化，在多个基准测试中优于单独SFT、RLVR和两阶段方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统后训练方法中，SFT依赖外部指导注入知识但性能次优，RLVR利用内部强化提升推理能力但难以处理超出模型知识范围的任务。需要结合两者优势解决各自局限性。

Method: 提出ViSurf统一范式：1) 分析推导SFT和RLVR目标建立统一目标；2) 在RLVR rollout中注入真实标签，同时提供外部监督和内部强化；3) 引入三种新的奖励控制策略稳定优化训练过程。

Result: 在多个多样化基准测试上的广泛实验表明，ViSurf有效优于单独SFT、RLVR和两阶段SFT→RLVR方法。深入分析验证了ViSurf的推导和设计原则。

Conclusion: ViSurf成功整合了SFT和RLVR的优势，提供了一种统一的后训练范式，通过同时利用外部监督和内部强化，显著提升了大型视觉语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Typical post-training paradigms for Large Vision-and-Language Models (LVLMs)
include Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR). SFT leverages external guidance to inject new knowledge,
whereas RLVR utilizes internal reinforcement to enhance reasoning capabilities
and overall performance. However, our analysis reveals that SFT often leads to
sub-optimal performance, while RLVR struggles with tasks that exceed the
model's internal knowledge base. To address these limitations, we propose
ViSurf (\textbf{Vi}sual \textbf{Su}pervised-and-\textbf{R}einforcement
\textbf{F}ine-Tuning), a unified post-training paradigm that integrates the
strengths of both SFT and RLVR within a single stage. We analyze the derivation
of the SFT and RLVR objectives to establish the ViSurf objective, providing a
unified perspective on these two paradigms. The core of ViSurf involves
injecting ground-truth labels into the RLVR rollouts, thereby providing
simultaneous external supervision and internal reinforcement. Furthermore, we
introduce three novel reward control strategies to stabilize and optimize the
training process. Extensive experiments across several diverse benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of ViSurf, outperforming both individual SFT,
RLVR, and two-stage SFT \textrightarrow RLVR. In-depth analysis corroborates
these findings, validating the derivation and design principles of ViSurf.

TL;DR: OmniQuality-R是一个统一奖励建模框架，将多任务质量推理转化为连续可解释的奖励信号，用于策略优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉评估方法通常局限于单一任务，需要解决多任务质量评估的统一框架问题。

Method: 构建推理增强的奖励建模数据集，通过拒绝采样获取信息丰富的规划-推理轨迹，形成CoT数据集用于SFT；应用GRPO进行后训练，使用高斯奖励支持连续分数预测；加入STD过滤和熵门控机制稳定训练。

Result: 在三个关键IQA任务上进行评估：美学质量评估、技术质量评估和图文对齐。

Conclusion: 该框架能够将多维度推理转化为连续可解释的奖励信号，支持多任务视觉质量评估。

Abstract: Current visual evaluation approaches are typically constrained to a single
task. To address this, we propose OmniQuality-R, a unified reward modeling
framework that transforms multi-task quality reasoning into continuous and
interpretable reward signals for policy optimization. Inspired by subjective
experiments, where participants are given task-specific instructions outlining
distinct assessment principles prior to evaluation, we propose OmniQuality-R, a
structured reward modeling framework that transforms multi-dimensional
reasoning into continuous and interpretable reward signals. To enable this, we
construct a reasoning-enhanced reward modeling dataset by sampling informative
plan-reason trajectories via rejection sampling, forming a reliable
chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Building on
this, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for post-training,
using a Gaussian-based reward to support continuous score prediction. To
further stabilize the training and improve downstream generalization, we
incorporate standard deviation (STD) filtering and entropy gating mechanisms
during reinforcement learning. These techniques suppress unstable updates and
reduce variance in policy optimization. We evaluate OmniQuality-R on three key
IQA tasks: aesthetic quality assessment, technical quality evaluation, and
text-image alignment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合框架，通过增强线性注意力的秩和焦点来解决其在图Transformer中表达能力不足的问题，同时保持线性时间复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有线性注意力模型由于低秩投影结构和过于均匀的注意力分布，导致表达能力显著下降，限制了模型的分类能力。

Method: 在值矩阵上附加门控局部图网络分支以增加注意力图的秩；引入可学习的对数幂函数到注意力分数中，减少熵并锐化焦点。

Result: 在同类性和异类性图基准测试中，该方法实现了有竞争力的性能，同时保持了线性注意力的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该混合框架有效增强了线性注意力的表达能力和分类性能，理论上证明了其能提高节点表示的可分离性。

Abstract: Linear attention mechanisms have emerged as efficient alternatives to full
self-attention in Graph Transformers, offering linear time complexity. However,
existing linear attention models often suffer from a significant drop in
expressiveness due to low-rank projection structures and overly uniform
attention distributions. We theoretically prove that these properties reduce
the class separability of node representations, limiting the model's
classification ability. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid framework
that enhances both the rank and focus of attention. Specifically, we enhance
linear attention by attaching a gated local graph network branch to the value
matrix, thereby increasing the rank of the resulting attention map.
Furthermore, to alleviate the excessive smoothing effect inherent in linear
attention, we introduce a learnable log-power function into the attention
scores to reduce entropy and sharpen focus. We theoretically show that this
function decreases entropy in the attention distribution, enhancing the
separability of learned embeddings. Extensive experiments on both homophilic
and heterophilic graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance while preserving the scalability of linear attention.

Conclusion: 将精细运动解耦与基于流的生成建模相结合，为可控说话头视频合成提供了强大的新范式。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking-head generation has advanced rapidly with
diffusion-based generative models, yet producing temporally coherent videos
with fine-grained motion control remains challenging. We propose DEMO, a
flow-matching generative framework for audio-driven talking-portrait video
synthesis that delivers disentangled, high-fidelity control of lip motion, head
pose, and eye gaze. The core contribution is a motion auto-encoder that builds
a structured latent space in which motion factors are independently represented
and approximately orthogonalized. On this disentangled motion space, we apply
optimal-transport-based flow matching with a transformer predictor to generate
temporally smooth motion trajectories conditioned on audio. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks show that DEMO outperforms prior methods
in video realism, lip-audio synchronization, and motion fidelity. These results
demonstrate that combining fine-grained motion disentanglement with flow-based
generative modeling provides a powerful new paradigm for controllable
talking-head video synthesis.

Abstract: For high-stakes applications, like autonomous driving, a safe operation is
necessary to prevent harm, accidents, and failures. Traditionally, difficult
scenarios have been categorized into corner cases and addressed individually.
However, this example-based categorization is not scalable and lacks a data
coverage perspective, neglecting the generalization to training data of machine
learning models. In our work, we propose a novel machine learning approach that
takes the underlying data distribution into account. Based on our novel
perspective, we present a framework for effective corner case recognition for
perception on individual samples. In our evaluation, we show that our approach
(i) unifies existing scenario-based corner case taxonomies under a
distributional perspective, (ii) achieves strong performance on corner case
detection tasks across standard benchmarks for which we extend established
out-of-distribution detection benchmarks, and (iii) enables analysis of
combined corner cases via a newly introduced fog-augmented Lost & Found
dataset. These results provide a principled basis for corner case recognition,
underlining our manual specification-free definition.

Abstract: As one of the fundamental modules in autonomous driving, online
high-definition (HD) maps have attracted significant attention due to their
cost-effectiveness and real-time capabilities. Since vehicles always cruise in
highly dynamic environments, spatial displacement of onboard sensors inevitably
causes shifts in real-time HD mapping results, and such instability poses
fundamental challenges for downstream tasks. However, existing online map
construction models tend to prioritize improving each frame's mapping accuracy,
while the mapping stability has not yet been systematically studied. To fill
this gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
the temporal stability of online HD mapping models. We propose a
multi-dimensional stability evaluation framework with novel metrics for
Presence, Localization, and Shape Stability, integrated into a unified mean
Average Stability (mAS) score. Extensive experiments on 42 models and variants
show that accuracy (mAP) and stability (mAS) represent largely independent
performance dimensions. We further analyze the impact of key model design
choices on both criteria, identifying architectural and training factors that
contribute to high accuracy, high stability, or both. To encourage broader
focus on stability, we will release a public benchmark. Our work highlights the
importance of treating temporal stability as a core evaluation criterion
alongside accuracy, advancing the development of more reliable autonomous
driving systems. The benchmark toolkit, code, and models will be available at
https://stablehdmap.github.io/.

TL;DR: FS-VFM是一个自监督预训练框架，通过3C学习目标（一致性、连贯性、对应性）结合掩码图像建模和实例判别，学习真实人脸的基础表示，在多种人脸安全任务中表现出优异的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用大量未标记的真实人脸数据，学习鲁棒且可迁移的人脸表示，以提升在各种人脸安全任务中的泛化能力。

Method: 提出FS-VFM框架，包含三种学习目标：使用CRFR-P掩码策略实现区域一致性和跨区域连贯性；通过自蒸馏机制耦合掩码图像建模和实例判别建立局部到全局对应关系；使用FS-Adapter轻量适配器进行高效迁移。

Conclusion: FS-VFM是一个可扩展的自监督预训练框架，能够学习真实人脸的基础表示，在多种人脸安全任务中实现优异的泛化性能，同时FS-Adapter提供了高效的迁移方案。

Abstract: With abundant, unlabeled real faces, how can we learn robust and transferable
facial representations to boost generalization across various face security
tasks? We make the first attempt and propose FS-VFM, a scalable self-supervised
pre-training framework, to learn fundamental representations of real face
images. We introduce three learning objectives, namely 3C, that synergize
masked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID), empowering FS-VFM
to encode both local patterns and global semantics of real faces. Specifically,
we formulate various facial masking strategies for MIM and devise a simple yet
effective CRFR-P masking, which explicitly prompts the model to pursue
meaningful intra-region Consistency and challenging inter-region Coherency. We
present a reliable self-distillation mechanism that seamlessly couples MIM with
ID to establish underlying local-to-global Correspondence. After pre-training,
vanilla vision transformers (ViTs) serve as universal Vision Foundation Models
for downstream Face Security tasks: cross-dataset deepfake detection,
cross-domain face anti-spoofing, and unseen diffusion facial forensics. To
efficiently transfer the pre-trained FS-VFM, we further propose FS-Adapter, a
lightweight plug-and-play bottleneck atop the frozen backbone with a novel
real-anchor contrastive objective. Extensive experiments on 11 public
benchmarks demonstrate that our FS-VFM consistently generalizes better than
diverse VFMs, spanning natural and facial domains, fully, weakly, and
self-supervised paradigms, small, base, and large ViT scales, and even
outperforms SOTA task-specific methods, while FS-Adapter offers an excellent
efficiency-performance trade-off. The code and models are available on

Conclusion: 这项工作在一定程度上证明了视频生成模型在真实世界4D交互方面的潜力。

Abstract: Recent Text-to-Video (T2V) models have demonstrated powerful capability in
visual simulation of real-world geometry and physical laws, indicating its
potential as implicit world models. Inspired by this, we explore the
feasibility of leveraging the video generation prior for viewpoint planning
from given 4D scenes, since videos internally accompany dynamic scenes with
natural viewpoints. To this end, we propose a two-stage paradigm to adapt
pre-trained T2V models for viewpoint prediction, in a compatible manner. First,
we inject the 4D scene representation into the pre-trained T2V model via an
adaptive learning branch, where the 4D scene is viewpoint-agnostic and the
conditional generated video embeds the viewpoints visually. Then, we formulate
viewpoint extraction as a hybrid-condition guided camera extrinsic denoising
process. Specifically, a camera extrinsic diffusion branch is further
introduced onto the pre-trained T2V model, by taking the generated video and 4D
scene as input. Experimental results show the superiority of our proposed
method over existing competitors, and ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of our key technical designs. To some extent, this work proves
the potential of video generation models toward 4D interaction in real world.

Abstract: Image-Language Foundation Models (ILFM) have demonstrated remarkable success
in image-text understanding/generation tasks, providing transferable multimodal
representations that generalize across diverse downstream image-based tasks.
The advancement of video-text research has spurred growing interest in
extending image-based models to the video domain. This paradigm, known as
image-to-video transfer learning, succeeds in alleviating the substantial data
and computational requirements associated with training video-language
foundation models from scratch for video-text learning. This survey provides
the first comprehensive review of this emerging field, which begins by
summarizing the widely used ILFM and their capabilities. We then systematically
classify existing image-to-video transfer learning strategies into two
categories: frozen features and modified features, depending on whether the
original representations from ILFM are preserved or undergo modifications.
Building upon the task-specific nature of image-to-video transfer, this survey
methodically elaborates these strategies and details their applications across
a spectrum of video-text learning tasks, ranging from fine-grained (e.g.,
spatio-temporal video grounding) to coarse-grained (e.g., video question
answering). We further present a detailed experimental analysis to investigate
the efficacy of different image-to-video transfer learning paradigms on a range
of downstream video understanding tasks. Finally, we identify prevailing
challenges and highlight promising directions for future research. By offering
a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to establish a
structured roadmap for advancing video-text learning based on existing ILFM,
and to inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain.

Abstract: Multi-modal brain tumor segmentation is critical for clinical diagnosis, and
it requires accurate identification of distinct internal anatomical subregions.
While the recent prompt-based segmentation paradigms enable interactive
experiences for clinicians, existing methods ignore cross-modal correlations
and rely on labor-intensive category-specific prompts, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a
MSM-Seg framework for multi-modal brain tumor segmentation. The MSM-Seg
introduces a novel dual-memory segmentation paradigm that synergistically
integrates multi-modal and inter-slice information with the efficient
category-agnostic prompt for brain tumor understanding. To this end, we first
devise a modality-and-slice memory attention (MSMA) to exploit the cross-modal
and inter-slice relationships among the input scans. Then, we propose a
multi-scale category-agnostic prompt encoder (MCP-Encoder) to provide tumor
region guidance for decoding. Moreover, we devise a modality-adaptive fusion
decoder (MF-Decoder) that leverages the complementary decoding information
across different modalities to improve segmentation accuracy. Extensive
experiments on different MRI datasets demonstrate that our MSM-Seg framework
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-modal metastases and glioma tumor
segmentation. The code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/MSM-Seg.

Conclusion: 动作动态学习和跨时间交互对动作理解研究具有重要意义，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Action understanding, encompassing action detection and anticipation, plays a
crucial role in numerous practical applications. However, untrimmed videos are
often characterized by substantial redundant information and noise. Moreover,
in modeling action understanding, the influence of the agent's intention on the
action is often overlooked. Motivated by these issues, we propose a novel
framework called the State-Specific Model (SSM), designed to unify and enhance
both action detection and anticipation tasks. In the proposed framework, the
Critical State-Based Memory Compression module compresses frame sequences into
critical states, reducing information redundancy. The Action Pattern Learning
module constructs a state-transition graph with multi-dimensional edges to
model action dynamics in complex scenarios, on the basis of which potential
future cues can be generated to represent intention. Furthermore, our
Cross-Temporal Interaction module models the mutual influence between
intentions and past as well as current information through cross-temporal
interactions, thereby refining present and future features and ultimately
realizing simultaneous action detection and anticipation. Extensive experiments
on multiple benchmark datasets -- including EPIC-Kitchens-100, THUMOS'14,
TVSeries, and the introduced Parkinson's Disease Mouse Behaviour (PDMB) dataset
-- demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed framework compared to
other state-of-the-art approaches. These results highlight the importance of
action dynamics learning and cross-temporal interactions, laying a foundation
for future action understanding research.

Conclusion: 所提出的统一框架能够有效处理散焦和运动模糊，实现高质量动态高斯溅射，为从模糊单目视频中生成真实感新视角提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework that allows high-quality dynamic
Gaussian Splatting from both defocused and motion-blurred monocular videos. Due
to the significant difference between the formation processes of defocus blur
and motion blur, existing methods are tailored for either one of them, lacking
the ability to simultaneously deal with both of them. Although the two can be
jointly modeled as blur kernel-based convolution, the inherent difficulty in
estimating accurate blur kernels greatly limits the progress in this direction.
In this work, we go a step further towards this direction. Particularly, we
propose to estimate per-pixel reliable blur kernels using a blur prediction
network that exploits blur-related scene and camera information and is subject
to a blur-aware sparsity constraint. Besides, we introduce a dynamic Gaussian
densification strategy to mitigate the lack of Gaussians for incomplete
regions, and boost the performance of novel view synthesis by incorporating
unseen view information to constrain scene optimization. Extensive experiments
show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in generating
photorealistic novel view synthesis from defocused and motion-blurred monocular
videos. Our code and trained model will be made publicly available.

while simultaneously generating multiple 3D representations: dense point
clouds, multi-view depth maps, camera parameters, surface normals, and 3D
Gaussians. This elegant and unified architecture leverages available prior
information to resolve structural ambiguities and delivers geometrically
consistent 3D outputs in a single forward pass. WorldMirror achieves
state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks from camera, point map,
depth, and surface normal estimation to novel view synthesis, while maintaining
the efficiency of feed-forward inference. Code and models will be publicly

*Yuan Xu,Zimu Zhang,Xiaoxuan Ma,Wentao Zhu,Yu Qiao,Yizhou Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层意图感知框架，通过认知机制建模人类意图并预测详细的情境行为，使用动态图卷积网络捕捉人-环境关系，在VR/AR系统中实现智能行为预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VR/AR系统需要智能适应用户行为以提升交互体验，这需要准确理解人类意图和预测未来情境行为（如注视方向和物体交互），但现有方法缺乏对驱动人-环境交互的认知过程建模。

Method: 分层意图感知框架：给定历史人类动态和场景上下文，首先识别潜在交互目标，然后预测细粒度未来行为；使用动态图卷积网络有效捕捉人-环境关系。

Result: 在真实世界基准测试和实时VR环境中进行广泛实验，在所有指标上实现优越性能，能够实现预测用户行为并相应调整虚拟环境的主动VR系统。

Conclusion: 该框架通过建模认知机制有效预测人类意图和情境行为，为创建响应式VR/AR环境和个性化助手等应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Virtual and augmented reality systems increasingly demand intelligent
adaptation to user behaviors for enhanced interaction experiences. Achieving
this requires accurately understanding human intentions and predicting future
situated behaviors - such as gaze direction and object interactions - which is
vital for creating responsive VR/AR environments and applications like
personalized assistants. However, accurate behavioral prediction demands
modeling the underlying cognitive processes that drive human-environment
interactions. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical, intention-aware
framework that models human intentions and predicts detailed situated behaviors
by leveraging cognitive mechanisms. Given historical human dynamics and the
observation of scene contexts, our framework first identifies potential
interaction targets and forecasts fine-grained future behaviors. We propose a
dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to effectively capture
human-environment relationships. Extensive experiments on challenging
real-world benchmarks and live VR environment demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, achieving superior performance across all metrics and enabling
practical applications for proactive VR systems that anticipate user behaviors
and adapt virtual environments accordingly.

### [118] [Uncovering Anomalous Events for Marine Environmental Monitoring via Visual Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10750)
*Laura Weihl,Nejc Novak,Stefan H. Bengtson,Malte Pedersen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了AURA首个多标注者水下视觉异常检测基准数据集，评估了四种VAD模型在两种海洋场景中的表现，发现当前模型性能差异显著且对训练数据量和正常场景定义敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下视频监测是评估海洋生物多样性的有前景策略，但海量无事件视频使人工检查非常不切实际，需要自动识别有趣或异常事件的方法。

Method: 引入AURA多标注者基准数据集，评估四种基于深度神经网络的水下视觉异常检测模型，采用鲁棒的帧选择策略提取有意义的视频片段。

Result: 当前VAD模型性能差异显著，对训练数据量和定义"正常"场景的视觉内容变异性高度敏感，软标签和共识标签具有重要价值。

Conclusion: 该研究为支持科学探索和可扩展的生物多样性监测提供了实用方法，强调了多标注者基准数据集在评估水下视觉异常检测中的重要性。

Abstract: Underwater video monitoring is a promising strategy for assessing marine
biodiversity, but the vast volume of uneventful footage makes manual inspection
highly impractical. In this work, we explore the use of visual anomaly
detection (VAD) based on deep neural networks to automatically identify
interesting or anomalous events. We introduce AURA, the first multi-annotator
benchmark dataset for underwater VAD, and evaluate four VAD models across two
marine scenes. We demonstrate the importance of robust frame selection
strategies to extract meaningful video segments. Our comparison against
multiple annotators reveals that VAD performance of current models varies
dramatically and is highly sensitive to both the amount of training data and
the variability in visual content that defines "normal" scenes. Our results
highlight the value of soft and consensus labels and offer a practical approach
for supporting scientific exploration and scalable biodiversity monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可解释的人脸相似性度量方法，将全局相似性分解为局部补丁的贡献，无需后处理分析即可提供局部可加性解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏可靠的评估指标，后处理方法对模型实际推理过程的忠实度存在不确定性，这促使设计具有固有可解释性决策过程的模型。

Method: 定义两个人脸图像的相似性为补丁级相似性得分的总和，将全局相似性分解为受限感受野的贡献。

Result: 即使在112x112人脸图像中使用小至28x28的补丁，该方法也能达到竞争力的验证性能，使用56x56补丁时超越了最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可解释的人脸相似性度量，通过局部可加性解释实现了固有可解释性，同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: Understanding how deep neural networks make decisions is crucial for
analyzing their behavior and diagnosing failure cases. In computer vision, a
common approach to improve interpretability is to assign importance to
individual pixels using post-hoc methods. Although they are widely used to
explain black-box models, their fidelity to the model's actual reasoning is
uncertain due to the lack of reliable evaluation metrics. This limitation
motivates an alternative approach, which is to design models whose decision
processes are inherently interpretable. To this end, we propose a face
similarity metric that breaks down global similarity into contributions from
restricted receptive fields. Our method defines the similarity between two face
images as the sum of patch-level similarity scores, providing a locally
additive explanation without relying on post-hoc analysis. We show that the
proposed approach achieves competitive verification performance even with
patches as small as 28x28 within 112x112 face images, and surpasses
state-of-the-art methods when using 56x56 patches.

Abstract: Identifying drones and birds correctly is essential for keeping the skies
safe and improving security systems. Using the VIP CUP 2025 dataset, which
provides both RGB and infrared (IR) images, this study presents EGD-YOLOv8n, a
new lightweight yet powerful model for object detection. The model improves how
image features are captured and understood, making detection more accurate and
efficient. It uses smart design changes and attention layers to focus on
important details while reducing the amount of computation needed. A special
detection head helps the model adapt to objects of different shapes and sizes.
We trained three versions: one using RGB images, one using IR images, and one
combining both. The combined model achieved the best accuracy and reliability
while running fast enough for real-time use on common GPUs.

*Theo Di Piazza,Carole Lazarus,Olivier Nempont,Loic Boussel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于图的2.5D框架，将3D胸部CT表示为结构化图，通过谱图卷积处理轴向切片三元组，在保持临床部署可行性的同时捕捉切片间依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着CT检查量增加，需要自动化工具支持放射科医生。现有3D CNN方法难以捕捉长程依赖，Vision Transformers需要大量领域特定预训练。

Method: 将3D CT体积表示为结构化图，以轴向切片三元组为节点，通过谱图卷积处理，考虑切片间依赖关系。

Result: 在3个独立机构数据集上训练评估，展现出强大的跨数据集泛化能力，性能与最先进视觉编码器相当。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持计算效率的同时有效处理3D CT数据，具有临床部署潜力，并在放射学报告生成和腹部CT数据上展示了更广泛适用性。

Abstract: With the growing volume of CT examinations, there is an increasing demand for
automated tools such as organ segmentation, abnormality detection, and report
generation to support radiologists in managing their clinical workload.
Multi-label classification of 3D Chest CT scans remains a critical yet
challenging problem due to the complex spatial relationships inherent in
volumetric data and the wide variability of abnormalities. Existing methods
based on 3D convolutional neural networks struggle to capture long-range
dependencies, while Vision Transformers often require extensive pre-training on
large-scale, domain-specific datasets to perform competitively. In this work,
we propose a 2.5D alternative by introducing a new graph-based framework that
represents 3D CT volumes as structured graphs, where axial slice triplets serve
as nodes processed through spectral graph convolution, enabling the model to
reason over inter-slice dependencies while maintaining complexity compatible
with clinical deployment. Our method, trained and evaluated on 3 datasets from
independent institutions, achieves strong cross-dataset generalization, and
shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art visual encoders. We
further conduct comprehensive ablation studies to evaluate the impact of
various aggregation strategies, edge-weighting schemes, and graph connectivity
patterns. Additionally, we demonstrate the broader applicability of our
approach through transfer experiments on automated radiology report generation
and abdominal CT data.\\ This work extends our previous contribution presented
at the MICCAI 2025 EMERGE Workshop.

*Sneha Varur,Anirudh R Hanchinamani,Tarun S Bagewadi,Uma Mudenagudi,Chaitra D Desai,Sujata C,Padmashree Desai,Sumit Meharwade*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DISC-GAN框架，通过风格-内容解耦和聚类特定训练策略实现逼真的水下图像合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像合成质量受颜色衰减和浑浊等光学现象影响，这些现象在不同水域表现为不同的风格变化。现有生成模型难以建模多样水下环境的非均匀条件。

Method: 使用K-means聚类将数据集划分为风格特定域；采用分离编码器获取风格和内容的潜在空间；通过AdaIN整合潜在表示并解码生成最终合成图像；在每个风格簇上独立训练以保持域特定特征。

Result: 取得最先进性能：SSIM为0.9012，平均PSNR为32.5118 dB，FID为13.3728。

Conclusion: DISC-GAN框架能有效合成逼真的水下图像，在多个评估指标上表现优异。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Disentangled Style-Content GAN
(DISC-GAN), which integrates style-content disentanglement with a
cluster-specific training strategy towards photorealistic underwater image
synthesis. The quality of synthetic underwater images is challenged by optical
due to phenomena such as color attenuation and turbidity. These phenomena are
represented by distinct stylistic variations across different waterbodies, such
as changes in tint and haze. While generative models are well-suited to capture
complex patterns, they often lack the ability to model the non-uniform
conditions of diverse underwater environments. To address these challenges, we
employ K-means clustering to partition a dataset into style-specific domains.
We use separate encoders to get latent spaces for style and content; we further
integrate these latent representations via Adaptive Instance Normalization
(AdaIN) and decode the result to produce the final synthetic image. The model
is trained independently on each style cluster to preserve domain-specific
characteristics. Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance,
obtaining a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.9012, an average Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 32.5118 dB, and a Frechet Inception Distance
(FID) of 13.3728.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出imHead，一种新颖的隐式3D可变形模型，能够建模表达性3D头部化身并支持面部特征的局部编辑，通过引入区域特定的潜在表示实现紧凑的身份空间和局部编辑能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D可变形模型受限于严格拓扑结构和线性特性，难以表示复杂的全头形状，且现有方法将潜在空间划分为局部组件导致潜在维度过大。

Method: 保留单一紧凑身份空间，引入中间区域特定潜在表示来实现局部编辑，使用4K个不同身份的大规模数据集进行训练。

Result: 实验证明模型能够表示多样化的身份和表情，性能优于先前方法，同时提供可解释的3D面部操作解决方案。

Conclusion: imHead模型在表达能力和局部编辑方面表现出色，为大规模3D头部建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Over the last years, 3D morphable models (3DMMs) have emerged as a
state-of-the-art methodology for modeling and generating expressive 3D avatars.
However, given their reliance on a strict topology, along with their linear
nature, they struggle to represent complex full-head shapes. Following the
advent of deep implicit functions, we propose imHead, a novel implicit 3DMM
that not only models expressive 3D head avatars but also facilitates localized
editing of the facial features. Previous methods directly divided the latent
space into local components accompanied by an identity encoding to capture the
global shape variations, leading to expensive latent sizes. In contrast, we
retain a single compact identity space and introduce an intermediate
region-specific latent representation to enable local edits. To train imHead,
we curate a large-scale dataset of 4K distinct identities, making a
step-towards large scale 3D head modeling. Under a series of experiments we
demonstrate the expressive power of the proposed model to represent diverse
identities and expressions outperforming previous approaches. Additionally, the
proposed approach provides an interpretable solution for 3D face manipulation,
allowing the user to make localized edits.

TL;DR: 本文提供了MDA231人类乳腺癌细胞3D时间序列分割注释数据集的详细描述和补充实验，验证了注释质量并与现有自动分割方法进行比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量的公开分割注释对图像处理领域至关重要，特别是对于具有复杂动态形状的迁移细胞的3D体积图像注释非常耗时且具有挑战性。

Method: 三名不同标注者对Cell Tracking Challenge中的MDA231人类乳腺癌细胞序列进行全3D时间序列分割注释，并与CTC提供的跟踪标记和自动生成的银标准进行比较。

Result: 创建的注释与CTC发布的跟踪标记一致，分割精度在标注者间变异性范围内，且比自动生成的银标准更好地反映了输入图像的复杂性。

Conclusion: 该3D注释数据集可用于测试和训练细胞分割算法，或分析高度动态物体的3D形状，为领域提供了有价值的公开资源。

Abstract: High-quality, publicly available segmentation annotations of image and video
datasets are critical for advancing the field of image processing. In
particular, annotations of volumetric images of a large number of targets are
time-consuming and challenging. In (Melnikova, A., & Matula, P., 2025), we
presented the first publicly available full 3D time-lapse segmentation
annotations of migrating cells with complex dynamic shapes. Concretely, three
distinct humans annotated two sequences of MDA231 human breast carcinoma cells
(Fluo-C3DL-MDA231) from the Cell Tracking Challenge (CTC).
  This paper aims to provide a comprehensive description of the dataset and
accompanying experiments that were not included in (Melnikova, A., & Matula,
P., 2025) due to limitations in publication space. Namely, we show that the
created annotations are consistent with the previously published tracking
markers provided by the CTC organizers and the segmentation accuracy measured
based on the 2D gold truth of CTC is within the inter-annotator variability
margins. We compared the created 3D annotations with automatically created
silver truth provided by CTC. We have found the proposed annotations better
represent the complexity of the input images. The presented annotations can be
used for testing and training cell segmentation, or analyzing 3D shapes of
highly dynamic objects.

Conclusion: 该模型在大规模地球观测任务和实际应用中具有有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Clouds remain a critical challenge in optical satellite imagery, hindering
reliable analysis for environmental monitoring, land cover mapping, and climate
research. To overcome this, we propose MSCloudCAM, a Cross-Attention with
Multi-Scale Context Network tailored for multispectral and multi-sensor cloud
segmentation. Our framework exploits the spectral richness of Sentinel-2
(CloudSEN12) and Landsat-8 (L8Biome) data to classify four semantic categories:
clear sky, thin cloud, thick cloud, and cloud shadow. MSCloudCAM combines a
Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical feature extraction with multi-scale
context modules ASPP and PSP for enhanced scale-aware learning. A
Cross-Attention block enables effective multisensor and multispectral feature
fusion, while the integration of an Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB)
and a Spatial Attention Module adaptively refine feature representations.
Comprehensive experiments on CloudSEN12 and L8Biome demonstrate that MSCloudCAM
delivers state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, surpassing leading baseline
architectures while maintaining competitive parameter efficiency and FLOPs.
These results underscore the model's effectiveness and practicality, making it
well-suited for large-scale Earth observation tasks and real-world
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个针对胸部X光诊断任务的偏见检测和缓解框架，通过将CNN最后一层替换为XGBoost分类器来改善不同人口亚组的公平性，同时保持或提高整体预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在提高胸部X光诊断准确性的同时，可能在不同人口群体间存在性能差异，从而加剧医疗保健不平等问题。

Method: 扩展CNN-XGBoost管道支持多标签分类，将CNN最后一层替换为XGBoost分类器，并在DenseNet-121和ResNet-50等不同骨干网络上验证方法的通用性。

Result: 该方法在保持或提高整体预测性能的同时，显著改善了亚组公平性，且计算成本远低于传统偏见缓解技术。结合主动学习能最大程度减少所有人口亚组的偏见。

Conclusion: 该方法为临床放射学中公平深度学习部署提供了实用有效的路径，具有模型无关设计和计算效率高的优势。

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown promise in improving diagnostic accuracy from
chest X-rays, but they also risk perpetuating healthcare disparities when
performance varies across demographic groups. In this work, we present a
comprehensive bias detection and mitigation framework targeting sex, age, and
race-based disparities when performing diagnostic tasks with chest X-rays. We
extend a recent CNN-XGBoost pipeline to support multi-label classification and
evaluate its performance across four medical conditions. We show that replacing
the final layer of CNN with an eXtreme Gradient Boosting classifier improves
the fairness of the subgroup while maintaining or improving the overall
predictive performance. To validate its generalizability, we apply the method
to different backbones, namely DenseNet-121 and ResNet-50, and achieve
similarly strong performance and fairness outcomes, confirming its
model-agnostic design. We further compare this lightweight adapter training
method with traditional full-model training bias mitigation techniques,
including adversarial training, reweighting, data augmentation, and active
learning, and find that our approach offers competitive or superior bias
reduction at a fraction of the computational cost. Finally, we show that
combining eXtreme Gradient Boosting retraining with active learning yields the
largest reduction in bias across all demographic subgroups, both in and out of
distribution on the CheXpert and MIMIC datasets, establishing a practical and
effective path toward equitable deep learning deployment in clinical radiology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于transformer的3D人体网格恢复模型计算成本高、复杂度大，主要由于深层transformer架构和冗余令牌。

Method: 提出ECLM选择性合并对MPJPE影响最小的transformer层，Mask-ToMe合并对预测贡献小的背景令牌，并使用扩散解码器结合时间上下文和姿态先验来补偿合并带来的性能损失。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法实现了高达2.3倍的加速，同时性能相比基线略有提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了3D人体网格恢复模型的计算效率问题，在显著加速的同时保持了甚至略微提升了性能。

Abstract: Recent transformer-based models for 3D Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) have
achieved strong performance but often suffer from high computational cost and
complexity due to deep transformer architectures and redundant tokens. In this
paper, we introduce two HMR-specific merging strategies: Error-Constrained
Layer Merging (ECLM) and Mask-guided Token Merging (Mask-ToMe). ECLM
selectively merges transformer layers that have minimal impact on the Mean Per
Joint Position Error (MPJPE), while Mask-ToMe focuses on merging background
tokens that contribute little to the final prediction. To further address the
potential performance drop caused by merging, we propose a diffusion-based
decoder that incorporates temporal context and leverages pose priors learned
from large-scale motion capture datasets. Experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves up to 2.3x speed-up while
slightly improving performance over the baseline.

Abstract: Real-world point cloud datasets have made significant contributions to the
development of LiDAR-based perception technologies, such as object segmentation
for autonomous driving. However, due to the limited number of instances in some
rare classes, the long-tail problem remains a major challenge in existing
datasets. To address this issue, we introduce a novel, synthetic point cloud
dataset named RareBoost3D, which complements existing real-world datasets by
providing significantly more instances for object classes that are rare in
real-world datasets. To effectively leverage both synthetic and real-world
data, we further propose a cross-domain semantic alignment method named CSC
loss that aligns feature representations of the same class across different
domains. Experimental results demonstrate that this alignment significantly
enhances the performance of LiDAR point cloud segmentation models over
real-world data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EarthWhere是一个全面的视觉语言模型图像地理定位基准，包含810张全球分布图像，评估视觉识别、逐步推理和证据使用能力。基准显示当前最佳模型准确率为56.32%，存在区域偏见和视觉线索有限时的性能挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型发展迅速，但其在开放世界条件下进行图像地理定位的能力尚未得到全面评估，而这是一个在现实生活中具有挑战性和需求的任务。

Method: 构建EarthWhere基准，包含两个互补的地理定位尺度：WhereCountry（500个选择题，国家级别）和WhereStreet（310个细粒度街道级别任务，需要多步推理和可选网络搜索）。采用最终预测指标和中间推理链评分方法，包括人类验证的关键视觉线索和Shapley重新加权的思维评分。

Result: 评估了13个最先进的视觉语言模型，Gemini-2.5-Pro达到最佳平均准确率56.32%，最强开源模型GLM-4.5V达到34.71%。发现网络搜索和推理在视觉线索有限时不能保证性能提升，模型存在区域偏见，某些区域得分比其他区域高42.7%。

Conclusion: 这些发现不仅突显了模型的潜力，也揭示了在减轻偏见和实现鲁棒细粒度定位方面的持续挑战。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced rapidly, yet their capacity for
image-grounded geolocation in open-world conditions, a task that is challenging
and of demand in real life, has not been comprehensively evaluated. We present
EarthWhere, a comprehensive benchmark for VLM image geolocation that evaluates
visual recognition, step-by-step reasoning, and evidence use. EarthWhere
comprises 810 globally distributed images across two complementary geolocation
scales: WhereCountry (i.e., 500 multiple-choice question-answering, with
country-level answer and panoramas) and WhereStreet (i.e., 310 fine-grained
street-level identification tasks requiring multi-step reasoning with optional
web search). For evaluation, we adopt the final-prediction metrics: location
accuracies within k km (Acc@k) for coordinates and hierarchical path scores for
textual localization. Beyond this, we propose to explicitly score intermediate
reasoning chains using human-verified key visual clues and a Shapley-reweighted
thinking score that attributes credit to each clue's marginal contribution. We
benchmark 13 state-of-the-art VLMs with web searching tools on our EarthWhere
and report different types of final answer accuracies as well as the calibrated
model thinking scores. Overall, Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the best average
accuracy at 56.32%, while the strongest open-weight model, GLM-4.5V, reaches
34.71%. We reveal that web search and reasoning do not guarantee improved
performance when visual clues are limited, and models exhibit regional biases,
achieving up to 42.7% higher scores in certain areas than others. These
findings highlight not only the promise but also the persistent challenges of
models to mitigate bias and achieve robust, fine-grained localization. We
open-source our benchmark at https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/EarthWhere.

TL;DR: ToMCLIP是一个拓扑感知的多语言CLIP框架，通过拓扑保持约束来对齐嵌入空间，解决了多语言视觉语言模型中跨模态对齐偏向英语的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对比视觉语言模型在跨模态对齐上偏向英语，多语言扩展方法虽然缓解了这一问题，但只关注实例级对齐而忽略了共享嵌入空间的全局几何结构。

Method: 提出ToMCLIP框架，应用持久同调定义拓扑对齐损失，使用图稀疏化策略近似持久图，并提供了理论误差界限。

Result: 实验验证了该方法能增强多语言表示的结构一致性，在CIFAR-100上获得更高的零样本准确率，在xFlickr&CO上实现更强的多语言检索性能。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于视觉语言模型，还为表示学习提供了一种通用的拓扑对齐方法。

Abstract: Contrastive Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot
capabilities. However, their cross-modal alignment remains biased toward
English due to limited multilingual multimodal data. Recent multilingual
extensions have alleviated this gap but enforce instance-level alignment while
neglecting the global geometry of the shared embedding space. We address this
problem by introducing ToMCLIP (Topological Alignment for Multilingual CLIP), a
topology-aware framework aligning embedding spaces with topology-preserving
constraints. The proposed method applies persistent homology to define a
topological alignment loss and approximates persistence diagram with
theoretical error bounds using graph sparsification strategy. This work
validates the proposed approach, showing enhanced structural coherence of
multilingual representations, higher zero-shot accuracy on the CIFAR-100, and
stronger multilingual retrieval performance on the xFlickr&CO. Beyond VLMs, the
proposed approach provides a general method for incorporating topological

### [131] [SceneTextStylizer: A Training-Free Scene Text Style Transfer Framework with Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10910)
*Honghui Yuan,Keiji Yanai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SceneTextStylizer，一种无需训练的基于扩散模型的框架，用于场景图像中文本的灵活高保真风格迁移，支持提示引导的文本区域风格转换，同时保持文本可读性和风格一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有场景文本编辑方法通常局限于内容替换和简单风格，缺乏自由风格迁移能力，无法实现灵活和局部化的文本风格编辑。

Method: 设计特征注入模块利用扩散模型反演和自注意力有效迁移风格特征；引入区域控制机制通过距离变化掩码实现精确空间控制；基于傅里叶变换的风格增强模块增强风格丰富度。

Result: 在场景文本风格转换方面取得卓越性能，在视觉保真度和文本保持方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了场景文本灵活局部化风格编辑的挑战，实现了高质量的文本风格迁移。

Abstract: With the rapid development of diffusion models, style transfer has made
remarkable progress. However, flexible and localized style editing for scene
text remains an unsolved challenge. Although existing scene text editing
methods have achieved text region editing, they are typically limited to
content replacement and simple styles, which lack the ability of free-style
transfer. In this paper, we introduce SceneTextStylizer, a novel training-free
diffusion-based framework for flexible and high-fidelity style transfer of text
in scene images. Unlike prior approaches that either perform global style
transfer or focus solely on textual content modification, our method enables
prompt-guided style transformation specifically for text regions, while
preserving both text readability and stylistic consistency. To achieve this, we
design a feature injection module that leverages diffusion model inversion and
self-attention to transfer style features effectively. Additionally, a region
control mechanism is introduced by applying a distance-based changing mask at
each denoising step, enabling precise spatial control. To further enhance
visual quality, we incorporate a style enhancement module based on the Fourier
transform to reinforce stylistic richness. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves superior performance in scene text style
transformation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual
fidelity and text preservation.

Abstract: The exponential growth of the global makeup market has paralleled
advancements in virtual makeup simulation technology. Despite the progress led
by GANs, their application still encounters significant challenges, including
training instability and limited customization capabilities. Addressing these
challenges, we introduce DreamMakup - a novel training-free Diffusion model
based Makeup Customization method, leveraging the inherent advantages of
diffusion models for superior controllability and precise real-image editing.

*Chunyu Xie,Bin Wang,Fanjing Kong,Jincheng Li,Dawei Liang,Ji Ao,Dawei Leng,Yuhui Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FG-CLIP 2是一个双语视觉语言模型，专注于提升英语和中文的细粒度对齐能力，通过区域-文本匹配、长文本建模和多判别目标等方法，在29个数据集上实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模型在细粒度视觉语言理解方面存在局限，特别是在非英语环境中。CLIP等模型在全局对齐上表现良好，但在对象属性、空间关系和语言表达的细粒度细节捕捉上不足，且双语理解支持有限。

Method: 利用丰富的细粒度监督（包括区域-文本匹配和长文本建模）以及多判别目标，引入文本模态内对比损失（TIC）来更好区分语义相似的描述，并在大规模英语和中文数据上进行训练。

Result: 在29个数据集和8个任务上的广泛实验表明，FG-CLIP 2超越了现有方法，在两种语言中都实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FG-CLIP 2通过精心设计的训练策略和新的评估基准，显著提升了双语细粒度对齐能力，为未来双语细粒度对齐研究提供了模型、代码和基准。

Abstract: Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires precise alignment between
visual content and linguistic descriptions, a capability that remains limited
in current models, particularly in non-English settings. While models like CLIP
perform well on global alignment, they often struggle to capture fine-grained
details in object attributes, spatial relations, and linguistic expressions,
with limited support for bilingual comprehension. To address these challenges,
we introduce FG-CLIP 2, a bilingual vision-language model designed to advance
fine-grained alignment for both English and Chinese. Our approach leverages
rich fine-grained supervision, including region-text matching and long-caption
modeling, alongside multiple discriminative objectives. We further introduce
the Textual Intra-modal Contrastive (TIC) loss to better distinguish
semantically similar captions. Trained on a carefully curated mixture of
large-scale English and Chinese data, FG-CLIP 2 achieves powerful bilingual
performance. To enable rigorous evaluation, we present a new benchmark for
Chinese multimodal understanding, featuring long-caption retrieval and bounding
box classification. Extensive experiments on 29 datasets across 8 tasks show
that FG-CLIP 2 outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results
in both languages. We release the model, code, and benchmark to facilitate
future research on bilingual fine-grained alignment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DKPMV是一种仅使用多视角RGB图像进行6D姿态估计的管道，通过密集关键点融合和三阶段渐进式姿态优化策略，在纹理缺失物体上取得了优于现有RGB方法和多数RGB-D方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决纹理缺失物体6D姿态估计中深度信息频繁丢失的问题，当前多视角方法要么依赖深度数据，要么未能充分利用多视角几何线索，限制了性能表现。

Method: 提出DKPMV管道，仅使用多视角RGB图像输入，实现密集关键点级融合；采用三阶段渐进式姿态优化策略，利用密集多视角关键点几何信息；通过注意力聚合和对称感知训练增强关键点网络，提高预测精度并解决对称物体的模糊性问题。

Result: 在ROBI数据集上的广泛实验表明，DKPMV优于最先进的多视角RGB方法，并且在大多数情况下甚至超越了RGB-D方法。

Conclusion: DKPMV证明了仅使用RGB图像就能实现高质量的6D姿态估计，为工业机器人应用提供了有效的解决方案，代码即将发布。

Abstract: 6D pose estimation of textureless objects is valuable for industrial robotic
applications, yet remains challenging due to the frequent loss of depth
information. Current multi-view methods either rely on depth data or
insufficiently exploit multi-view geometric cues, limiting their performance.
In this paper, we propose DKPMV, a pipeline that achieves dense keypoint-level
fusion using only multi-view RGB images as input. We design a three-stage
progressive pose optimization strategy that leverages dense multi-view keypoint
geometry information. To enable effective dense keypoint fusion, we enhance the
keypoint network with attentional aggregation and symmetry-aware training,
improving prediction accuracy and resolving ambiguities on symmetric objects.
Extensive experiments on the ROBI dataset demonstrate that DKPMV outperforms
state-of-the-art multi-view RGB approaches and even surpasses the RGB-D methods
in the majority of cases. The code will be available soon.

### [135] [Towards Distribution-Shift Uncertainty Estimation for Inverse Problems with Generative Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10947)
*Namhoon Kim,Sara Fridovich-Keil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无需校准的实例级不确定性指标，用于检测生成模型在逆问题重建中的分布偏移问题，基于重建稳定性来判断图像是否超出训练分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型作为数据驱动先验在逆问题中能减少测量次数，但存在对超出训练分布的图像产生幻觉特征的风险。现有不确定性量化方法需要校准数据集、提供启发式估计或无法专门检测分布偏移。

Method: 利用重建稳定性作为分布偏移的代理指标：对同分布图像的重建在随机测量变化下保持稳定，而对分布外图像的重建则表现出更大不稳定性。该方法无需训练分布知识，也不产生重新训练成本。

Result: 在MNIST数字的断层重建实验中，仅使用数字"0"训练的模型在所有十个数字上测试，分布外数字的重建显示出更高的变异性和重建误差，验证了该指标的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种轻量级防护策略，将生成先验与不确定性指标结合，可在同分布情况下实现激进的测量减少，同时在先验应用于分布外时自动发出警告。

Abstract: Generative models have shown strong potential as data-driven priors for
solving inverse problems such as reconstructing medical images from
undersampled measurements. While these priors improve reconstruction quality
with fewer measurements, they risk hallucinating features when test images lie
outside the training distribution. Existing uncertainty quantification methods
in this setting (i) require an in-distribution calibration dataset, which may
not be available, (ii) provide heuristic rather than statistical estimates, or
(iii) quantify uncertainty from model capacity or limited measurements rather
than distribution shift. We propose an instance-level, calibration-free
uncertainty indicator that is sensitive to distribution shift, requires no
knowledge of the training distribution, and incurs no retraining cost. Our key
hypothesis is that reconstructions of in-distribution images remain stable
under random measurement variations, while reconstructions of
out-of-distribution (OOD) images exhibit greater instability. We use this
stability as a proxy for detecting distribution shift. Our proposed OOD
indicator is efficiently computable for any computational imaging inverse
problem; we demonstrate it on tomographic reconstruction of MNIST digits, where
a learned proximal network trained only on digit "0" is evaluated on all ten
digits. Reconstructions of OOD digits show higher variability and
correspondingly higher reconstruction error, validating this indicator. These
results suggest a deployment strategy that pairs generative priors with
lightweight guardrails, enabling aggressive measurement reduction for
in-distribution cases while automatically warning when priors are applied out
of distribution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IUT-Plug是一个基于图像理解树(IUT)的模块，通过显式结构化推理增强现有交错视觉语言模型，解决逻辑、对象身份和风格的上下文漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在图像-文本生成中难以保持逻辑、对象身份和风格的一致性，限制了在复杂多模态场景中的泛化能力。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1)动态IUT-Plug提取模块将视觉场景解析为分层符号结构；2)协调的叙事流和图像合成机制确保跨模态一致性。

Result: 实验表明IUT-Plug不仅提高了现有基准测试的准确性，还有效缓解了三种关键形式的上下文漂移。

Conclusion: IUT-Plug通过结构化推理有效解决了视觉语言模型中的上下文漂移问题，提升了多模态场景下的性能。

Abstract: Existing vision language models (VLMs), including GPT-4 and DALL-E, often
struggle to preserve logic, object identity, and style in multimodal image-text
generation. This limitation significantly hinders the generalization capability
of VLMs in complex image-text input-output scenarios. To address this issue, we
propose IUT-Plug, a module grounded in an Image Understanding Tree (IUT), which
enhances existing interleaved VLMs through explicit structured reasoning,
thereby mitigating context drift in logic, entity identity, and style. The
proposed framework operates in two stages. (1) A dynamic IUT-Plug extraction
module parses visual scenes into hierarchical symbolic structures. (2) A
coordinated narrative-flow and image synthesis mechanism ensures cross-modal
consistency. To evaluate our approach, we construct a novel benchmark based on
3,000 real human-generated question-answer pairs over fine-tuned large models,
introducing a dynamic evaluation protocol for quantifying context drift in
interleaved VLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that IUT-Plug not only
improves accuracy on established benchmarks but also effectively alleviates the
three critical forms of context drift across diverse multimodal question
answering (QA) scenarios.

TL;DR: Chart-RVR是一个通过可验证奖励和组相对策略优化来微调大型视觉语言模型的框架，旨在提高图表推理的鲁棒性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型视觉语言模型在分布外数据上表现不佳，且在生成思维链推理时性能进一步下降，限制了可解释性。

Method: 结合组相对策略优化和三个自动可验证奖励：正确图表类型分类、忠实图表表格重建和过程一致性。

Result: 在3B参数模型上，Chart-RVR在分布内和分布外数据集上均优于标准监督微调，在六个图表推理基准测试中达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: Chart-RVR通过可验证奖励和GRPO训练出更可靠、可解释的图表推理模型，提高了信任度和可靠性。

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have reached
state-of-the-art on many visual reasoning tasks, including chart reasoning, yet
they still falter on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and degrade further when
asked to produce their chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, limiting
explainability. We present Chart-RVR, a general framework that fine-tunes LVLMs
to be more robust and explainable for chart reasoning by coupling Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with automatically verifiable rewards. Our
framework comprises of three rewards that maximize: (i) correct chart-type
classification, (ii) faithful chart table reconstruction, and (iii) process
conformity. Applied to 3-billion-parameter LVLMs, Chart-RVR consistently
outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution datasets, closing the OOD performance gap while improving
rationale fidelity. The resulting models, the Chart-RVR-3B series, achieve
state-of-the-art results on six chart-reasoning benchmarks spanning in-domain
and OOD settings, surpassing all existing models of comparable size. Beyond
accuracy, Chart-RVR yields more interpretable CoT rationales, strengthening
trust and reliability - showcasing the power of verifiable rewards with GRPO
for training reliable, interpretable chart-reasoning models.

TL;DR: 提出了两种多模态混合方法：MM在聚合特征层面应用Mixup策略缓解过拟合，B-MM进一步根据模态贡献动态调整混合比例，有效提升了多模态模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态模型容易过拟合强模态，导致弱模态贡献被抑制，影响模型性能。

Method: MM在多模态聚合特征层面应用Mixup生成虚拟特征-标签对；B-MM在MM基础上根据模态对学习目标的相对贡献动态调整各模态的混合比例。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，所提方法能有效提升泛化能力和多模态鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过多模态混合策略，特别是动态调整混合比例的B-MM方法，能够有效缓解模态不平衡问题，提升多模态模型的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal video understanding plays a crucial role in tasks such as action
recognition and emotion classification by combining information from different
modalities. However, multimodal models are prone to overfitting strong
modalities, which can dominate learning and suppress the contributions of
weaker ones. To address this challenge, we first propose Multimodal Mixup (MM),
which applies the Mixup strategy at the aggregated multimodal feature level to
mitigate overfitting by generating virtual feature-label pairs. While MM
effectively improves generalization, it treats all modalities uniformly and
does not account for modality imbalance during training. Building on MM, we
further introduce Balanced Multimodal Mixup (B-MM), which dynamically adjusts
the mixing ratios for each modality based on their relative contributions to
the learning objective. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of our methods in improving generalization and multimodal
robustness.

Abstract: With the recent emergence of revolutionary autonomous agentic systems,
research community is witnessing a significant shift from traditional static,
passive, and domain-specific AI agents toward more dynamic, proactive, and
generalizable agentic AI. Motivated by the growing interest in agentic AI and
its potential trajectory toward AGI, we present a comprehensive survey on
Agentic Multimodal Large Language Models (Agentic MLLMs). In this survey, we
explore the emerging paradigm of agentic MLLMs, delineating their conceptual
foundations and distinguishing characteristics from conventional MLLM-based
agents. We establish a conceptual framework that organizes agentic MLLMs along
three fundamental dimensions: (i) Agentic internal intelligence functions as
the system's commander, enabling accurate long-horizon planning through
reasoning, reflection, and memory; (ii) Agentic external tool invocation,
whereby models proactively use various external tools to extend their
problem-solving capabilities beyond their intrinsic knowledge; and (iii)
Agentic environment interaction further situates models within virtual or
physical environments, allowing them to take actions, adapt strategies, and
sustain goal-directed behavior in dynamic real-world scenarios. To further
accelerate research in this area for the community, we compile open-source
training frameworks, training and evaluation datasets for developing agentic
MLLMs. Finally, we review the downstream applications of agentic MLLMs and
outline future research directions for this rapidly evolving field. To
continuously track developments in this rapidly evolving field, we will also
actively update a public repository at
https://github.com/HJYao00/Awesome-Agentic-MLLMs.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian inpainting, a critical technique for numerous applications in
virtual reality and multimedia, has made significant progress with pretrained
diffusion models. However, ensuring multi-view consistency, an essential
requirement for high-quality inpainting, remains a key challenge. In this work,
we present PAInpainter, a novel approach designed to advance 3D Gaussian
inpainting by leveraging perspective-aware content propagation and consistency
verification across multi-view inpainted images. Our method iteratively refines
inpainting and optimizes the 3D Gaussian representation with multiple views
adaptively sampled from a perspective graph. By propagating inpainted images as
prior information and verifying consistency across neighboring views,
PAInpainter substantially enhances global consistency and texture fidelity in
restored 3D scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
PAInpainter over existing methods. Our approach achieves superior 3D inpainting
quality, with PSNR scores of 26.03 dB and 29.51 dB on the SPIn-NeRF and
NeRFiller datasets, respectively, highlighting its effectiveness and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代扩散模型在多实例图像生成中存在两个主要限制：难以精确控制对象布局，以及无法保持多个不同主体的身份一致性。

Method: 提出ContextGen框架，包含两个关键技术：上下文布局锚定(CLA)机制将复合布局图像整合到生成上下文中，确保对象精确定位；身份一致性注意力(ICA)机制利用上下文参考图像保证多个实例的身份一致性。

Result: ContextGen在控制精度、身份保真度和整体视觉质量方面均优于现有方法，达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: ContextGen通过创新的布局锚定和身份一致性机制，有效解决了多实例图像生成中的关键挑战，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-instance image generation (MIG) remains a significant challenge for
modern diffusion models due to key limitations in achieving precise control
over object layout and preserving the identity of multiple distinct subjects.
To address these limitations, we introduce ContextGen, a novel Diffusion
Transformer framework for multi-instance generation that is guided by both
layout and reference images. Our approach integrates two key technical
contributions: a Contextual Layout Anchoring (CLA) mechanism that incorporates
the composite layout image into the generation context to robustly anchor the
objects in their desired positions, and Identity Consistency Attention (ICA),
an innovative attention mechanism that leverages contextual reference images to
ensure the identity consistency of multiple instances. Recognizing the lack of
large-scale, hierarchically-structured datasets for this task, we introduce
IMIG-100K, the first dataset with detailed layout and identity annotations.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ContextGen sets a new state-of-the-art,
outperforming existing methods in control precision, identity fidelity, and
overall visual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在复杂低对比度背景下难以聚焦前景区域，特别是当恶性肿瘤与正常器官相似时，上下文区分变得困难。

Method: 1) 前景感知模块放大背景与整个体积空间的区分；2) 基于小波变换的特征级频率增强模块提取高频特征；3) 边缘约束模块保持分割边界的几何连续性。

Result: 在多个医学数据集上的广泛实验显示，所有指标均表现优越，特别是在复杂条件下的鲁棒性和精细结构识别方面。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了低对比度图像的分割效果，为更复杂多样的医学成像场景应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tumors and adjacent normal tissues in medical images
is essential for surgical planning and tumor staging. Although foundation
models generally perform well in segmentation tasks, they often struggle to
focus on foreground areas in complex, low-contrast backgrounds, where some
malignant tumors closely resemble normal organs, complicating contextual
differentiation. To address these challenges, we propose the Foreground-Aware
Spectrum Segmentation (FASS) framework. First, we introduce a foreground-aware
module to amplify the distinction between background and the entire volume
space, allowing the model to concentrate more effectively on target areas.
Next, a feature-level frequency enhancement module, based on wavelet transform,
extracts discriminative high-frequency features to enhance boundary recognition
and detail perception. Eventually, we introduce an edge constraint module to
preserve geometric continuity in segmentation boundaries. Extensive experiments
on multiple medical datasets demonstrate superior performance across all
metrics, validating the effectiveness of our framework, particularly in
robustness under complex conditions and fine structure recognition. Our
framework significantly enhances segmentation of low-contrast images, paving
the way for applications in more diverse and complex medical imaging scenarios.

Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型在组合推理方面存在持续弱点，现有方法要么资源密集，要么缺乏可解释的推理过程。

Method: 提出COCO-Tree方法，使用从大型语言模型学习得到的神经符号概念树来增强VLM输出，采用波束搜索启发式推理过程。

Conclusion: COCO-Tree有效提升了VLM的组合推理能力，同时提供了可解释的预测依据。

Abstract: Compositional reasoning remains a persistent weakness of modern vision
language models (VLMs): they often falter when a task hinges on understanding
how multiple objects, attributes, and relations interact within an image.
Multiple research works have attempted to improve compositionality performance
by creative tricks such as improving prompt structure, chain of thought
reasoning, etc. A more recent line of work attempts to impart additional
reasoning in VLMs using well-trained Large Language Models (LLMs), which are
far superior in linguistic understanding than VLMs to compensate for the
limited linguistic prowess of VLMs. However, these approaches are either
resource-intensive or do not provide an interpretable reasoning process. In
this paper, we present 'COCO-Tree' - a novel approach that augments VLM outputs
with carefully designed neurosymbolic concept trees learned from LLMs to
improve VLM's linguistic reasoning. COCO-Tree's beam search-inspired reasoning
process boosts compositionality performance and provides a rationale behind VLM
predictions. Empirical results on four compositionality benchmarks, Winoground,
EqBench, ColorSwap, and SugarCrepe, in seven different open-source VLMs with
varying sizes, demonstrate that COCO-Tree significantly improves compositional
generalization by 5-10% over baselines.

Motivation: 现有视频人体姿态估计方法通常使用单一建模结构（卷积或注意力），难以平衡全局动态上下文和局部运动细节的建模，且存在二次复杂度问题。Mamba模型在长距离上下文建模方面表现出色但仅限于1D序列数据。

Method: 提出了全局时空Mamba进行6D选择性时空扫描和时空调制扫描合并来提取全局表示，以及基于窗口化时空扫描的局部精化Mamba来增强局部关键点运动的高频细节。

Conclusion: 该框架成功扩展了Mamba模型，分别学习全局和局部的高分辨率时空表示，在视频人体姿态估计任务中取得了优越性能。

Abstract: Modeling high-resolution spatiotemporal representations, including both
global dynamic contexts (e.g., holistic human motion tendencies) and local
motion details (e.g., high-frequency changes of keypoints), is essential for
video-based human pose estimation (VHPE). Current state-of-the-art methods
typically unify spatiotemporal learning within a single type of modeling
structure (convolution or attention-based blocks), which inherently have
difficulties in balancing global and local dynamic modeling and may bias the
network to one of them, leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, existing
VHPE models suffer from quadratic complexity when capturing global
dependencies, limiting their applicability especially for high-resolution
sequences. Recently, the state space models (known as Mamba) have demonstrated
significant potential in modeling long-range contexts with linear complexity;
however, they are restricted to 1D sequential data. In this paper, we present a
novel framework that extends Mamba from two aspects to separately learn global
and local high-resolution spatiotemporal representations for VHPE.
Specifically, we first propose a Global Spatiotemporal Mamba, which performs 6D
selective space-time scan and spatial- and temporal-modulated scan merging to
efficiently extract global representations from high-resolution sequences. We
further introduce a windowed space-time scan-based Local Refinement Mamba to
enhance the high-frequency details of localized keypoint motions. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model
outperforms state-of-the-art VHPE approaches while achieving better
computational trade-offs.

TL;DR: 提出GeoVLMath模型，通过文本描述辅助线构造而非图像编辑，结合强化学习提升几何问题求解能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大视觉语言模型在解决复杂几何问题时难以精确绘制辅助线，图像编辑模型缺乏几何精度

Method: 使用强化学习框架，通过跨模态奖励评估辅助线描述与真实辅助线图的对齐程度，基于GRPO进行训练

Result: 在3B和7B规模上，GeoVLMath在辅助线推理基准测试中表现优于开源和专有LVLMs

Conclusion: 文本描述辅助线构造结合强化学习是解决几何问题的有效方法，GeoVLMath模型在几何推理任务中具有竞争力

Abstract: Auxiliary lines are essential for solving complex geometric problems but
remain challenging for large vision-language models (LVLMs). Rather than
editing diagrams to draw auxiliary lines, which current image editing models
struggle to render with geometric precision, we generate textual descriptions
of auxiliary-line constructions to better align with the representational
strengths of LVLMs. To bridge the gap between textual descriptions and spatial
structure, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that enhances
diagram-text alignment. At the core of our approach is a cross-modal reward
that evaluates how well the generated auxiliary-line description for an
original diagram matches a ground-truth auxiliary-line diagram. Built on this
reward, we present GeoVLMath, an open-source LVLM tailored to auxiliary-line
reasoning in solid geometry. This fine-grained signal drives a GRPO-based RL
stage, yielding precise diagram-text alignment. To support training, we develop
a scalable data creation pipeline and construct AuxSolidMath, a dataset of
3,018 real-exam geometry problems with paired diagrams and aligned textual
fields. At the 3B and 7B scales, GeoVLMath achieves competitive and often
superior performance compared with strong open-source and proprietary LVLMs on
auxiliary-line reasoning benchmarks.

Motivation: 当前社区缺乏严格的推理中心基准来系统评估多模态模型在理解与生成之间的一致性及其在复杂视觉任务中的泛化潜力。

Method: 设计了GIR-Bench基准，包含三个子集：理解-生成一致性评估、推理中心文本到图像生成评估、多步推理编辑评估，并为每个任务设计了特定的评估流程。

Result: 广泛消融实验表明，虽然统一模型在推理驱动的视觉任务中表现更好，但理解与生成之间仍存在持续性差距。

Conclusion: GIR-Bench为系统评估多模态模型提供了重要基准，揭示了当前模型在理解与生成对齐方面的局限性，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models integrate the reasoning capacity of large language
models with both image understanding and generation, showing great promise for
advanced multimodal intelligence. However, the community still lacks a rigorous
reasoning-centric benchmark to systematically evaluate the alignment between
understanding and generation, and their generalization potential in complex
visual tasks. To this end, we introduce \textbf{GIR-Bench}, a comprehensive
benchmark that evaluates unified models across three complementary
perspectives. Firstly, we investigate understanding-generation consistency
(GIR-Bench-UGC), asking whether models can consistently leverage the same
knowledge in both understanding and generation tasks. Secondly, we investigate
whether models can perform reasoning-centric text-to-image generation that
requires applying logical constraints and implicit knowledge to generate
faithful visual content (GIR-Bench-T2I). Thirdly, we evaluate whether models
can handle multi-step reasoning in editing (GIR-Bench-Edit). For each subset,
we carefully design different task-specific evaluation pipelines tailored for
each task. This enables fine-grained and interpretable evaluation while
mitigating biases from the prevalent MLLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. Extensive
ablations over various unified models and generation-only systems have shown
that: Although unified models are more capable of reasoning-driven visual
tasks, they still exhibit a persistent gap between understanding and
generation. The data and code for GIR-Bench are available at

Abstract: While significant research has focused on developing embodied reasoning
capabilities using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or integrating advanced VLMs
into Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end robot control, few
studies directly address the critical gap between upstream VLM-based reasoning
and downstream VLA policy learning. In this work, we take an initial step
toward bridging embodied reasoning with VLA policy learning by introducing
Vlaser - a Vision-Language-Action Model with synergistic embodied reasoning
capability, which is a foundational vision-language model designed to integrate
high-level reasoning with low-level control for embodied agents. Built upon the
high-quality Vlaser-6M dataset, Vlaser achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a range of embodied reasoning benchmarks - including spatial reasoning,
embodied grounding, embodied QA, and task planning. Furthermore, we
systematically examine how different VLM initializations affect supervised VLA
fine-tuning, offering novel insights into mitigating the domain shift between
internet-scale pre-training data and embodied-specific policy learning data.
Based on these insights, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the
WidowX benchmark and competitive performance on the Google Robot benchmark.

Motivation: 基础模型在零样本异常分割任务中展现出强大的泛化能力，但如何正确引导这些模型解决下游任务仍是一个挑战。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1) Co-Feature Point Prompt Generation (PPG)模块，协作利用CLIP和SAM生成正负点提示，引导SAM专注于分割异常区域而非整个对象；2) Cascaded Prompts for SAM (CPS)模块，使用混合提示与SAM的轻量级解码器级联，实现异常区域的精确分割。

Conclusion: 该框架通过有效结合CLIP和SAM的优势，成功解决了零样本异常分割任务，在工业异常检测中表现出色。

Abstract: Recently, the powerful generalization ability exhibited by foundation models
has brought forth new solutions for zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks.
However, guiding these foundation models correctly to address downstream tasks
remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel two-stage framework, for
zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks in industrial anomaly detection. This
framework excellently leverages the powerful anomaly localization capability of
CLIP and the boundary perception ability of SAM.(1) To mitigate SAM's
inclination towards object segmentation, we propose the Co-Feature Point Prompt
Generation (PPG) module. This module collaboratively utilizes CLIP and SAM to
generate positive and negative point prompts, guiding SAM to focus on
segmenting anomalous regions rather than the entire object. (2) To further
optimize SAM's segmentation results and mitigate rough boundaries and isolated
noise, we introduce the Cascaded Prompts for SAM (CPS) module. This module
employs hybrid prompts cascaded with a lightweight decoder of SAM, achieving
precise segmentation of anomalous regions. Across multiple datasets, consistent
experimental validation demonstrates that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art zero-shot anomaly segmentation results. Particularly
noteworthy is our performance on the Visa dataset, where we outperform the
state-of-the-art methods by 10.3\% and 7.7\% in terms of {$F_1$-max} and AP
metrics, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 喉癌影像研究缺乏标准化数据集来支持可重复的深度学习模型开发，这阻碍了AI在临床决策中的应用。

Method: 从TCIA六个数据集中收集1,029个CT扫描，使用弱监督参数搜索框架提取统一的1mm各向同性喉部感兴趣区域，并评估了3D CNN、ResNet18/50/101和DenseNet121等架构在两种分类任务上的性能。

Result: 3D CNN在早期vs晚期分类任务中表现最佳（AUC 0.881，F1-macro 0.821），ResNet18在T4 vs非T4分类中表现最好（AUC 0.892，F1-macro 0.646）。3D GradCAM分析显示非T4病例中模型更关注软骨周围区域，而T4预测中显示局部激活。

Conclusion: LaryngealCT通过开源数据、预训练模型和集成可解释性工具，为AI驱动的喉癌研究提供了可重复的基础，支持临床决策。

Abstract: Laryngeal cancer imaging research lacks standardised datasets to enable
reproducible deep learning (DL) model development. We present LaryngealCT, a
curated benchmark of 1,029 computed tomography (CT) scans aggregated from six
collections from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Uniform 1 mm isotropic
volumes of interest encompassing the larynx were extracted using a weakly
supervised parameter search framework validated by clinical experts. 3D DL
architectures (3D CNN, ResNet18,50,101, DenseNet121) were benchmarked on (i)
early (Tis,T1,T2) vs. advanced (T3,T4) and (ii) T4 vs. non-T4 classification
tasks. 3D CNN (AUC-0.881, F1-macro-0.821) and ResNet18 (AUC-0.892,
F1-macro-0.646) respectively outperformed the other models in the two tasks.
Model explainability assessed using 3D GradCAMs with thyroid cartilage overlays
revealed greater peri-cartilage attention in non-T4 cases and focal activations
in T4 predictions. Through open-source data, pretrained models, and integrated

Motivation: 现有的文本引导扩散模型在真实人脸编辑任务中难以保持身份和结构一致性，需要解决这一问题以实现更精确的人脸编辑。

Method: 将人脸表示分解为身份和属性特征，作为联合条件指导反演和反向扩散过程，实现身份和属性的独立控制。

Result: 方法支持仅使用文本提示的复杂多属性人脸编辑任务，无需区域特定输入，速度与DDIM反演相当，实验证明其实用性和有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的ID-属性解耦反演方法在保持身份一致性的同时实现了精确的面部属性编辑，为零样本人脸编辑提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-guided diffusion models have shown promise for
general image editing via inversion techniques, but often struggle to maintain
ID and structural consistency in real face editing tasks. To address this
limitation, we propose a zero-shot face editing method based on ID-Attribute
Decoupled Inversion. Specifically, we decompose the face representation into ID
and attribute features, using them as joint conditions to guide both the
inversion and the reverse diffusion processes. This allows independent control
over ID and attributes, ensuring strong ID preservation and structural
consistency while enabling precise facial attribute manipulation. Our method
supports a wide range of complex multi-attribute face editing tasks using only
text prompts, without requiring region-specific input, and operates at a speed
comparable to DDIM inversion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate its
practicality and effectiveness.

Motivation: 推动视频目标分割在现实复杂场景中的鲁棒性，超越精心设计的基准测试，提升长期一致性和泛化能力。

Method: 挑战赛包含三个赛道：经典VOS、参考VOS和新增的复杂VOS（MOSEv2）。MOSEv2增加了更困难的场景条件，如密集小目标、频繁消失重现、严重遮挡、恶劣天气等。

Result: 挑战赛采用标准J、F、J&F指标评估VOS和RVOS，MOSEv2采用J&F作为主要排名指标以更好评估不同尺度和消失情况下的目标。

Conclusion: 总结了数据集和协议，突出表现最佳的解决方案，提炼出LLM/MLLM组件和内存感知传播等新兴趋势，旨在为野外鲁棒、语言感知的视频分割指明未来方向。

Abstract: This report presents an overview of the 7th Large-scale Video Object
Segmentation (LSVOS) Challenge held in conjunction with ICCV 2025. Besides the
two traditional tracks of LSVOS that jointly target robustness in realistic
video scenarios: Classic VOS (VOS), and Referring VOS (RVOS), the 2025 edition
features a newly introduced track, Complex VOS (MOSEv2). Building upon prior
insights, MOSEv2 substantially increases difficulty, introducing more
challenging but realistic scenarios including denser small objects, frequent
disappear/reappear events, severe occlusions, adverse weather and lighting,
etc., pushing long-term consistency and generalization beyond curated
benchmarks. The challenge retains standard ${J}$, $F$, and ${J\&F}$ metrics for
VOS and RVOS, while MOSEv2 adopts ${J\&\dot{F}}$ as the primary ranking metric
to better evaluate objects across scales and disappearance cases. We summarize
datasets and protocols, highlight top-performing solutions, and distill
emerging trends, such as the growing role of LLM/MLLM components and
memory-aware propagation, aiming to chart future directions for resilient,
language-aware video segmentation in the wild.

Conclusion: FRANCK框架通过专门设计的组件有效适应源域预训练的DETR模型到目标域，具有增强的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) enables knowledge transfer from a source
domain to an unsupervised target domain for object detection without access to
source data. Most existing SFOD approaches are either confined to conventional
object detection (OD) models like Faster R-CNN or designed as general solutions
without tailored adaptations for novel OD architectures, especially Detection
Transformer (DETR). In this paper, we introduce Feature Reweighting ANd
Contrastive Learning NetworK (FRANCK), a novel SFOD framework specifically
designed to perform query-centric feature enhancement for DETRs. FRANCK
comprises four key components: (1) an Objectness Score-based Sample Reweighting
(OSSR) module that computes attention-based objectness scores on multi-scale
encoder feature maps, reweighting the detection loss to emphasize
less-recognized regions; (2) a Contrastive Learning with Matching-based Memory
Bank (CMMB) module that integrates multi-level features into memory banks,
enhancing class-wise contrastive learning; (3) an Uncertainty-weighted
Query-fused Feature Distillation (UQFD) module that improves feature
distillation through prediction quality reweighting and query feature fusion;
and (4) an improved self-training pipeline with a Dynamic Teacher Updating
Interval (DTUI) that optimizes pseudo-label quality. By leveraging these
components, FRANCK effectively adapts a source-pre-trained DETR model to a
target domain with enhanced robustness and generalization. Extensive
experiments on several widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its effectiveness and
compatibility with DETR-based SFOD models.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Computer-Aided Design(CAD) drawings in
engineering, architecture, and industrial design, the ability to accurately
interpret and analyze these drawings has become increasingly critical. Among
various subtasks, panoptic symbol spotting plays a vital role in enabling
downstream applications such as CAD automation and design retrieval. Existing
methods primarily focus on geometric primitives within the CAD drawings to
address this task, but they face following major problems: they usually
overlook the rich textual annotations present in CAD drawings and they lack
explicit modeling of relationships among primitives, resulting in
incomprehensive understanding of the holistic drawings. To fill this gap, we
propose a panoptic symbol spotting framework that incorporates textual
annotations. The framework constructs unified representations by jointly
modeling geometric and textual primitives. Then, using visual features extract
by pretrained CNN as the initial representations, a Transformer-based backbone
is employed, enhanced with a type-aware attention mechanism to explicitly model
the different types of spatial dependencies between various primitives.
Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms existing approaches on symbol spotting tasks involving
textual annotations, and exhibits superior robustness when applied to complex
CAD drawings.

Method: 提出双向建模方法：首先预测未来鸟瞰图表示来预判周围场景动态，然后利用这种前瞻性生成未来上下文感知的轨迹。包含两个关键组件：未来感知规划和迭代场景建模与车辆规划。

Result: 在NAVSIM和nuScenes基准测试上的广泛实验表明，SeerDrive显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 未来自动驾驶车辆轨迹与环境动态演化密切相关，双向建模方法能够显著提升轨迹规划性能。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving methods aim to directly map raw sensor inputs
to future driving actions such as planned trajectories, bypassing traditional
modular pipelines. While these approaches have shown promise, they often
operate under a one-shot paradigm that relies heavily on the current scene
context, potentially underestimating the importance of scene dynamics and their
temporal evolution. This limitation restricts the model's ability to make
informed and adaptive decisions in complex driving scenarios. We propose a new
perspective: the future trajectory of an autonomous vehicle is closely
intertwined with the evolving dynamics of its environment, and conversely, the
vehicle's own future states can influence how the surrounding scene unfolds.
Motivated by this bidirectional relationship, we introduce SeerDrive, a novel
end-to-end framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory
planning in a closed-loop manner. Our method first predicts future bird's-eye
view (BEV) representations to anticipate the dynamics of the surrounding scene,
then leverages this foresight to generate future-context-aware trajectories.
Two key components enable this: (1) future-aware planning, which injects
predicted BEV features into the trajectory planner, and (2) iterative scene
modeling and vehicle planning, which refines both future scene prediction and
trajectory generation through collaborative optimization. Extensive experiments
on the NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show that SeerDrive significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 监督扩散去噪为多模态防御提供了有效方案，有助于多模态大语言模型在现实应用中的可靠安全部署。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal
reasoning by integrating visual and textual modalities. However, their
multimodal nature also exposes them to adversarial threats, where attackers can
perturb either modality or both jointly to induce harmful, misleading, or
policy violating outputs. Existing defense strategies, such as adversarial
training and input purification, face notable limitations: adversarial training
typically improves robustness only against known attacks while incurring high
computational costs, whereas conventional purification approaches often suffer
from degraded image quality and insufficient generalization to complex
multimodal tasks.
  In this work, we focus on defending the visual modality, which frequently
serves as the primary entry point for adversarial manipulation. We propose a
supervised diffusion based denoising framework that leverages paired
adversarial clean image datasets to fine-tune diffusion models with
directional, task specific guidance. Unlike prior unsupervised purification
methods such as DiffPure, our approach achieves higher quality reconstructions
while significantly improving defense robustness in multimodal tasks.
Furthermore, we incorporate prompt optimization as a complementary defense
mechanism, enhancing resistance against diverse and unseen attack strategies.
  Extensive experiments on image captioning and visual question answering
demonstrate that our method not only substantially improves robustness but also
exhibits strong transferability to unknown adversarial attacks. These results
highlight the effectiveness of supervised diffusion based denoising for
multimodal defense, paving the way for more reliable and secure deployment of
MLLMs in real world applications.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) is a critical task in computer vision
that enables models to recognize unseen combinations of known attributes and
objects during inference, addressing the combinatorial challenge of requiring
training data for every possible composition. This is particularly challenging
because the visual appearance of primitives is highly contextual; for example,
``small'' cats appear visually distinct from ``older'' ones, and ``wet'' cars
differ significantly from ``wet'' cats. Effectively modeling this contextuality
and the inherent compositionality is crucial for robust compositional zero-shot
recognition. This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive
survey specifically focused on Compositional Zero-Shot Learning. We
systematically review the state-of-the-art CZSL methods, introducing a taxonomy
grounded in disentanglement, with four families of approaches: no explicit
disentanglement, textual disentanglement, visual disentanglement, and
cross-modal disentanglement. We provide a detailed comparative analysis of
these methods, highlighting their core advantages and limitations in different
problem settings, such as closed-world and open-world CZSL. Finally, we
identify the most significant open challenges and outline promising future
research directions. This survey aims to serve as a foundational resource to
guide and inspire further advancements in this fascinating and important field.

### [158] [video-SALMONN S: Streaming Audio-Visual LLMs Beyond Length Limits via Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11129)
*Guangzhi Sun,Yixuan Li,Xiaodong Wu,Yudong Yang,Wei Li,Zejun Ma,Chao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: video-SALMONN S是首个能在固定内存预算下处理3小时视频（1FPS，360p）的流式音频-视觉LLM，通过测试时训练内存模块和提示相关内存读取器实现长视频理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频理解LLM难以扩展处理长视频流，离线方法需要调整帧率，流式方法会丢失信息。需要一种能在固定内存下持续处理长视频的方法。

Method: 引入测试时训练(TTT)内存模块持续更新token表示以捕获长程依赖，使用提示相关内存读取器选择性检索相关内容，采用Hessian-free共轭梯度优化TTT模块。

Result: 在长视频基准测试(Video-MME, LVBench, VideoEvalPro)上，模型能处理10k帧、100万token的多小时视频，8B参数模型在Video-MME长分割上达到74.2%总体和67.8%的准确率，优于离线和流式基线。

Conclusion: video-SALMONN S证明了在固定内存预算下持续处理长视频的可行性，为未来AI代理的高帧率、高分辨率视频处理提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Continuous, high-frame-rate, high-resolution processing of long video streams
is critical for future AI agents, yet current video-understanding LLMs struggle
to scale. Offline, fixed-frame-number methods require the stream length to
adapt frame rates; streaming methods constrain memory by merging or discarding
tokens, losing information. We propose video-SALMONN S, a streaming
audio-visual LLM that, to our knowledge, is the first to process 3-hour videos
at 1 FPS and 360p resolution under a fixed memory budget. Our model introduces
(i) a test-time-training (TTT) memory module that continually updates token
representations to capture long-range dependencies by replacing token merging,
and (ii) a prompt-dependent memory reader that selectively retrieves
context-relevant content from fixed-size memory. The TTT module is optimised
with a Hessian-free conjugate-gradient procedure (TTT_HF) for efficient
adaptation. On long-video benchmarks (Video-MME, LVBench, VideoEvalPro),
video-SALMONN S sustains high-quality understanding on multi-hour videos with
10k frames and 1M tokens. Our 8B-parameter model achieves 74.2% overall and
67.8% on the Video-MME long split, outperforming both offline and streaming
baselines.

TL;DR: 提出一种从单张图像预测未来3D场景运动的方法，使用像素对齐的运动图表示和扩散模型来生成语义一致的3D运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从真实世界视频中学习语义和功能上有意义的3D运动先验，以实现从单张输入图像预测未来3D场景运动。

Method: 提出像素对齐的运动图表示，从5万多真实视频创建大规模MoMap数据库，并训练扩散模型来生成3D运动轨迹。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能生成合理且语义一致的3D场景运动，并提出了新的2D视频合成流程。

Conclusion: MoMap表示和扩散模型能够有效学习3D运动先验，为从单张图像预测场景运动提供了可行方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of learning semantically and functionally
meaningful 3D motion priors from real-world videos, in order to enable
prediction of future 3D scene motion from a single input image. We propose a
novel pixel-aligned Motion Map (MoMap) representation for 3D scene motion,
which can be generated from existing generative image models to facilitate
efficient and effective motion prediction. To learn meaningful distributions
over motion, we create a large-scale database of MoMaps from over 50,000 real
videos and train a diffusion model on these representations. Our motion
generation not only synthesizes trajectories in 3D but also suggests a new
pipeline for 2D video synthesis: first generate a MoMap, then warp an image
accordingly and complete the warped point-based renderings. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach generates plausible and semantically
consistent 3D scene motion.

*Chen Liu,Wenfang Yao,Kejing Yin,William K. Cheung,Jing Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiPro是一个处理纵向多模态医疗数据的框架，通过区域感知解耦和多时间尺度对齐，解决CXR序列冗余和与EHR数据时间不对齐的问题，在疾病进展识别和ICU预测任务上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纵向多模态数据（如EHR和连续CXR）在疾病进展建模中至关重要但未充分利用，主要面临两个挑战：连续CXR序列中的冗余（静态解剖区域主导临床有意义动态）以及稀疏、不规则成像与连续EHR数据之间的时间不对齐。

Method: 1. 在连续CXR中解耦静态（解剖）和动态（病理进展）特征，优先考虑疾病相关变化；2. 通过局部（成对间隔级）和全局（全序列）同步，分层对齐这些静态和动态CXR特征与异步EHR数据，以建模连贯的进展路径。

Result: 在MIMIC数据集上的广泛实验表明，DiPro能够有效提取时间临床动态，并在疾病进展识别和一般ICU预测任务上实现最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DiPro框架通过解决多模态医疗数据中的关键挑战，成功提升了疾病进展建模的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Longitudinal multimodal data, including electronic health records (EHR) and
sequential chest X-rays (CXRs), is critical for modeling disease progression,
yet remains underutilized due to two key challenges: (1) redundancy in
consecutive CXR sequences, where static anatomical regions dominate over
clinically-meaningful dynamics, and (2) temporal misalignment between sparse,
irregular imaging and continuous EHR data. We introduce $\texttt{DiPro}$, a
novel framework that addresses these challenges through region-aware
disentanglement and multi-timescale alignment. First, we disentangle static
(anatomy) and dynamic (pathology progression) features in sequential CXRs,
prioritizing disease-relevant changes. Second, we hierarchically align these
static and dynamic CXR features with asynchronous EHR data via local (pairwise
interval-level) and global (full-sequence) synchronization to model coherent
progression pathways. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC dataset demonstrate
that $\texttt{DiPro}$ could effectively extract temporal clinical dynamics and
achieve state-of-the-art performance on both disease progression identification
and general ICU prediction tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出G2L框架，通过知识蒸馏将千亿级病理基础模型的能力迁移到仅含15%参数的大规模模型上，使用少量目标癌症数据即可达到千亿级模型性能水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决千亿级病理基础模型在实际应用中计算成本过高的问题，寻求在保持高性能的同时降低计算负担的方法。

Method: 采用知识蒸馏技术，使用仅1000张目标癌症病理切片，将千亿级教师模型的能力迁移到大规模学生模型。

Result: 蒸馏后的大规模模型不仅超越了同规模的最先进模型，在某些基准测试中甚至超过了千亿级教师模型和更大规模模型，并表现出更高的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法是一种数据和参数高效的方式，可在不产生过高计算负担的情况下，为癌症特定应用实现千亿级性能水平。

Abstract: Recent studies in pathology foundation models have shown that scaling
training data, diversifying cancer types, and increasing model size
consistently improve their performance. However, giga-scale foundation models,
which are trained on hundreds of thousands of slides covering tens of cancer
types and contain billions of parameters, pose significant challenges for
practical use due to their tremendous computational costs in both development
and deployment. In this work, we present a novel strategy, named the G2L
framework, to increase the performance of large-scale foundation models, which
consist of only $15\%$ of the parameters of giga-scale models, to a comparable
performance level of giga-scale models in cancer-specific tasks. Our approach
applies knowledge distillation, transferring the capabilities of a giga-scale
model to a large-scale model, using just 1K pathology slides of a target cancer
(e.g., breast, prostate, etc.). The resulting distilled model not only
outperformed state-of-the-art models of the same size (i.e., large-scale)
across several benchmarks but also, interestingly, surpassed the giga-scale
teacher and huge-scale models in some benchmarks. In addition, the distilled
model exhibited a higher robustness index, indicating improved resilience to
image variations originating from multiple institutions. These findings suggest
that the proposed distillation approach for a large-scale model is a data- and
parameter-efficient way to achieve giga-scale-level performance for
cancer-specific applications without prohibitive computational burden.

TL;DR: SynTrans框架通过从大型多模态模型转移多样化知识来增强现成的少样本学习器，在四个少样本学习数据集上显著优于当前最先进方法。


<details>

Motivation: 传统少样本学习方法在利用小规模模型的语义知识时容易引入噪声和偏见，需要更有效地从大型多模态模型转移知识来解决数据稀缺问题。

Method: 使用CLIP作为强教师模型，少样本视觉编码器作为弱学生模型，通过无监督代理任务蒸馏语义对齐的视觉知识；包含训练自由的协同知识挖掘模块、视觉-语义桥接模块、视觉权重生成器和语义权重重构器。

Result: 在四个少样本学习数据集上的实验结果表明，即使搭配简单的少样本视觉编码器，SynTrans也能显著超越当前最先进方法。

Conclusion: SynTrans框架通过协同知识转移和双向知识转换，有效提升了少样本学习的性能，证明了从大型多模态模型转移多样化知识的有效性。

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses the challenge of classifying novel classes
with limited training samples. While some methods leverage semantic knowledge
from smaller-scale models to mitigate data scarcity, these approaches often
introduce noise and bias due to the data's inherent simplicity. In this paper,
we propose a novel framework, Synergistic Knowledge Transfer (SynTrans), which
effectively transfers diverse and complementary knowledge from large multimodal
models to empower the off-the-shelf few-shot learner. Specifically, SynTrans
employs CLIP as a robust teacher and uses a few-shot vision encoder as a weak
student, distilling semantic-aligned visual knowledge via an unsupervised proxy
task. Subsequently, a training-free synergistic knowledge mining module
facilitates collaboration among large multimodal models to extract high-quality
semantic knowledge. Building upon this, a visual-semantic bridging module
enables bi-directional knowledge transfer between visual and semantic spaces,
transforming explicit visual and implicit semantic knowledge into
category-specific classifier weights. Finally, SynTrans introduces a visual
weight generator and a semantic weight reconstructor to adaptively construct
optimal multimodal FSL classifiers. Experimental results on four FSL datasets
demonstrate that SynTrans, even when paired with a simple few-shot vision
encoder, significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

*Yaqi Zhao,Xiaochen Wang,Li Dong,Wentao Zhang,Yuhui Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 扩散模型在文本到图像生成中难以准确遵循计数指令，仅通过扩大数据集和模型规模无法解决此问题。研究发现模型过度依赖噪声初始化而非文本提示中的明确计数，并提出通过注入计数感知布局信息到噪声先验的有效方法，显著提升了计数准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究扩散模型是否能够通过扩大数据集和模型规模来准确生成文本提示中指定数量的对象，因为现有模型在计数任务上表现不佳。

Method: 构建了两个互补的合成计数基准数据集：GrayCount250用于控制缩放研究，NaturalCount6包含复杂自然场景。分析发现扩散模型过度依赖噪声初始化，并提出通过注入计数感知布局信息到噪声先验的方法。

Result: 缩放假设不成立：更大的模型和数据集无法改善计数准确性。提出的方法在GrayCount250上将准确率从20.0%提升到85.3%，在NaturalCount6上从74.8%提升到86.3%。

Conclusion: 扩散模型不能仅通过扩大规模来解决计数问题，需要专门的方法来引导模型关注文本提示中的计数信息。提出的计数感知布局注入方法能有效提升计数准确性并具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Numerosity remains a challenge for state-of-the-art text-to-image generation
models like FLUX and GPT-4o, which often fail to accurately follow counting
instructions in text prompts. In this paper, we aim to study a fundamental yet
often overlooked question: Can diffusion models inherently generate the correct
number of objects specified by a textual prompt simply by scaling up the
dataset and model size? To enable rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we
construct a clean synthetic numerosity benchmark comprising two complementary
datasets: GrayCount250 for controlled scaling studies, and NaturalCount6
featuring complex naturalistic scenes. Second, we empirically show that the
scaling hypothesis does not hold: larger models and datasets alone fail to
improve counting accuracy on our benchmark. Our analysis identifies a key
reason: diffusion models tend to rely heavily on the noise initialization
rather than the explicit numerosity specified in the prompt. We observe that
noise priors exhibit biases toward specific object counts. In addition, we
propose an effective strategy for controlling numerosity by injecting
count-aware layout information into the noise prior. Our method achieves
significant gains, improving accuracy on GrayCount250 from 20.0\% to 85.3\% and
on NaturalCount6 from 74.8\% to 86.3\%, demonstrating effective generalization
across settings.

Motivation: 传统精液分析无法评估精子DNA碎片化(SDF)，而SDF是男性生育能力评估的关键参数。本研究旨在开发一种非破坏性的实时精子选择方法，基于DNA完整性进行临床诊断和治疗应用。

Method: 利用精子形态与DNA完整性之间的已知联系，提出了一种形态辅助的集成AI模型，将图像处理技术与基于transformer的机器学习模型(GC-ViT)相结合，从相位对比图像预测精子DNA碎片化。

Result: 该集成模型实现了60%的敏感性和75%的特异性，表现优于纯transformer视觉模型和纯形态模型。

Conclusion: 这种非破坏性方法代表了生殖医学的重要进展，能够基于DNA完整性进行实时精子选择，具有临床诊断和治疗应用的潜力。

Abstract: Sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) is a critical parameter in male fertility
assessment that conventional semen analysis fails to evaluate. This study
presents the validation of a novel artificial intelligence (AI) tool designed
to detect SDF through digital analysis of phase contrast microscopy images,
using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)
assay as the gold standard reference. Utilising the established link between
sperm morphology and DNA integrity, the present work proposes a morphology
assisted ensemble AI model that combines image processing techniques with
state-of-the-art transformer based machine learning models (GC-ViT) for the
prediction of DNA fragmentation in sperm from phase contrast images. The
ensemble model is benchmarked against a pure transformer `vision' model as well
as a `morphology-only` model. Promising results show the proposed framework is
able to achieve sensitivity of 60\% and specificity of 75\%. This
non-destructive methodology represents a significant advancement in
reproductive medicine by enabling real-time sperm selection based on DNA
integrity for clinical diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

Abstract: Effective pneumonia diagnosis is often challenged by the difficulty of
deploying large, computationally expensive deep learning models in
resource-limited settings. This study introduces LightPneumoNet, an efficient,
lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) built from scratch to provide an
accessible and accurate diagnostic solution for pneumonia detection from chest
X-rays. Our model was trained on a public dataset of 5,856 chest X-ray images.
Preprocessing included image resizing to 224x224, grayscale conversion, and
pixel normalization, with data augmentation (rotation, zoom, shear) to prevent
overfitting. The custom architecture features four blocks of stacked
convolutional layers and contains only 388,082 trainable parameters, resulting
in a minimal 1.48 MB memory footprint. On the independent test set, our model
delivered exceptional performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 0.942,
precision of 0.92, and an F1-Score of 0.96. Critically, it obtained a
sensitivity (recall) of 0.99, demonstrating a near-perfect ability to identify
true pneumonia cases and minimize clinically significant false negatives.
Notably, LightPneumoNet achieves this high recall on the same dataset where
existing approaches typically require significantly heavier architectures or
fail to reach comparable sensitivity levels. The model's efficiency enables
deployment on low-cost hardware, making advanced computer-aided diagnosis
accessible in underserved clinics and serving as a reliable second-opinion tool
to improve patient outcomes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多流形证据融合方法MMEFnet，用于有效融合PolSAR协方差矩阵和多特征这两个互补视图，解决了传统方法忽略流形差异和不确定性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PolSAR协方差矩阵和提取的多特征位于不同流形上，传统融合方法忽略了这种几何结构差异，也不考虑不同视图的重要性差异和不确定性，导致预测不可靠。

Method: 将协方差矩阵建模在HPD流形上，多特征建模在Grassmann流形上，构建两个不同的核度量学习网络学习流形表示，然后用可信多视图证据融合估计置信质量并量化不确定性，最后基于Dempster-Shafer理论融合证据。

Result: 在三个真实PolSAR数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在准确性、鲁棒性和可解释性方面一致优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MMEFnet成功将PolSAR流形学习和证据融合整合到统一架构中，实现了更可靠和可解释的分类。

Abstract: Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) covariance matrices and their
extracted multi-features - such as scattering angle, entropy, texture, and
boundary descriptors - provide complementary and physically interpretable
information for image classification. Traditional fusion strategies typically
concatenate these features or employ deep learning networks to combine them.
However, the covariance matrices and multi-features, as two complementary
views, lie on different manifolds with distinct geometric structures. Existing
fusion methods also overlook the varying importance of different views and
ignore uncertainty, often leading to unreliable predictions. To address these
issues, we propose a Multiview Manifold Evidential Fusion (MMEFnet) method to
effectively fuse these two views. It gives a new framework to integrate PolSAR
manifold learning and evidence fusion into a unified architecture.
Specifically, covariance matrices are represented on the Hermitian Positive
Definite (HPD) manifold, while multi-features are modeled on the Grassmann
manifold. Two different kernel metric learning networks are constructed to
learn their manifold representations. Subsequently, a trusted multiview
evidence fusion, replacing the conventional softmax classifier, estimates
belief mass and quantifies the uncertainty of each view from the learned deep
features. Finally, a Dempster-Shafer theory-based fusion strategy combines
evidence, enabling a more reliable and interpretable classification. Extensive
experiments on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method consistently outperforms existing approaches in accuracy, robustness,
and interpretability.

TL;DR: CoPRS是一个基于多模态思维链的位置感知模型，通过可微分的热图将语言推理与分割连接起来，提高了可解释性并生成更精确的分割掩码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理分割方法要么直接将语言模型的隐藏特征连接到掩码解码器，要么用文本表示位置，这限制了可解释性和语义细节。

Method: 使用可学习的集中令牌聚合图像和推理文本特征，生成可微分的热图作为位置先验，通过轻量级解码器解码为精确掩码。

Result: 在RefCOCO系列和ReasonSeg数据集上，CoPRS在可比协议下达到或超过了最佳报告指标，在验证集和测试集上的性能均达到或超过先前最先进水平。

Conclusion: 热图质量强烈影响掩码质量，支持推理输出与下游掩码生成之间的一致性关联，该范式在连接推理和分割方面具有实用性。

Abstract: Existing works on reasoning segmentation either connect hidden features from
a language model directly to a mask decoder or represent positions in text,
which limits interpretability and semantic detail. To solve this, we present
CoPRS, a Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT)-based positional perception model
that bridges language reasoning to segmentation through a differentiable and
interpretable positional prior instantiated as a heatmap. By making the
reasoning process clear via MCoT and expressing it as a dense, differentiable
heatmap, this interface enhances interpretability and diagnostic analysis and
yields more concentrated evidence on the target. A learnable concentration
token aggregates features of the image and reasoning text to generate this
positional prior, which is decoded to precise masks through a lightweight
decoder, providing a direct connection between reasoning and segmentation.
Across the RefCOCO series and ReasonSeg, CoPRS matches or surpasses the best
reported metrics on each standard split under comparable protocols, with
performance at or above prior state of the art across both validation and test
partitions. Extensive experiments reveal that the quality of the heatmap
strongly influences the resulting mask quality, supporting a consistent
association between the reasoning output and downstream mask generation.
Collectively, these findings support the utility of this paradigm in bridging
reasoning and segmentation and show advantages in concentration driven by
reasoning and predicting masks more precisely. Code, checkpoints and logs are
released at https://github.com/ZhenyuLU-Heliodore/CoPRS.git.

Abstract: Sign languages serve as essential communication systems for individuals with
hearing and speech impairments. However, digital linguistic dataset resources
for underrepresented sign languages, such as Nepali Sign Language (NSL), remain
scarce. This study introduces the first benchmark dataset for NSL, consisting

TL;DR: 提出了DocReward文档奖励模型，专注于评估文档的结构和风格质量，解决了现有代理工作流主要关注文本质量而忽视视觉结构和样式的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的代理工作流自动化主要关注文本质量，忽视了视觉结构和样式对文档可读性和参与度的重要性，缺乏合适的奖励模型来指导生成具有良好结构和风格的文档。

Method: 构建了多领域数据集DocPair，包含117K对文档，涵盖32个领域和267种文档类型，每对包含内容和相同但结构和风格不同的高专业度和低专业度文档。使用Bradley-Terry损失训练DocReward模型来评分文档。

Result: DocReward在准确性上分别比GPT-4o和GPT-5高出30.6和19.4个百分点。在文档生成的外部评估中，DocReward获得了60.8%的胜率，显著高于GPT-5的37.7%。

Conclusion: DocReward能够有效评估文档的结构和风格质量，在指导生成代理产生人类偏好的文档方面表现出色，填补了现有文档生成工作流在视觉结构和样式评估方面的空白。

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic workflows have enabled the automation of tasks
such as professional document generation. However, they primarily focus on
textual quality, neglecting visual structure and style, which are crucial for
readability and engagement. This gap arises mainly from the absence of suitable
reward models to guide agentic workflows toward producing documents with
stronger structural and stylistic quality. To address this, we propose
DocReward, a document reward model that evaluates documents based on their
structure and style. We construct a multi-domain dataset DocPair of 117K paired
documents, covering 32 domains and 267 document types, each including a high-
and low-professionalism document with identical content but different structure
and style. This enables the model to evaluate professionalism comprehensively,
and in a textual-quality-agnostic way. DocReward is trained using the
Bradley-Terry loss to score documents, penalizing predictions that contradict
the annotated ranking. To assess the performance of reward models, we create a
test dataset containing document bundles ranked by well-educated human

*Xiang Ma,Litian Xu,Lexin Fang,Caiming Zhang,Lizhen Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PICO是一个新颖的跨模态对齐框架，通过抑制风格信息干扰来提升语义对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跨模态对齐方法假设嵌入仅包含语义信息，忽略了风格等非语义信息的影响，导致信息偏差或丢失。

Method: 提出PICO框架，量化每个特征列表示语义信息的概率，并将其作为嵌入交互的权重。采用基于性能反馈的原型迭代构建方法来确保语义概率的可靠性。

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型骨干上，PICO优于最先进方法5.2%-14.1%。

Conclusion: PICO通过有效抑制风格干扰，显著提升了跨模态对齐的性能。

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment is an important multi-modal task, aiming to bridge the
semantic gap between different modalities. The most reliable fundamention for
achieving this objective lies in the semantic consistency between matched
pairs. Conventional methods implicitly assume embeddings contain solely
semantic information, ignoring the impact of non-semantic information during
alignment, which inevitably leads to information bias or even loss. These
non-semantic information primarily manifest as stylistic variations in the
data, which we formally define as style information. An intuitive approach is
to separate style from semantics, aligning only the semantic information.
However, most existing methods distinguish them based on feature columns, which
cannot represent the complex coupling relationship between semantic and style
information. In this paper, we propose PICO, a novel framework for suppressing
style interference during embedding interaction. Specifically, we quantify the
probability of each feature column representing semantic information, and
regard it as the weight during the embedding interaction. To ensure the
reliability of the semantic probability, we propose a prototype iterative
construction method. The key operation of this method is a performance
feedback-based weighting function, and we have theoretically proven that the
function can assign higher weight to prototypes that bring higher performance
improvements. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and model backbones
demonstrate the superiority of PICO, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by
5.2\%-14.1\%.

TL;DR: 提出一个多模态自动化尺度条检测和提取框架，结合目标检测、文本检测、文本识别和LLM代理，用于SEM图像分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SEM图像中的尺度条确定目前主要依赖人工操作，既耗时又容易出错，需要自动化解决方案来提高效率和准确性。

Method: 采用四阶段框架：自动数据集生成、尺度条目标检测、混合OCR系统信息提取、LLM代理结果分析和验证。

Result: 目标检测精度100%，召回率95.8%，mAP 99.2%(IoU=0.5)；混合OCR系统精度89%，召回率65%，F1分数75%，优于主流独立引擎。

Conclusion: 基于LLM代理的自动化方法显著提高了SEM图像中尺度条检测和提取的效率和准确性，为科学图像分析提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Microscopic characterizations, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM),
are widely used in scientific research for visualizing and analyzing
microstructures. Determining the scale bars is an important first step of
accurate SEM analysis; however, currently, it mainly relies on manual
operations, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this
issue, we propose a multi-modal and automated scale bar detection and
extraction framework that provides concurrent object detection, text detection
and text recognition with a Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The proposed
framework operates in four phases; i) Automatic Dataset Generation (Auto-DG)
model to synthesize a diverse dataset of SEM images ensuring robust training
and high generalizability of the model, ii) scale bar object detection, iii)
information extraction using a hybrid Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
system with DenseNet and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) based
algorithms, iv) an LLM agent to analyze and verify accuracy of the results. The
proposed model demonstrates a strong performance in object detection and
accurate localization with a precision of 100%, recall of 95.8%, and a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 99.2% at IoU=0.5 and 69.1% at IoU=0.5:0.95. The
hybrid OCR system achieved 89% precision, 65% recall, and a 75% F1 score on the
Auto-DG dataset, significantly outperforming several mainstream standalone
engines, highlighting its reliability for scientific image analysis. The LLM is
introduced as a reasoning engine as well as an intelligent assistant that
suggests follow-up steps and verifies the results. This automated method
powered by an LLM agent significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of
scale bar detection and extraction in SEM images, providing a valuable tool for
microscopic analysis and advancing the field of scientific imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLEnD-Vis是一个多模态、多文化的基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型在日常文化知识方面的鲁棒性，涵盖语言改写和视觉模态，揭示当前模型在文化理解上的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在全球部署，评估其理解文化背景知识的能力变得至关重要。现有评估主要关注静态回忆或孤立视觉基础，未能检验模型是否具备鲁棒且可迁移的文化理解能力。

Method: 基于BLEnD数据集构建313个文化基础问题模板，涵盖16个地区，生成三种对齐的多选题格式：文本基线（地区→实体）、倒置文本变体（实体→地区）和VQA风格版本（带生成图像），包含4,916张图像和21,000多个多选题实例，并通过人工标注验证。

Result: BLEnD-Vis揭示了当前VLM文化知识的显著脆弱性：模型在语言改写下表现下降，虽然视觉线索通常有助于提升性能，但低跨模态一致性突显了在鲁棒整合文本和视觉理解方面的挑战，特别是对于资源较少的地区。

Conclusion: BLEnD-Vis为系统分析文化鲁棒性和多模态基础提供了关键测试平台，暴露了现有局限性，并指导开发更具文化能力的视觉语言模型。

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) are deployed globally, their ability to
understand culturally situated knowledge becomes essential. Yet, existing
evaluations largely assess static recall or isolated visual grounding, leaving
unanswered whether VLMs possess robust and transferable cultural understanding.
We introduce BLEnD-Vis, a multimodal, multicultural benchmark designed to
evaluate the robustness of everyday cultural knowledge in VLMs across
linguistic rephrasings and visual modalities. Building on the BLEnD dataset,
BLEnD-Vis constructs 313 culturally grounded question templates spanning 16
regions and generates three aligned multiple-choice formats: (i) a text-only
baseline querying from Region $\to$ Entity, (ii) an inverted text-only variant
(Entity $\to$ Region), and (iii) a VQA-style version of (ii) with generated
images. The resulting benchmark comprises 4,916 images and over 21,000
multiple-choice question (MCQ) instances, validated through human annotation.
BLEnD-Vis reveals significant fragility in current VLM cultural knowledge;
models exhibit performance drops under linguistic rephrasing and, whilst visual
cues often aid performance, low cross-modal consistency highlights challenges
in robustly integrating textual and visual understanding, particularly for
lower-resource regions. BLEnD-Vis thus provides a crucial testbed for
systematically analysing cultural robustness and multimodal grounding, exposing
limitations and guiding the development of more culturally competent VLMs.

TL;DR: 本文首次对监督学习检测器(YOLO)和零样本视觉语言模型(Gemini)进行成本效益分析，建立了架构选择的定量平衡点阈值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督检测需要大量标注成本，而零样本VLM虽然准确率较低但无需标注。需要系统比较两种方法的成本效益，为实际部署提供决策依据。

Method: 在1000张分层COCO图像和200张多样化产品图像上进行系统评估，结合详细的总拥有成本建模，建立定量平衡点阈值。

Result: 监督YOLO准确率91.2% vs 零样本Gemini 68.5%，但后者在100类别系统中节省10,800美元标注成本。零样本Gemini在多样化产品类别上达到52.3%准确率，而监督YOLO为0%。

Conclusion: 最优架构选择取决于部署量、类别稳定性、预算限制和准确率要求，而非纯粹的技术性能指标。

Abstract: Object detection systems have traditionally relied on supervised learning
with manually annotated bounding boxes, achieving high accuracy at the cost of
substantial annotation investment. The emergence of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) offers an alternative paradigm enabling zero-shot detection through
natural language queries, eliminating annotation requirements but operating
with reduced accuracy. This paper presents the first comprehensive
cost-effectiveness analysis comparing supervised detection (YOLO) with
zero-shot VLM inference (Gemini Flash 2.5). Through systematic evaluation on
1,000 stratified COCO images and 200 diverse product images spanning consumer
electronics and rare categories, combined with detailed Total Cost of Ownership
modeling, we establish quantitative break-even thresholds governing
architecture selection. Our findings reveal that supervised YOLO achieves 91.2%
accuracy versus 68.5% for zero-shot Gemini on standard categories, representing
a 22.7 percentage point advantage that costs $10,800 in annotation for
100-category systems. However, this advantage justifies investment only beyond
55 million inferences, equivalent to 151,000 images daily for one year.
Zero-shot Gemini demonstrates 52.3% accuracy on diverse product categories
(ranging from highly web-prevalent consumer electronics at 75-85% to rare
specialized equipment at 25-40%) where supervised YOLO achieves 0% due to
architectural constraints preventing detection of untrained classes. Cost per
Correct Detection analysis reveals substantially lower per-detection costs for
Gemini ($0.00050 vs $0.143) at 100,000 inferences despite accuracy deficits. We
develop decision frameworks demonstrating that optimal architecture selection
depends critically on deployment volume, category stability, budget
constraints, and accuracy requirements rather than purely technical performance
metrics.

Abstract: This paper explores the application of T5 models for Saudi Sign Language
(SSL) translation using a novel dataset. The SSL dataset includes three
challenging testing protocols, enabling comprehensive evaluation across
different scenarios. Additionally, it captures unique SSL characteristics, such
as face coverings, which pose challenges for sign recognition and translation.
In our experiments, we investigate the impact of pre-training on American Sign
Language (ASL) data by comparing T5 models pre-trained on the YouTubeASL
dataset with models trained directly on the SSL dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that pre-training on YouTubeASL significantly improves models'
performance (roughly $3\times$ in BLEU-4), indicating cross-linguistic
transferability in sign language models. Our findings highlight the benefits of
leveraging large-scale ASL data to improve SSL translation and provide insights
into the development of more effective sign language translation systems. Our
code is publicly available at our GitHub repository.

TL;DR: 提出FlexAC框架，通过调控多模态大语言模型中间层的表示来灵活控制联想推理强度，在保持事实准确性的同时增强创造力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM方法缺乏灵活调控联想推理强度的能力，限制了模型在事实性和创造性场景中的适应性

Method: 基于幻觉引导构建联想方向向量，选择高联想实例构建有效联想控制向量，并自适应校准强度以平衡创造性和输出稳定性

Result: 在Creation-MMBench上创造力提升5.8倍，在CHAIR上幻觉率降低29%，优于现有基线方法

Conclusion: FlexAC框架能够有效调控MLLM的联想推理行为，在事实准确性和创造性之间实现灵活平衡

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) face an inherent trade-off between
faithfulness and creativity, as different tasks require varying degrees of
associative reasoning. However, existing methods lack the flexibility to
modulate this reasoning strength, limiting MLLMs' adaptability across factual
and creative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose equipping MLLMs with
mechanisms that enable flexible control over associative reasoning. We begin by
investigating the internal mechanisms underlying associative behavior in MLLMs
and find that: (1) middle layers play a pivotal role in shaping model's
associative tendencies, (2) modifying representations in these layers
effectively regulates associative reasoning strength, and (3) hallucinations
can be exploited to derive steering vectors that guide this modulation.
Building on these findings, we introduce Flexible Association Control (FlexAC),
a lightweight and training-free framework for modulating associative behavior
in MLLMs. FlexAC first induces hallucination-guided intermediate
representations to encode associative directions. Then, it selects
high-association instances to construct effective associative steering vectors,
whose strengths are adaptively calibrated to balance creative guidance with
output stability. Finally, recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of
associative reasoning, FlexAC incorporates task-specific associative vectors
derived from a forward pass on a few target-domain samples, enabling models to
follow diverse associative directions and better adapt to creative tasks.
Notably, our method achieves up to a 5.8x improvement in creativity on
Creation-MMBench and a 29% reduction in hallucination rate on CHAIR, surpassing
existing baselines and demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling flexible
control over associative reasoning in MLLMs. Our code is available at

Motivation: 随着儿童在线媒体消费增长，需要数据驱动工具帮助教育工作者筛选适合幼儿的教育内容。目前缺乏专门针对幼儿教育内容检测的方法和数据集。

Method: 采用原型监督对比学习方法，为每个教育类别学习原型表示，最小化同类样本与原型的距离，最大化不同类样本与原型的距离。使用多模态transformer网络捕捉视频中视觉和音频线索的交互。

Result: 在自建数据集APPROVE（193小时专家标注视频，19个类别）上，该方法优于YouTube-8M和COIN等基准数据集上的强基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的多模态对比学习方法能有效检测在线视频中的教育内容，特别是在细粒度多标签分类场景下表现优异，为幼儿教育内容筛选提供了实用工具。

Abstract: The recent growth in the consumption of online media by children during early
childhood necessitates data-driven tools enabling educators to filter out
appropriate educational content for young learners. This paper presents an
approach for detecting educational content in online videos. We focus on two
widely used educational content classes: literacy and math. For each class, we
choose prominent codes (sub-classes) based on the Common Core Standards. For
example, literacy codes include `letter names', `letter sounds', and math codes
include `counting', `sorting'. We pose this as a fine-grained multilabel
classification problem as videos can contain multiple types of educational
content and the content classes can get visually similar (e.g., `letter names'
vs `letter sounds'). We propose a novel class prototypes based supervised
contrastive learning approach that can handle fine-grained samples associated
with multiple labels. We learn a class prototype for each class and a loss
function is employed to minimize the distances between a class prototype and
the samples from the class. Similarly, distances between a class prototype and
the samples from other classes are maximized. As the alignment between visual
and audio cues are crucial for effective comprehension, we consider a
multimodal transformer network to capture the interaction between visual and
audio cues in videos while learning the embedding for videos. For evaluation,
we present a dataset, APPROVE, employing educational videos from YouTube
labeled with fine-grained education classes by education researchers. APPROVE
consists of 193 hours of expert-annotated videos with 19 classes. The proposed
approach outperforms strong baselines on APPROVE and other benchmarks such as
Youtube-8M, and COIN. The dataset is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ControlNet倾向于复制原始训练分布，限制了数据增强效果。需要利用未标记域数据来扩展模型能力，特别是在存在大域偏移的场景下

Method: 在控制机制中引入不确定性概念，结合来自未标记数据集的不确定性控制和来自标记数据集的语义控制，生成目标域的高不确定性标注数据

Result: 在视网膜OCT图像和交通场景实验中，该方法显著改善了分割结果，无需额外监督即可处理大域偏移

Conclusion: 不确定性引导方法优于风格迁移，能够实现任意域偏移而无需严格学习图像风格，有效提升域外分割性能

Abstract: Generative Models are a valuable tool for the controlled creation of
high-quality image data. Controlled diffusion models like the ControlNet have
allowed the creation of labeled distributions. Such synthetic datasets can
augment the original training distribution when discriminative models, like
semantic segmentation, are trained. However, this augmentation effect is
limited since ControlNets tend to reproduce the original training distribution.
  This work introduces a method to utilize data from unlabeled domains to train
ControlNets by introducing the concept of uncertainty into the control
mechanism. The uncertainty indicates that a given image was not part of the
training distribution of a downstream task, e.g., segmentation. Thus, two types
of control are engaged in the final network: an uncertainty control from an
unlabeled dataset and a semantic control from the labeled dataset. The
resulting ControlNet allows us to create annotated data with high uncertainty
from the target domain, i.e., synthetic data from the unlabeled distribution
with labels. In our scenario, we consider retinal OCTs, where typically
high-quality Spectralis images are available with given ground truth
segmentations, enabling the training of segmentation networks. The recent
development in Home-OCT devices, however, yields retinal OCTs with lower
quality and a large domain shift, such that out-of-the-pocket segmentation
networks cannot be applied for this type of data. Synthesizing annotated images
from the Home-OCT domain using the proposed approach closes this gap and leads
to significantly improved segmentation results without adding any further
supervision. The advantage of uncertainty-guidance becomes obvious when
compared to style transfer: it enables arbitrary domain shifts without any
strict learning of an image style. This is also demonstrated in a traffic scene
experiment.

Motivation: 探究面部表情动态是否包含足够的身份信息，独立于静态面部特征，这对社交感知和临床评估有重要意义。

Method: 使用FLAME 3D可变形模型分离面部形状和表情动态参数，仅保留表情和下巴系数。采用Conformer模型和监督对比学习进行1,429路分类。引入漂移噪声比(DNR)量化形状-表情分离的可靠性。

Result: 在CANDOR数据集上达到61.14%的识别准确率，是随机猜测的458倍。DNR与识别性能呈强负相关，表明不稳定的形状估计会损害动态识别。

Conclusion: 面部动态携带强烈的身份特征，对话中的面部表情动态包含个体特异性签名，这对理解社交互动和开发临床评估工具具有重要价值。

Abstract: This work investigates whether individuals can be identified solely through
the pure dynamical components of their facial expressions, independent of
static facial appearance. We leverage the FLAME 3D morphable model to achieve
explicit disentanglement between facial shape and expression dynamics,
extracting frame-by-frame parameters from conversational videos while retaining
only expression and jaw coefficients. On the CANDOR dataset of 1,429 speakers
in naturalistic conversations, our Conformer model with supervised contrastive
learning achieves 61.14\%accuracy on 1,429-way classification -- 458 times
above chance -- demonstrating that facial dynamics carry strong identity
signatures. We introduce a drift-to-noise ratio (DNR) that quantifies the
reliability of shape expression separation by measuring across-session shape
changes relative to within-session variability. DNR strongly negatively
correlates with recognition performance, confirming that unstable shape
estimation compromises dynamic identification. Our findings reveal
person-specific signatures in conversational facial dynamics, with implications
for social perception and clinical assessment.

Conclusion: DTEA模型通过创新的跳跃连接框架有效提升了医学图像分割的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, skip connections are used to merge global
context and reduce the semantic gap between encoder and decoder. Current
methods often struggle with limited structural representation and insufficient
contextual modeling, affecting generalization in complex clinical scenarios. We
propose the DTEA model, featuring a new skip connection framework with the
Semantic Topology Reconfiguration (STR) and Entropic Perturbation Gating (EPG)
modules. STR reorganizes multi-scale semantic features into a dynamic
hypergraph to better model cross-resolution anatomical dependencies, enhancing
structural and semantic representation. EPG assesses channel stability after
perturbation and filters high-entropy channels to emphasize clinically
important regions and improve spatial attention. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets show our framework achieves superior segmentation accuracy
and better generalization across various clinical settings. The code is

Method: 引入Class Vectors概念，在微调过程中捕获类别特定的表示调整，将每个类别的适应在潜在空间中解耦，支持通过潜在特征引导或权重空间映射来更新决策边界。

Result: Class Vectors能够捕获每个类别的语义偏移，其固有的线性和正交性支持通过简单的类别算术实现高效、灵活的高级概念编辑。

Conclusion: Class Vectors为图像分类器编辑提供了有效的解决方案，在遗忘学习、环境适应、对抗防御等应用中验证了其实用性。

Abstract: Image classifiers play a critical role in detecting diseases in medical
imaging and identifying anomalies in manufacturing processes. However, their
predefined behaviors after extensive training make post hoc model editing
difficult, especially when it comes to forgetting specific classes or adapting
to distribution shifts. Existing classifier editing methods either focus
narrowly on correcting errors or incur extensive retraining costs, creating a
bottleneck for flexible editing. Moreover, such editing has seen limited
investigation in image classification. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce Class Vectors, which capture class-specific representation
adjustments during fine-tuning. Whereas task vectors encode task-level changes
in weight space, Class Vectors disentangle each class's adaptation in the
latent space. We show that Class Vectors capture each class's semantic shift
and that classifier editing can be achieved either by steering latent features
along these vectors or by mapping them into weight space to update the decision
boundaries. We also demonstrate that the inherent linearity and orthogonality
of Class Vectors support efficient, flexible, and high-level concept editing
via simple class arithmetic. Finally, we validate their utility in applications
such as unlearning, environmental adaptation, adversarial defense, and
adversarial trigger optimization.

Abstract: In recent years, while cloud-based MLLMs such as QwenVL, InternVL, GPT-4o,
Gemini, and Claude Sonnet have demonstrated outstanding performance with
enormous model sizes reaching hundreds of billions of parameters, they
significantly surpass the limitations in memory, power consumption, and
computing capacity of edge devices such as mobile phones. This paper introduces
AndesVL, a suite of mobile-side MLLMs with 0.6B to 4B parameters based on
Qwen3's LLM and various visual encoders. We comprehensively outline the model
architectures, training pipeline, and training data of AndesVL, which achieves
first-tier performance across a wide range of open-source benchmarks, including
fields such as text-rich image understanding, reasoning and math, multi-image
comprehension, general VQA, hallucination mitigation, multilingual
understanding, and GUI-related tasks when compared with state-of-the-art models
of a similar scale. Furthermore, we introduce a 1+N LoR

TL;DR: HaDola是一个人类不确定性感知的数据选择和自动标注框架，通过四阶段流程减少对昂贵人工标注的依赖，使视觉语言模型更准确且校准更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据集存在人类不确定性（HU）——人类标注信心的变化，但标准监督微调仅优化最频繁标签，忽略了HU分布。这引发了两个问题：HU如何影响SFT，以及如何在训练中有效利用HU。

Method: HaDola框架包含四个阶段：区分、自标注、错误触发和训练，通过迭代识别有害样本、优先选择信息丰富的样本，并从少量种子数据（5%数据）进行引导。

Result: 在VQAv2和VizWiz数据集上的广泛实验表明，HaDola使用更少的训练数据，持续匹配或优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在SFT中显式建模HU的重要性，表明更好地利用HU比单纯扩大数据集规模更有效。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance in Visual
Question Answering but still rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with
massive labeled datasets, which is costly due to human annotations. Crucially,
real-world datasets often exhibit human uncertainty (HU) -- variation in human
confidence across annotations -- but standard SFT simply optimizes toward the
most frequent label, disregarding HU distributions. This leaves two open
questions: How does HU affect SFT, and how can HU be effectively leveraged in
training? In this work, we first conduct a systematic evaluation of VLMs across
varying HU levels. We have two key findings: (i) surprisingly, high-HU samples
contribute little or even degrade model performance, and (ii) naively training
on the full dataset yields under-calibrated models that fail to capture HU
distributions. Motivated by these findings, we introduce HaDola, a human
uncertainty-aware data selection and automatic labeling framework. HaDola
operates in four stages -- discriminate, self-annotate, error trigger, and
training -- to iteratively identify harmful samples, prioritize informative
ones, and bootstrap from a small seed set (5\% of data). Our approach
substantially reduces reliance on costly HU annotations and makes VLMs more
accurate and better calibrated. Extensive experiments on VQAv2 and VizWiz
datasets demonstrate that HaDola consistently matches or outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines with less training data. Our work highlights the
importance of explicitly modeling HU in SFT, suggesting that better utilization
of HU is more effective than merely scaling up dataset size.

TL;DR: LikePhys是一个无需训练的方法，通过使用去噪目标作为ELBO似然代理来评估视频扩散模型中的直觉物理理解能力，在12个物理场景的基准测试中表现出与人类偏好强对齐的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于难以在生成过程中将物理正确性与视觉外观分离，准确评估视频扩散模型中的直觉物理理解能力仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 使用去噪目标作为ELBO似然代理，在精心策划的有效-无效视频对数据集上区分物理有效和不可能的视频。

Result: 提出的评估指标PPE在12个物理场景基准测试中与人类偏好强对齐，优于最先进的评估器基线。模型容量和推理设置的扩展显示出物理理解能力的明显改善趋势。

Conclusion: 尽管当前模型在处理复杂和混沌动力学方面仍有困难，但随着模型容量和推理设置的扩展，物理理解能力呈现出明确的改善趋势，同时不同物理定律之间存在领域特定的能力差异。

Abstract: Intuitive physics understanding in video diffusion models plays an essential
role in building general-purpose physically plausible world simulators, yet
accurately evaluating such capacity remains a challenging task due to the
difficulty in disentangling physics correctness from visual appearance in
generation. To the end, we introduce LikePhys, a training-free method that
evaluates intuitive physics in video diffusion models by distinguishing
physically valid and impossible videos using the denoising objective as an
ELBO-based likelihood surrogate on a curated dataset of valid-invalid pairs. By
testing on our constructed benchmark of twelve scenarios spanning over four
physics domains, we show that our evaluation metric, Plausibility Preference
Error (PPE), demonstrates strong alignment with human preference, outperforming
state-of-the-art evaluator baselines. We then systematically benchmark
intuitive physics understanding in current video diffusion models. Our study
further analyses how model design and inference settings affect intuitive
physics understanding and highlights domain-specific capacity variations across
physical laws. Empirical results show that, despite current models struggling
with complex and chaotic dynamics, there is a clear trend of improvement in
physics understanding as model capacity and inference settings scale.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ΔEnergy的新型OOD检测分数，通过重对齐视觉-语言模态时观察到的显著能量变化来改进OOD检测，并开发了EBM框架同时提升OOD泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在实际应用中会遇到分布内数据和分布外数据，其中分布外数据包括协变量偏移和语义偏移。需要改进模型对协变量偏移OOD数据的泛化能力，同时有效检测开放集语义偏移的OOD类别。

Method: 基于重对齐视觉-语言模态时观察到的能量显著变化，提出ΔEnergy OOD分数，并开发EBM框架通过ΔEnergy的下界最大化来同时提升OOD检测和泛化能力。

Result: 在具有挑战性的OOD检测和泛化基准测试中表现出优越性，AUROC指标比现有方法提升10%到25%。

Conclusion: ΔEnergy和EBM框架为视觉语言模型提供了一个统一的微调框架，能够同时改进OOD泛化和OOD检测的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent approaches for vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable
success in achieving fast downstream adaptation. When applied to real-world
downstream tasks, VLMs inevitably encounter both the in-distribution (ID) data
and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. The OOD datasets often include both
covariate shifts (e.g., known classes with changes in image styles) and
semantic shifts (e.g., test-time unseen classes). This highlights the
importance of improving VLMs' generalization ability to covariate-shifted OOD
data, while effectively detecting open-set semantic-shifted OOD classes. In
this paper, inspired by the substantial energy change observed in closed-set
data when re-aligning vision-language modalities (specifically by directly
reducing the maximum cosine similarity to a low value), we introduce a novel
OOD score, named {\Delta}Energy. {\Delta}Energy significantly outperforms the
vanilla energy-based OOD score and provides a more reliable approach for OOD
detection. Furthermore, {\Delta}Energy can simultaneously improve OOD
generalization under covariate shifts, which is achieved by lower-bound
maximization for {\Delta}Energy (termed EBM). EBM is theoretically proven to
not only enhance OOD detection but also yields a domain-consistent Hessian,
which serves as a strong indicator for OOD generalization. Based on this
finding, we developed a unified fine-tuning framework that allows for improving
VLMs' robustness in both OOD generalization and OOD detection. Extensive
experiments on challenging OOD detection and generalization benchmarks
demonstrate the superiority of our method, outperforming recent approaches by
10% to 25% in AUROC.

TL;DR: Sketch2Symm是一个两阶段生成方法，通过语义桥接和对称约束从草图生成几何一致的3D形状。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于草图的3D重建挑战，因为草图输入抽象稀疏，缺乏足够的语义和几何信息。

Method: 引入语义桥接通过草图到图像翻译来丰富稀疏草图表示，并加入对称约束作为几何先验来利用日常物体的结构规律性。

Result: 在主流草图数据集上的实验表明，该方法在Chamfer距离、Earth Mover距离和F-Score方面优于现有基于草图的3D重建方法。

Conclusion: 验证了所提出的语义桥接和对称感知设计的有效性。

Abstract: Sketch-based 3D reconstruction remains a challenging task due to the abstract
and sparse nature of sketch inputs, which often lack sufficient semantic and
geometric information. To address this, we propose Sketch2Symm, a two-stage
generation method that produces geometrically consistent 3D shapes from
sketches. Our approach introduces semantic bridging via sketch-to-image
translation to enrich sparse sketch representations, and incorporates symmetry
constraints as geometric priors to leverage the structural regularity commonly
found in everyday objects. Experiments on mainstream sketch datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing
sketch-based reconstruction methods in terms of Chamfer Distance, Earth Mover's
Distance, and F-Score, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed semantic
bridging and symmetry-aware design.

Conclusion: EvoCAD证明了结合语言模型与进化算法在CAD生成任务中的有效性，新提出的拓扑指标为3D对象语义相似性评估提供了新视角。

Abstract: Combining large language models with evolutionary computation algorithms
represents a promising research direction leveraging the remarkable generative
and in-context learning capabilities of LLMs with the strengths of evolutionary
algorithms. In this work, we present EvoCAD, a method for generating
computer-aided design (CAD) objects through their symbolic representations
using vision language models and evolutionary optimization. Our method samples
multiple CAD objects, which are then optimized using an evolutionary approach
with vision language and reasoning language models. We assess our method using
GPT-4V and GPT-4o, evaluating it on the CADPrompt benchmark dataset and
comparing it to prior methods. Additionally, we introduce two new metrics based
on topological properties defined by the Euler characteristic, which capture a
form of semantic similarity between 3D objects. Our results demonstrate that
EvoCAD outperforms previous approaches on multiple metrics, particularly in
generating topologically correct objects, which can be efficiently evaluated
using our two novel metrics that complement existing spatial metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了SAR图像处理中不同预处理、洪水制图和水深估计方法对洪水模拟结果的影响，发现在整个处理流程中方法选择和参数调整都会显著影响最终结果精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 洪水制图和水深估计对于校准和验证水力模型至关重要，但SAR图像处理中不同方法选择和参数调整的影响尚未系统研究。

Method: 使用SAR图像评估各种预处理（特别是斑点噪声去除）、洪水制图和水深估计方法，考虑预处理图像、洪水图和水深场的集合，在法国加龙河2019和2021年两次洪水事件上进行验证。

Result: 斑点滤波器的选择会改变洪水范围估计达数平方公里；监督方法优于无监督方法，但调优后的无监督方法（如局部阈值或变化检测）可获得相当结果；预处理和洪水制图步骤的累积不确定性导致水深场估计高度可变。

Conclusion: 必须考虑整个处理流程（预处理、洪水制图和水深估计）及其相关超参数，应采用集合方法并考虑方法不确定性，而不是依赖单一配置。

Abstract: Flood mapping and water depth estimation from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
imagery are crucial for calibrating and validating hydraulic models. This study
uses SAR imagery to evaluate various preprocessing (especially speckle noise
reduction), flood mapping, and water depth estimation methods. The impact of
the choice of method at different steps and its hyperparameters is studied by
considering an ensemble of preprocessed images, flood maps, and water depth
fields. The evaluation is conducted for two flood events on the Garonne River
(France) in 2019 and 2021, using hydrodynamic simulations and in-situ
observations as reference data. Results show that the choice of speckle filter
alters flood extent estimations with variations of several square kilometers.
Furthermore, the selection and tuning of flood mapping methods also affect
performance. While supervised methods outperformed unsupervised ones, tuned
unsupervised approaches (such as local thresholding or change detection) can
achieve comparable results. The compounded uncertainty from preprocessing and
flood mapping steps also introduces high variability in the water depth field
estimates. This study highlights the importance of considering the entire
processing pipeline, encompassing preprocessing, flood mapping, and water depth
estimation methods and their associated hyperparameters. Rather than relying on
a single configuration, adopting an ensemble approach and accounting for
methodological uncertainty should be privileged. For flood mapping, the method
choice has the most influence. For water depth estimation, the most influential
processing step was the flood map input resulting from the flood mapping step
and the hyperparameters of the methods.

TL;DR: NV3D是一种新型的3D物体检测模型，通过从体素邻居中提取法向量特征来增强检测性能，并提出两种采样策略以大幅减少数据量同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态方法面临特征对齐挑战，而局部特征提取对于复杂的3D物体检测任务可能过于简化。

Method: 使用KNN和PCA计算每个体素的法向量，采用法向量密度采样和FOV感知分箱采样策略，并应用元素级注意力融合机制。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上，NV3D在汽车和自行车检测方面表现优异，无采样时分别达到86.60%和80.18% mAP，比基线Voxel R-CNN分别提高2.61%和4.23%。使用采样后仍能保持85.54% mAP，同时过滤掉约55%的体素。

Conclusion: 法向量特征能有效提升3D物体检测性能，提出的采样策略能显著减少计算量而不牺牲精度。

Abstract: Recent studies in 3D object detection for autonomous vehicles aim to enrich
features through the utilization of multi-modal setups or the extraction of
local patterns within LiDAR point clouds. However, multi-modal methods face
significant challenges in feature alignment, and gaining features locally can
be oversimplified for complex 3D object detection tasks. In this paper, we
propose a novel model, NV3D, which utilizes local features acquired from voxel
neighbors, as normal vectors computed per voxel basis using K-nearest neighbors
(KNN) and principal component analysis (PCA). This informative feature enables
NV3D to determine the relationship between the surface and pertinent target
entities, including cars, pedestrians, or cyclists. During the normal vector
extraction process, NV3D offers two distinct sampling strategies: normal vector
density-based sampling and FOV-aware bin-based sampling, allowing elimination
of up to 55% of data while maintaining performance. In addition, we applied
element-wise attention fusion, which accepts voxel features as the query and
value and normal vector features as the key, similar to the attention
mechanism. Our method is trained on the KITTI dataset and has demonstrated
superior performance in car and cyclist detection owing to their spatial
shapes. In the validation set, NV3D without sampling achieves 86.60% and 80.18%
mean Average Precision (mAP), greater than the baseline Voxel R-CNN by 2.61%
and 4.23% mAP, respectively. With both samplings, NV3D achieves 85.54% mAP in
car detection, exceeding the baseline by 1.56% mAP, despite roughly 55% of
voxels being filtered out.

Abstract: Interactive 3D scenes are increasingly vital for embodied intelligence, yet

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动概念发现方法往往无法将提取的概念与模型真实决策过程对齐，损害了解释的忠实性。

Method: 在非负矩阵分解基础上加入KL散度正则化项，在概念学习中融入分类器监督，强制预测一致性。

Result: 在ImageNet、COCO和CelebA数据集上的系统评估表明，FACE在忠实性和稀疏性指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FACE框架通过理论保证和实验验证，能够提供更忠实的概念解释，弥合低层特征与高层语义之间的差距。

Abstract: Interpreting deep neural networks through concept-based explanations offers a
bridge between low-level features and high-level human-understandable
semantics. However, existing automatic concept discovery methods often fail to
align these extracted concepts with the model's true decision-making process,
thereby compromising explanation faithfulness. In this work, we propose FACE
(Faithful Automatic Concept Extraction), a novel framework that augments
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
regularization term to ensure alignment between the model's original and
concept-based predictions. Unlike prior methods that operate solely on encoder
activations, FACE incorporates classifier supervision during concept learning,
enforcing predictive consistency and enabling faithful explanations. We provide
theoretical guarantees showing that minimizing the KL divergence bounds the
deviation in predictive distributions, thereby promoting faithful local
linearity in the learned concept space. Systematic evaluations on ImageNet,
COCO, and CelebA datasets demonstrate that FACE outperforms existing methods
across faithfulness and sparsity metrics.

Method: 构建SAgoge数据集（最大最全面的SVG多模态数据集）、SArena基准（标准化评估），开发InternSVG模型（使用SVG专用特殊标记、子词嵌入初始化、两阶段训练策略）。

Result: 在SArena和现有基准测试中，InternSVG相比领先的开源和专有模型都取得了显著性能提升，表现出优越的统一建模能力。

Conclusion: InternSVG通过统一的数据-基准-模型套件，成功实现了SVG理解、编辑和生成任务的统一建模，证明了多模态大语言模型在SVG领域的强大潜力。

Abstract: General SVG modeling remains challenging due to fragmented datasets, limited
transferability of methods across tasks, and the difficulty of handling
structural complexity. In response, we leverage the strong transfer and
generalization capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to
achieve unified modeling for SVG understanding, editing, and generation. We
present the InternSVG family, an integrated data-benchmark-model suite. At its
core is SAgoge, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal dataset for SVG
tasks, encompassing both static graphics and dynamic animations. It covers
icons, long-sequence illustrations, scientific diagrams, and dynamic
animations, supporting tasks of varied difficulty levels and providing deeper
hierarchies with richer attributes compared to previous datasets. Based on this
resource, we introduce SArena, a companion benchmark with comprehensive task
definitions and standardized evaluation that aligns with the domains and
difficulty spectrum covered by SAgoge. Building on these foundations, we
propose InternSVG, a unified MLLM for SVG understanding, editing, and
generation with SVG-specific special tokens, subword-based embedding
initialization, and a two-stage training strategy that progresses from short
static SVGs to long-sequence illustrations and complex animations. This unified
formulation induces positive transfer and improves overall performance.
Experiments on SArena and prior benchmark confirm that InternSVG achieves
substantial gains and consistently outperforms leading open and proprietary
counterparts.

Conclusion: MMAP通过同时解决局部特征粒度和全局上下文覆盖问题，显著提升了从组织学图像预测空间基因表达的性能。

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) enables the measurement of gene expression while
preserving spatial information, offering critical insights into tissue
architecture and disease pathology. Recent developments have explored the use
of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) to predict
transcriptome-wide gene expression profiles through deep neural networks. This
task is commonly framed as a regression problem, where each input corresponds
to a localized image patch extracted from the WSI. However, predicting spatial
gene expression from histological images remains a challenging problem due to
the significant modality gap between visual features and molecular signals.
Recent studies have attempted to incorporate both local and global information
into predictive models. Nevertheless, existing methods still suffer from two
key limitations: (1) insufficient granularity in local feature extraction, and
(2) inadequate coverage of global spatial context. In this work, we propose a
novel framework, MMAP (Multi-MAgnification and Prototype-enhanced
architecture), that addresses both challenges simultaneously. To enhance local
feature granularity, MMAP leverages multi-magnification patch representations
that capture fine-grained histological details. To improve global contextual
understanding, it learns a set of latent prototype embeddings that serve as
compact representations of slide-level information. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that MMAP consistently outperforms all existing
state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics, including Mean
Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Pearson Correlation
Coefficient (PCC).

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models
(VLMs) have shown significant progress in mathematical reasoning, yet they
still face a critical bottleneck with problems requiring visual assistance,
such as drawing auxiliary lines or plotting functions to solve the problems.
Most LLMs and VLMs are constrained to text-only reasoning chains, while
multimodal unified models that can generate interleaved text and images lack
the necessary precision and controllability for such tasks. To address this, we
propose CodePlot-CoT, a code-driven Chain-of-Thought paradigm for "thinking
with images" in mathematics. Our approach leverages the VLM to generate text
reasoning as well as executable plotting code, which is then rendered into
images as "visual thought", to solve mathematical problems. To achieve this, we
first construct Math-VR, the first large-scale, bilingual dataset and benchmark
for Mathematics problems with Visual Reasoning, comprising 178K samples.
Second, to create high-quality training data, we develop a state-of-the-art
image-to-code converter specialized for parsing complex mathematical figures
into codes. Finally, using these training data, we train the CodePlot-CoT model
for solving mathematical problems. Experimental results show that our model
achieves up to 21% increase over base model on our new benchmark, fully
validating the efficacy of our proposed code-driven reasoning paradigm. Our
work opens a new direction for multimodal mathematical reasoning and provides
the community with the first large-scale dataset, comprehensive benchmark, and
strong approach for such problems. To facilitate future research, we make our
datasets, code, and pretrained models publicly available at

Abstract: Reasoning-based image quality assessment (IQA) models trained through
reinforcement learning (RL) exhibit exceptional generalization, yet the
underlying mechanisms and critical factors driving this capability remain
underexplored in current research. Moreover, despite their superior
performance, these models incur inference energy usage and latency orders of
magnitude higher than their earlier counterparts, restricting their deployment
in specific scenarios. Through extensive experiments, this paper verifies and
elaborates that through RL training, MLLMs leverage their reasoning capability
to convert redundant visual representations into compact, cross-domain aligned
text representations. This conversion is precisely the source of the
generalization exhibited by these reasoning-based IQA models. Building on this
fundamental insight, we propose a novel algorithm, RALI, which employs
contrastive learning to directly align images with these generalizable text
representations learned by RL. This approach eliminates the reliance on
reasoning processes and even obviates the need to load an LLM. For the quality
scoring task, this framework achieves generalization performance comparable to
reasoning-based models while requiring less than 5% of their model parameters
and inference time.

Conclusion: 多视角一致材质推断结合更基于物理的环境建模是学习准确反射的关键，该方法在高斯泼溅框架下实现了高质量的反射建模。

Abstract: Modeling reflections from 2D images is essential for photorealistic rendering
and novel view synthesis. Recent approaches enhance Gaussian primitives with
reflection-related material attributes to enable physically based rendering
(PBR) with Gaussian Splatting. However, the material inference often lacks
sufficient constraints, especially under limited environment modeling,
resulting in illumination aliasing and reduced generalization. In this work, we
revisit the problem from a multi-view perspective and show that multi-view
consistent material inference with more physically-based environment modeling
is key to learning accurate reflections with Gaussian Splatting. To this end,
we enforce 2D Gaussians to produce multi-view consistent material maps during
deferred shading. We also track photometric variations across views to identify
highly reflective regions, which serve as strong priors for reflection strength
terms. To handle indirect illumination caused by inter-object occlusions, we
further introduce an environment modeling strategy through ray tracing with
2DGS, enabling photorealistic rendering of indirect radiance. Experiments on
widely used benchmarks show that our method faithfully recovers both
illumination and geometry, achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality in
novel views synthesis.

Conclusion: LM-EEC框架通过有效的特征融合和长期记忆管理，成功解决了自我-外部视角对应任务中的关键挑战，为智能助手的精确视觉引导提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Establishing object-level correspondence between egocentric and exocentric
views is essential for intelligent assistants to deliver precise and intuitive
visual guidance. However, this task faces numerous challenges, including
extreme viewpoint variations, occlusions, and the presence of small objects.
Existing approaches usually borrow solutions from video object segmentation
models, but still suffer from the aforementioned challenges. Recently, the
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has shown strong generalization capabilities
and excellent performance in video object segmentation. Yet, when simply
applied to the ego-exo correspondence (EEC) task, SAM 2 encounters severe
difficulties due to ineffective ego-exo feature fusion and limited long-term
memory capacity, especially for long videos. Addressing these problems, we
propose a novel EEC framework based on SAM 2 with long-term memories by
presenting a dual-memory architecture and an adaptive feature routing module
inspired by Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Compared to SAM 2, our approach features
(i) a Memory-View MoE module which consists of a dual-branch routing mechanism
to adaptively assign contribution weights to each expert feature along both
channel and spatial dimensions, and (ii) a dual-memory bank system with a
simple yet effective compression strategy to retain critical long-term
information while eliminating redundancy. In the extensive experiments on the
challenging EgoExo4D benchmark, our method, dubbed LM-EEC, achieves new
state-of-the-art results and significantly outperforms existing methods and the
SAM 2 baseline, showcasing its strong generalization across diverse scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于AIS监测的局限性，通过非合作卫星图像和融合方法识别暗船、验证合作交通，支持内河水域的海事领域感知。

Method: 使用YOLO v11目标检测模型检测和表征船舶及驳船，包括船舶类型、驳船覆盖、运行状态、驳船数量和航行方向。开发了4,550个标注实例的数据集。

Result: 船舶分类F1分数95.8%，驳船覆盖检测F1分数91.6%，运行状态分类F1分数99.4%，方向性准确率93.8%，驳船计数平均绝对误差2.4。空间可转移性分析显示准确率高达98%。

Conclusion: 融合非合作卫星传感与AIS数据的方法可行，支持近实时船队清单、异常检测和内河水域监视。未来工作将扩展标注数据集、纳入时间跟踪并探索多模态深度学习。

Abstract: Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) for inland waterways remains challenged by
cooperative system vulnerabilities. This paper presents a novel framework that
fuses high-resolution satellite imagery with vessel trajectory data from the
Automatic Identification System (AIS). This work addresses the limitations of
AIS-based monitoring by leveraging non-cooperative satellite imagery and
implementing a fusion approach that links visual detections with AIS data to
identify dark vessels, validate cooperative traffic, and support advanced MDA.
The You Only Look Once (YOLO) v11 object detection model is used to detect and
characterize vessels and barges by vessel type, barge cover, operational
status, barge count, and direction of travel. An annotated data set of 4,550
instances was developed from $5{,}973~\mathrm{mi}^2$ of Lower Mississippi River
imagery. Evaluation on a held-out test set demonstrated vessel classification
(tugboat, crane barge, bulk carrier, cargo ship, and hopper barge) with an F1
score of 95.8\%; barge cover (covered or uncovered) detection yielded an F1
score of 91.6\%; operational status (staged or in motion) classification
reached an F1 score of 99.4\%. Directionality (upstream, downstream) yielded
93.8\% accuracy. The barge count estimation resulted in a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 2.4 barges. Spatial transferability analysis across geographically
disjoint river segments showed accuracy was maintained as high as 98\%. These
results underscore the viability of integrating non-cooperative satellite
sensing with AIS fusion. This approach enables near-real-time fleet
inventories, supports anomaly detection, and generates high-quality data for
inland waterway surveillance. Future work will expand annotated datasets,
incorporate temporal tracking, and explore multi-modal deep learning to further
enhance operational scalability.

Result: 大量实验表明，VGDCFusion在各种退化图像场景下显著优于现有最先进的融合方法

Conclusion: 该方法成功将退化建模与融合过程耦合，利用VLM实现退化感知和引导抑制，为退化图像融合提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Existing Infrared and Visible Image Fusion (IVIF) methods typically assume
high-quality inputs. However, when handing degraded images, these methods
heavily rely on manually switching between different pre-processing techniques.
This decoupling of degradation handling and image fusion leads to significant
performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel VLM-Guided
Degradation-Coupled Fusion network (VGDCFusion), which tightly couples
degradation modeling with the fusion process and leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) for degradation-aware perception and guided suppression.
Specifically, the proposed Specific-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Extractor
(SPDCE) enables modality-specific degradation awareness and establishes a joint
modeling of degradation suppression and intra-modal feature extraction. In
parallel, the Joint-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Fusion (JPDCF) facilitates
cross-modal degradation perception and couples residual degradation filtering
with complementary cross-modal feature fusion. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our VGDCFusion significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art fusion approaches under various degraded image scenarios. Our
code is available at https://github.com/Lmmh058/VGDCFusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在高质量实时新视角合成方面表现出色，但其表面重建能力尚未充分探索。由于高斯点的离散和非结构化特性，仅基于图像渲染损失的监督往往导致不准确的几何和视图间不一致。

Method: 1) 将边缘感知图像线索融入渲染损失以改善表面边界描绘；2) 引入可见性感知光度对齐损失来强制视图间几何一致性；3) 加入法向量约束来细化高斯点的空间方向；4) 利用深度图像特征嵌入来增强跨视图一致性。

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法在表面重建和新视角合成方面均达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过视图对齐方法有效增强了3D高斯泼溅的几何表示能力，在保持高效渲染的同时显著提升了表面重建质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently emerged as an efficient solution for
high-quality and real-time novel view synthesis. However, its capability for
accurate surface reconstruction remains underexplored. Due to the discrete and
unstructured nature of Gaussians, supervision based solely on image rendering
loss often leads to inaccurate geometry and inconsistent multi-view alignment.
In this work, we propose a novel method that enhances the geometric
representation of 3D Gaussians through view alignment (VA). Specifically, we
incorporate edge-aware image cues into the rendering loss to improve surface
boundary delineation. To enforce geometric consistency across views, we
introduce a visibility-aware photometric alignment loss that models occlusions
and encourages accurate spatial relationships among Gaussians. To further
mitigate ambiguities caused by lighting variations, we incorporate normal-based
constraints to refine the spatial orientation of Gaussians and improve local
surface estimation. Additionally, we leverage deep image feature embeddings to
enforce cross-view consistency, enhancing the robustness of the learned
geometry under varying viewpoints and illumination. Extensive experiments on
standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis. The source

Conclusion: 该方法通过组件级优化显著提高了法线积分的计算效率，同时保持了重建精度。

Abstract: Surface normal integration is a fundamental problem in computer vision,
dealing with the objective of reconstructing a surface from its corresponding
normal map. Existing approaches require an iterative global optimization to
jointly estimate the depth of each pixel, which scales poorly to larger normal
maps. In this paper, we address this problem by recasting normal integration as
the estimation of relative scales of continuous components. By constraining
pixels belonging to the same component to jointly vary their scale, we
drastically reduce the number of optimization variables. Our framework includes
a heuristic to accurately estimate continuous components from the start, a
strategy to rebalance optimization terms, and a technique to iteratively merge
components to further reduce the size of the problem. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results on the standard normal integration benchmark in as
little as a few seconds and achieves one-order-of-magnitude speedup over
pixel-level approaches on large-resolution normal maps.

Motivation: 当前3D数据集和评估基准往往孤立处理动态场景或动态情境，导致理解不完整。为克服这些限制，需要构建能够支持情境感知变化理解的综合数据集。

Method: 利用11K人类观察构建共享心智模型，整合自我中心和他者中心视角以及分类和坐标空间关系，使用LLM支持情境变化理解。提出SCReasoner方法，一种高效的3D MLLM方法，能够以最小参数开销进行点云比较。

Result: 在Situat3DChange任务上的综合评估显示了MLLMs在动态场景和情境理解方面的进展和局限性。数据扩展和跨域迁移实验证明了使用Situat3DChange作为训练数据集对MLLMs的任务无关有效性。

Conclusion: Situat3DChange数据集和SCReasoner方法为3D动态场景理解提供了重要基础，促进了人类-AI协作中的共享情境意识，并展示了在动态环境理解方面的潜力。

Abstract: Physical environments and circumstances are fundamentally dynamic, yet
current 3D datasets and evaluation benchmarks tend to concentrate on either
dynamic scenarios or dynamic situations in isolation, resulting in incomplete
comprehension. To overcome these constraints, we introduce Situat3DChange, an
extensive dataset supporting three situation-aware change understanding tasks
following the perception-action model: 121K question-answer pairs, 36K change
descriptions for perception tasks, and 17K rearrangement instructions for the
action task. To construct this large-scale dataset, Situat3DChange leverages
11K human observations of environmental changes to establish shared mental
models and shared situational awareness for human-AI collaboration. These
observations, enriched with egocentric and allocentric perspectives as well as
categorical and coordinate spatial relations, are integrated using an LLM to
support understanding of situated changes. To address the challenge of
comparing pairs of point clouds from the same scene with minor changes, we
propose SCReasoner, an efficient 3D MLLM approach that enables effective point
cloud comparison with minimal parameter overhead and no additional tokens
required for the language decoder. Comprehensive evaluation on Situat3DChange
tasks highlights both the progress and limitations of MLLMs in dynamic scene
and situation understanding. Additional experiments on data scaling and
cross-domain transfer demonstrate the task-agnostic effectiveness of using
Situat3DChange as a training dataset for MLLMs.

Abstract: Walking assistance in extreme or complex environments remains a significant
challenge for people with blindness or low vision (BLV), largely due to the
lack of a holistic scene understanding. Motivated by the real-world needs of
the BLV community, we build mmWalk, a simulated multi-modal dataset that
integrates multi-view sensor and accessibility-oriented features for outdoor
safe navigation. Our dataset comprises 120 manually controlled,
scenario-categorized walking trajectories with 62k synchronized frames. It
contains over 559k panoramic images across RGB, depth, and semantic modalities.
Furthermore, to emphasize real-world relevance, each trajectory involves
outdoor corner cases and accessibility-specific landmarks for BLV users.
Additionally, we generate mmWalkVQA, a VQA benchmark with over 69k visual
question-answer triplets across 9 categories tailored for safe and informed
walking assistance. We evaluate state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
using zero- and few-shot settings and found they struggle with our risk

Conclusion: 大规模激活在局部细节合成中起关键作用，提出的DG策略能有效增强DiT模型的细节保真度。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently emerged as a powerful backbone
for visual generation. Recent observations reveal \emph{Massive Activations}
(MAs) in their internal feature maps, yet their function remains poorly
understood. In this work, we systematically investigate these activations to
elucidate their role in visual generation. We found that these massive
activations occur across all spatial tokens, and their distribution is
modulated by the input timestep embeddings. Importantly, our investigations
further demonstrate that these massive activations play a key role in local
detail synthesis, while having minimal impact on the overall semantic content
of output. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{D}etail
\textbf{G}uidance (\textbf{DG}), a MAs-driven, training-free self-guidance
strategy to explicitly enhance local detail fidelity for DiTs. Specifically, DG
constructs a degraded ``detail-deficient'' model by disrupting MAs and
leverages it to guide the original network toward higher-quality detail
synthesis. Our DG can seamlessly integrate with Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG),
enabling further refinements of fine-grained details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our DG consistently improves fine-grained detail quality
across various pre-trained DiTs (\eg, SD3, SD3.5, and Flux).

<details>

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在传统2D图像和视频理解上表现优异，但在全方位图像理解方面仍未被充分探索，需要专门的基准测试来评估其能力。

Method: 构建了包含2,000张全方位图像和4,000个标注问答对的ODI-Bench基准，涵盖10个细粒度任务；提出了Omni-CoT方法，通过思维链推理结合文本和视觉线索来增强模型理解能力。

Conclusion: 当前MLLMs在全景图像理解方面存在局限，ODI-Bench为这一领域提供了标准化评估，Omni-CoT方法有效提升了模型性能，为全方位图像理解研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Omnidirectional images (ODIs) provide full 360x180 view which are widely
adopted in VR, AR and embodied intelligence applications. While multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
conventional 2D image and video understanding benchmarks, their ability to
comprehend the immersive environments captured by ODIs remains largely
unexplored. To address this gap, we first present ODI-Bench, a novel
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for omnidirectional image
understanding. ODI-Bench contains 2,000 high-quality omnidirectional images and
over 4,000 manually annotated question-answering (QA) pairs across 10
fine-grained tasks, covering both general-level and spatial-level ODI
understanding. Extensive experiments are conducted to benchmark 20
representative MLLMs, including proprietary and open-source models, under both
close-ended and open-ended settings. Experimental results reveal that current
MLLMs still struggle to capture the immersive context provided by ODIs. To this
end, we further introduce Omni-CoT, a training-free method which significantly
enhances MLLMs' comprehension ability in the omnidirectional environment
through chain-of-thought reasoning across both textual information and visual
cues. Both the benchmark and the code will be released upon the publication.

Abstract: Chest X-ray classification is vital yet resource-intensive, typically
demanding extensive annotated data for accurate diagnosis. Foundation models
mitigate this reliance, but how many labeled samples are required remains
unclear. We systematically evaluate the use of power-law fits to predict the
training size necessary for specific ROC-AUC thresholds. Testing multiple
pathologies and foundation models, we find XrayCLIP and XraySigLIP achieve
strong performance with significantly fewer labeled examples than a ResNet-50
baseline. Importantly, learning curve slopes from just 50 labeled cases
accurately forecast final performance plateaus. Our results enable
practitioners to minimize annotation costs by labeling only the essential
samples for targeted performance.

Abstract: Interactive 3D point cloud segmentation enables efficient annotation of
complex 3D scenes through user-guided prompts. However, current approaches are
typically restricted in scope to a single domain (indoor or outdoor), and to a
single form of user interaction (either spatial clicks or textual prompts).
Moreover, training on multiple datasets often leads to negative transfer,
resulting in domain-specific tools that lack generalizability. To address these
limitations, we present \textbf{SNAP} (\textbf{S}egment a\textbf{N}ything in
\textbf{A}ny \textbf{P}oint cloud), a unified model for interactive 3D
segmentation that supports both point-based and text-based prompts across
diverse domains. Our approach achieves cross-domain generalizability by
training on 7 datasets spanning indoor, outdoor, and aerial environments, while
employing domain-adaptive normalization to prevent negative transfer. For
text-prompted segmentation, we automatically generate mask proposals without
human intervention and match them against CLIP embeddings of textual queries,
enabling both panoptic and open-vocabulary segmentation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SNAP consistently delivers high-quality segmentation results.
We achieve state-of-the-art performance on 8 out of 9 zero-shot benchmarks for
spatial-prompted segmentation and demonstrate competitive results on all 5
text-prompted benchmarks. These results show that a unified model can match or
exceed specialized domain-specific approaches, providing a practical tool for
scalable 3D annotation. Project page is at, https://neu-vi.github.io/SNAP/

Abstract: Foundation models are transforming Earth observation, but their potential for
hyperspectral crop mapping remains underexplored. This study benchmarks three
foundation models for cereal crop mapping using hyperspectral imagery:
HyperSigma, DOFA, and Vision Transformers pre-trained on the SpectralEarth
dataset (a large multitemporal hyperspectral archive). Models were fine-tuned
on manually labeled data from a training region and evaluated on an independent
test region. Performance was measured with overall accuracy (OA), average
accuracy (AA), and F1-score. HyperSigma achieved an OA of 34.5% (+/- 1.8%),
DOFA reached 62.6% (+/- 3.5%), and the SpectralEarth model achieved an OA of
93.5% (+/- 0.8%). A compact SpectralEarth variant trained from scratch achieved
91%, highlighting the importance of model architecture for strong
generalization across geographic regions and sensor platforms. These results
provide a systematic evaluation of foundation models for operational
hyperspectral crop mapping and outline directions for future model development.

TL;DR: MS-Mix是一种情感感知的多模态数据增强框架，通过情感感知样本选择、情感强度引导的混合比例计算和情感对齐损失，解决多模态情感分析中数据稀缺和随机混合导致的语义不一致问题。


<details>

Result: 在三个基准数据集和六个最先进主干网络上的广泛实验表明，MS-Mix持续优于现有方法，为鲁棒的多模态情感增强建立了新标准。

Conclusion: MS-Mix通过情感感知的混合机制有效解决了多模态情感分析中的数据增强问题，显著提升了模型性能，为多模态情感分析提供了更鲁棒的增强方法。

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) aims to identify and interpret human
emotions by integrating information from heterogeneous data sources such as
text, video, and audio. While deep learning models have advanced in network
architecture design, they remain heavily limited by scarce multimodal annotated
data. Although Mixup-based augmentation improves generalization in unimodal
tasks, its direct application to MSA introduces critical challenges: random
mixing often amplifies label ambiguity and semantic inconsistency due to the
lack of emotion-aware mixing mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose
MS-Mix, an adaptive, emotion-sensitive augmentation framework that
automatically optimizes sample mixing in multimodal settings. The key
components of MS-Mix include: (1) a Sentiment-Aware Sample Selection (SASS)
strategy that effectively prevents semantic confusion caused by mixing samples
with contradictory emotions. (2) a Sentiment Intensity Guided (SIG) module
using multi-head self-attention to compute modality-specific mixing ratios
dynamically based on their respective emotional intensities. (3) a Sentiment
Alignment Loss (SAL) that aligns the prediction distributions across
modalities, and incorporates the Kullback-Leibler-based loss as an additional
regularization term to train the emotion intensity predictor and the backbone
network jointly. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets with six
state-of-the-art backbones confirm that MS-Mix consistently outperforms
existing methods, establishing a new standard for robust multimodal sentiment
augmentation. The source code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出ACE-G方法，将坐标回归器和地图表示分离为通用变换器和场景特定地图代码，通过在大规模场景上预训练变换器，显著提升了视觉重定位的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统场景坐标回归方法在训练视图和查询图像成像条件差异较大时会失败，因为其设计上会过拟合训练视图。需要解决SCR方法的泛化能力不足问题。

Method: 将坐标回归器和地图表示分离为通用变换器（预训练于数万场景）和场景特定地图代码，训练变换器从映射图像泛化到未见过的查询图像。

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的重定位数据集上，ACE-G方法显著提高了鲁棒性，同时保持了有吸引力的计算开销。

Conclusion: 通过分离坐标回归器和地图表示，并预训练变换器，ACE-G成功解决了SCR方法的泛化问题，实现了更好的重定位性能。

Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) has established itself as a promising
learning-based approach to visual relocalization. After mere minutes of
scene-specific training, SCR models estimate camera poses of query images with
high accuracy. Still, SCR methods fall short of the generalization capabilities
of more classical feature-matching approaches. When imaging conditions of query
images, such as lighting or viewpoint, are too different from the training
views, SCR models fail. Failing to generalize is an inherent limitation of
previous SCR frameworks, since their training objective is to encode the
training views in the weights of the coordinate regressor itself. The regressor
essentially overfits to the training views, by design. We propose to separate
the coordinate regressor and the map representation into a generic transformer
and a scene-specific map code. This separation allows us to pre-train the
transformer on tens of thousands of scenes. More importantly, it allows us to
train the transformer to generalize from mapping images to unseen query images
during pre-training. We demonstrate on multiple challenging relocalization
datasets that our method, ACE-G, leads to significantly increased robustness
while keeping the computational footprint attractive.

TL;DR: ExpVid是首个专门评估多模态大语言模型在科学实验视频理解能力上的基准测试，包含细粒度感知、程序理解和科学推理三个层次的任务，揭示了现有模型在细节区分、状态跟踪和科学关联方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试忽视了真实实验室工作的细粒度和长期性特点，特别是湿实验室环境，无法准确评估MLLMs在科学发现加速方面的真正潜力。

Method: 从同行评审的视频出版物中构建ExpVid基准，采用三层任务层次结构，结合自动化生成和多学科专家验证的视觉中心标注流程。

Result: 评估19个领先MLLMs发现，它们在粗粒度识别上表现良好，但在细节区分、状态变化跟踪和实验程序与科学结论关联方面存在困难，专有模型与开源模型之间存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: ExpVid不仅提供了诊断工具，还为开发能够成为科学实验可信赖伙伴的MLLMs绘制了路线图。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold promise for accelerating
scientific discovery by interpreting complex experimental procedures. However,
their true capabilities are poorly understood, as existing benchmarks neglect
the fine-grained and long-horizon nature of authentic laboratory work,
especially in wet-lab settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce ExpVid, the
first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs on scientific
experiment videos. Curated from peer-reviewed video publications, ExpVid
features a new three-level task hierarchy that mirrors the scientific process:
(1) Fine-grained Perception of tools, materials, and actions; (2) Procedural
Understanding of step order and completeness; and (3) Scientific Reasoning that
connects the full experiment to its published conclusions. Our vision-centric
annotation pipeline, combining automated generation with multi-disciplinary
expert validation, ensures that tasks require visual grounding. We evaluate 19
leading MLLMs on ExpVid and find that while they excel at coarse-grained
recognition, they struggle with disambiguating fine details, tracking state
changes over time, and linking experimental procedures to scientific outcomes.
Our results reveal a notable performance gap between proprietary and
open-source models, particularly in high-order reasoning. ExpVid not only
provides a diagnostic tool but also charts a roadmap for developing MLLMs
capable of becoming trustworthy partners in scientific experimentation.

TL;DR: LLF-LUT++是一种金字塔网络，通过拉普拉斯金字塔分解和重建整合全局和局部操作，在保持高性能的同时实现高分辨率图像的快速处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有照片增强方法要么注重性能但无法在边缘设备部署，要么注重计算效率但实际应用性能不足，需要平衡性能与效率。

Method: 使用图像自适应3D LUT利用下采样图像的全局色调特征，结合空间频率变换器权重预测器提取权重，并通过局部拉普拉斯滤波器自适应细化高频边缘细节。

Result: 在HDR+数据集上PSNR提升2.64 dB，4K分辨率图像在单GPU上仅需13ms处理时间，在两个基准数据集上表现优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: LLF-LUT++成功平衡了照片增强的性能与效率，实现了高性能的实时图像增强。

Abstract: Photo enhancement plays a crucial role in augmenting the visual aesthetics of
a photograph. In recent years, photo enhancement methods have either focused on
enhancement performance, producing powerful models that cannot be deployed on
edge devices, or prioritized computational efficiency, resulting in inadequate
performance for real-world applications. To this end, this paper introduces a
pyramid network called LLF-LUT++, which integrates global and local operators
through closed-form Laplacian pyramid decomposition and reconstruction. This
approach enables fast processing of high-resolution images while also achieving
excellent performance. Specifically, we utilize an image-adaptive 3D LUT that
capitalizes on the global tonal characteristics of downsampled images, while
incorporating two distinct weight fusion strategies to achieve coarse global
image enhancement. To implement this strategy, we designed a spatial-frequency
transformer weight predictor that effectively extracts the desired distinct
weights by leveraging frequency features. Additionally, we apply local
Laplacian filters to adaptively refine edge details in high-frequency
components. After meticulously redesigning the network structure and
transformer model, LLF-LUT++ not only achieves a 2.64 dB improvement in PSNR on
the HDR+ dataset, but also further reduces runtime, with 4K resolution images
processed in just 13 ms on a single GPU. Extensive experimental results on two
benchmark datasets further show that the proposed approach performs favorably
compared to state-of-the-art methods. The source code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/fengzhang427/LLF-LUT.

Abstract: Instruction-guided video editing has emerged as a rapidly advancing research
direction, offering new opportunities for intuitive content transformation
while also posing significant challenges for systematic evaluation. Existing
video editing benchmarks fail to support the evaluation of instruction-guided
video editing adequately and further suffer from limited source diversity,
narrow task coverage and incomplete evaluation metrics. To address the above
limitations, we introduce IVEBench, a modern benchmark suite specifically
designed for instruction-guided video editing assessment. IVEBench comprises a
diverse database of 600 high-quality source videos, spanning seven semantic
dimensions, and covering video lengths ranging from 32 to 1,024 frames. It
further includes 8 categories of editing tasks with 35 subcategories, whose
prompts are generated and refined through large language models and expert
review. Crucially, IVEBench establishes a three-dimensional evaluation protocol
encompassing video quality, instruction compliance and video fidelity,
integrating both traditional metrics and multimodal large language model-based
assessments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IVEBench in
benchmarking state-of-the-art instruction-guided video editing methods, showing
its ability to provide comprehensive and human-aligned evaluation outcomes.

TL;DR: PhySIC是一个从单张RGB图像重建度量准确的人类和场景的框架，通过物理约束解决深度模糊、遮挡和接触不一致问题，在9秒内完成联合优化，显著提升重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在从单张图像重建人类和场景时面临深度模糊、遮挡和物理接触不一致的挑战，需要开发能够产生物理合理重建结果的方法。

Method: 从粗略的单目深度和人体估计开始，进行遮挡感知修复，融合可见深度与未缩放几何构建度量支架，合成缺失支撑表面，并通过置信度加权优化联合执行深度对齐、接触先验、避免穿透和2D重投影一致性。

Result: PhySIC显著优于单图像基线方法，将平均每顶点场景误差从641mm降低到227mm，PA-MPJPE减半至42mm，接触F1分数从0.09提升到0.51。

Conclusion: PhySIC通过将单张图像转换为物理合理的3D人-场景对，推进了可扩展的3D场景理解，能够处理多人交互并产生逼真的重建结果。

Abstract: Reconstructing metrically accurate humans and their surrounding scenes from a
single image is crucial for virtual reality, robotics, and comprehensive 3D
scene understanding. However, existing methods struggle with depth ambiguity,
occlusions, and physically inconsistent contacts. To address these challenges,
we introduce PhySIC, a framework for physically plausible Human-Scene
Interaction and Contact reconstruction. PhySIC recovers metrically consistent
SMPL-X human meshes, dense scene surfaces, and vertex-level contact maps within
a shared coordinate frame from a single RGB image. Starting from coarse
monocular depth and body estimates, PhySIC performs occlusion-aware inpainting,
fuses visible depth with unscaled geometry for a robust metric scaffold, and
synthesizes missing support surfaces like floors. A confidence-weighted
optimization refines body pose, camera parameters, and global scale by jointly
enforcing depth alignment, contact priors, interpenetration avoidance, and 2D
reprojection consistency. Explicit occlusion masking safeguards invisible
regions against implausible configurations. PhySIC is efficient, requiring only
9 seconds for joint human-scene optimization and under 27 seconds end-to-end.
It naturally handles multiple humans, enabling reconstruction of diverse
interactions. Empirically, PhySIC outperforms single-image baselines, reducing
mean per-vertex scene error from 641 mm to 227 mm, halving PA-MPJPE to 42 mm,
and improving contact F1 from 0.09 to 0.51. Qualitative results show realistic
foot-floor interactions, natural seating, and plausible reconstructions of
heavily occluded furniture. By converting a single image into a physically
plausible 3D human-scene pair, PhySIC advances scalable 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Generating realistic and controllable 3D human avatars is a long-standing
challenge, particularly when covering broad attribute ranges such as ethnicity,
age, clothing styles, and detailed body shapes. Capturing and annotating
large-scale human datasets for training generative models is prohibitively
expensive and limited in scale and diversity. The central question we address
in this paper is: Can existing foundation models be distilled to generate
theoretically unbounded, richly annotated 3D human data? We introduce
InfiniHuman, a framework that synergistically distills these models to produce
richly annotated human data at minimal cost and with theoretically unlimited
scalability. We propose InfiniHumanData, a fully automatic pipeline that
leverages vision-language and image generation models to create a large-scale
multi-modal dataset. User study shows our automatically generated identities
are undistinguishable from scan renderings. InfiniHumanData contains 111K
identities spanning unprecedented diversity. Each identity is annotated with
multi-granularity text descriptions, multi-view RGB images, detailed clothing
images, and SMPL body-shape parameters. Building on this dataset, we propose
InfiniHumanGen, a diffusion-based generative pipeline conditioned on text, body
shape, and clothing assets. InfiniHumanGen enables fast, realistic, and
precisely controllable avatar generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in visual quality,
generation speed, and controllability. Our approach enables high-quality avatar
generation with fine-grained control at effectively unbounded scale through a
practical and affordable solution. We will publicly release the automatic data
generation pipeline, the comprehensive InfiniHumanData dataset, and the
InfiniHumanGen models at https://yuxuan-xue.com/infini-human.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖物体特定先验或受限于姿态-形状纠缠和多阶段流程的泛化能力，需要开发能同时预测姿态、尺寸和形状的统一框架。

Method: 融合视觉基础模型的密集2D特征与部分3D点云，使用Transformer编码器和Mixture-of-Experts增强，并行解码器用于姿态-尺寸估计和形状重建，实现28 FPS实时推理。

Conclusion: 该框架为机器人和具身AI中的开放集6D理解建立了新标准，仅使用合成数据训练就能实现强大的跨类别泛化。

Abstract: Estimating an object's 6D pose, size, and shape from visual input is a
fundamental problem in computer vision, with critical applications in robotic
grasping and manipulation. Existing methods either rely on object-specific
priors such as CAD models or templates, or suffer from limited generalization
across categories due to pose-shape entanglement and multi-stage pipelines. In
this work, we propose a unified, category-agnostic framework that
simultaneously predicts 6D pose, size, and dense shape from a single RGB-D
image, without requiring templates, CAD models, or category labels at test
time. Our model fuses dense 2D features from vision foundation models with
partial 3D point clouds using a Transformer encoder enhanced by a
Mixture-of-Experts, and employs parallel decoders for pose-size estimation and
shape reconstruction, achieving real-time inference at 28 FPS. Trained solely
on synthetic data from 149 categories in the SOPE dataset, our framework is
evaluated on four diverse benchmarks SOPE, ROPE, ObjaversePose, and HANDAL,
spanning over 300 categories. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on seen
categories while demonstrating remarkably strong zero-shot generalization to
unseen real-world objects, establishing a new standard for open-set 6D
understanding in robotics and embodied AI.

TL;DR: 用预训练表示编码器（如DINO、SigLIP、MAE）替代传统VAE，构建表示自编码器（RAE），为扩散变换器提供高质量重建和语义丰富的潜在空间，解决了传统VAE的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DiT依赖的VAE编码器存在架构过时、潜在空间维度低、表示能力弱等限制，影响生成质量。需要探索更先进的编码器来提升扩散变换器的性能。

Method: 提出表示自编码器（RAE），结合预训练表示编码器和训练的解码器，使用轻量级宽DDT头使扩散变换器能在高维潜在空间中有效工作。

Result: 在ImageNet上取得显著成果：256x256无引导FID为1.51，256x256和512x512有引导FID均为1.13，收敛更快且无需辅助表示对齐损失。

Conclusion: RAE具有明显优势，应成为扩散变换器训练的新标准方法。

Abstract: Latent generative modeling, where a pretrained autoencoder maps pixels into a
latent space for the diffusion process, has become the standard strategy for
Diffusion Transformers (DiT); however, the autoencoder component has barely
evolved. Most DiTs continue to rely on the original VAE encoder, which
introduces several limitations: outdated backbones that compromise
architectural simplicity, low-dimensional latent spaces that restrict
information capacity, and weak representations that result from purely
reconstruction-based training and ultimately limit generative quality. In this
work, we explore replacing the VAE with pretrained representation encoders
(e.g., DINO, SigLIP, MAE) paired with trained decoders, forming what we term
Representation Autoencoders (RAEs). These models provide both high-quality
reconstructions and semantically rich latent spaces, while allowing for a
scalable transformer-based architecture. Since these latent spaces are
typically high-dimensional, a key challenge is enabling diffusion transformers
to operate effectively within them. We analyze the sources of this difficulty,
propose theoretically motivated solutions, and validate them empirically. Our
approach achieves faster convergence without auxiliary representation alignment
losses. Using a DiT variant equipped with a lightweight, wide DDT head, we
achieve strong image generation results on ImageNet: 1.51 FID at 256x256 (no
guidance) and 1.13 at both 256x256 and 512x512 (with guidance). RAE offers
clear advantages and should be the new default for diffusion transformer
training.

Conclusion: 这种新颖的混合方法在图像分类中具有更高效和鲁棒的潜力。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been established as the main
workhorse in image data processing; nonetheless, they require large amounts of
data to train, often produce overconfident predictions, and frequently lack the
ability to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions. To address these
concerns, we propose a new Bayesian topological CNN that promotes a novel
interplay between topology-aware learning and Bayesian sampling. Specifically,
it utilizes information from important manifolds to accelerate training while
reducing calibration error by placing prior distributions on network parameters
and properly learning appropriate posteriors. One important contribution of our
work is the inclusion of a consistency condition in the learning cost, which
can effectively modify the prior distributions to improve the performance of
our novel network architecture. We evaluate the model on benchmark image
classification datasets and demonstrate its superiority over conventional CNNs,
Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), and topological CNNs. In particular, we supply
evidence that our method provides an advantage in situations where training
data is limited or corrupted. Furthermore, we show that the new model allows
for better uncertainty quantification than standard BNNs since it can more
readily identify examples of out-of-distribution data on which it has not been
trained. Our results highlight the potential of our novel hybrid approach for
more efficient and robust image classification.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注模型设计，而全景图像生成质量不佳的主要原因是缺乏大规模、高质量的真实世界全景数据。

Method: 采用跨领域转换和领域内增强的关键模块，在图像级别通过视角图像引导和全景细化引入跨领域知识，在token级别应用混合监督包括圆形填充、偏航损失和立方体损失。

Result: 在文本到全景、修复和外延任务上的广泛实验表明，该方法在11个定量指标上实现了更好的边界一致性和图像保真度。

Conclusion: DiT360通过数据中心的视角和混合训练策略，有效提升了全景图像生成的质量和几何保真度。

Abstract: In this work, we propose DiT360, a DiT-based framework that performs hybrid
training on perspective and panoramic data for panoramic image generation. For
the issues of maintaining geometric fidelity and photorealism in generation
quality, we attribute the main reason to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
real-world panoramic data, where such a data-centric view differs from prior
methods that focus on model design. Basically, DiT360 has several key modules
for inter-domain transformation and intra-domain augmentation, applied at both
the pre-VAE image level and the post-VAE token level. At the image level, we
incorporate cross-domain knowledge through perspective image guidance and
panoramic refinement, which enhance perceptual quality while regularizing
diversity and photorealism. At the token level, hybrid supervision is applied
across multiple modules, which include circular padding for boundary
continuity, yaw loss for rotational robustness, and cube loss for distortion
awareness. Extensive experiments on text-to-panorama, inpainting, and
outpainting tasks demonstrate that our method achieves better boundary
consistency and image fidelity across eleven quantitative metrics. Our code is

by simply prompting them to visually mark points as they move over time. We
place a distinctively colored marker at the query point, then regenerate the
rest of the video from an intermediate noise level. This propagates the marker
across frames, tracing the point's trajectory. To ensure that the marker
remains visible in this counterfactual generation, despite such markers being
unlikely in natural videos, we use the unedited initial frame as a negative
prompt. Through experiments with multiple image-conditioned video diffusion
models, we find that these "emergent" tracks outperform those of prior
zero-shot methods and persist through occlusions, often obtaining performance
that is competitive with specialized self-supervised models.

*Takuya Nakabayashi,Navami Kairanda,Hideo Saito,Vladislav Golyanik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ev4DGS是首个仅从单目事件流中实现非刚性变形物体新视角渲染的方法，使用可变形3D高斯泼溅表示，无需RGB输入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法处理非刚性物体时需要额外的稀疏RGB输入，这在实践中存在限制。本文探索是否仅从事件流中就能学习类似模型。

Method: 通过1）将估计模型输出与2D事件观测空间相关的损失函数，2）从事件生成的二值掩码训练的粗糙3D变形模型，来回归可变形3D高斯泼溅表示。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，Ev4DGS的有效性，并优于多个可应用的朴素基线方法。

Conclusion: Ev4DGS证明了仅从事件流中学习非刚性变形物体新视角渲染模型的可行性，为事件相机在动态场景中的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Event cameras offer various advantages for novel view rendering compared to
synchronously operating RGB cameras, and efficient event-based techniques
supporting rigid scenes have been recently demonstrated in the literature. In
the case of non-rigid objects, however, existing approaches additionally
require sparse RGB inputs, which can be a substantial practical limitation; it
remains unknown if similar models could be learned from event streams only.
This paper sheds light on this challenging open question and introduces Ev4DGS,
i.e., the first approach for novel view rendering of non-rigidly deforming
objects in the explicit observation space (i.e., as RGB or greyscale images)
from monocular event streams. Our method regresses a deformable 3D Gaussian
Splatting representation through 1) a loss relating the outputs of the
estimated model with the 2D event observation space, and 2) a coarse 3D
deformation model trained from binary masks generated from events. We perform
experimental comparisons on existing synthetic and newly recorded real datasets
with non-rigid objects. The results demonstrate the validity of Ev4DGS and its
superior performance compared to multiple naive baselines that can be applied
in our setting. We will release our models and the datasets used in the
evaluation for research purposes; see the project webpage:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文是关于表格问答(TQA)的综述研究，系统梳理了基于大语言模型的表格问答方法，包括任务分类、挑战分析和未来方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格问答领域缺乏对任务形式、核心挑战和方法趋势的系统性组织与理解，特别是在强化学习等新兴研究方向出现后，需要提供结构化的综述来统一分散的研究脉络。

Method: 通过全面分类现有基准和任务设置，按挑战目标对当前建模策略进行分组，并分析其优缺点，重点关注基于大语言模型的方法。

Result: 提供了TQA研究的结构化概览，识别了未充分探索但及时的研究主题，为社区提供了统一的基础。

Conclusion: 该综述为TQA社区提供了整合的基础，使研究者能够更深入理解当前技术水平，并指导这个快速演进领域的未来发展。

Abstract: Table Question Answering (TQA) aims to answer natural language questions
about tabular data, often accompanied by additional contexts such as text
passages. The task spans diverse settings, varying in table representation,
question/answer complexity, modality involved, and domain. While recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress in
TQA, the field still lacks a systematic organization and understanding of task
formulations, core challenges, and methodological trends, particularly in light
of emerging research directions such as reinforcement learning. This survey
addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive and structured overview of TQA
research with a focus on LLM-based methods. We provide a comprehensive
categorization of existing benchmarks and task setups. We group current
modeling strategies according to the challenges they target, and analyze their
strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we highlight underexplored but timely
topics that have not been systematically covered in prior research. By unifying
disparate research threads and identifying open problems, our survey offers a
consolidated foundation for the TQA community, enabling a deeper understanding
of the state of the art and guiding future developments in this rapidly
evolving area.

*Yanran Chen,Lynn Greschner,Roman Klinger,Michael Klenk,Steffen Eger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM驱动的情绪框架显著降低了人类对逻辑谬误的检测能力（F1分数平均下降14.5%），且恐惧、悲伤等情绪比中性情绪更能增强谬误论点的说服力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 逻辑谬误在公共传播中普遍存在且具有误导性，但现有研究缺乏对情绪框架如何与谬误和说服力相互作用的理解。

Method: 使用大型语言模型系统性地改变谬误论点中的情绪诉求，同时保持其逻辑结构不变，然后进行人类研究。

Result: 人类在感知愉悦情绪时比恐惧或悲伤时能更好地检测谬误；恐惧、悲伤和愉悦情绪比中性或其他情绪状态显著提高了论点的说服力。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了AI驱动的情绪操纵在谬误论证中的潜在风险，需要引起重视。

Abstract: Logical fallacies are common in public communication and can mislead
audiences; fallacious arguments may still appear convincing despite lacking
soundness, because convincingness is inherently subjective. We present the
first computational study of how emotional framing interacts with fallacies and
convincingness, using large language models (LLMs) to systematically change
emotional appeals in fallacious arguments. We benchmark eight LLMs on injecting
emotional appeal into fallacious arguments while preserving their logical
structures, then use the best models to generate stimuli for a human study. Our
results show that LLM-driven emotional framing reduces human fallacy detection
in F1 by 14.5% on average. Humans perform better in fallacy detection when
perceiving enjoyment than fear or sadness, and these three emotions also
correlate with significantly higher convincingness compared to neutral or other
emotion states. Our work has implications for AI-driven emotional manipulation
in the context of fallacious argumentation.

TL;DR: 大语言模型在识别数字序列规律时存在过度识别不存在的模式的倾向，即使是在随机生成的数字序列中也会产生荒谬的模式识别


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型在复杂现实任务中的逻辑一致性和自洽性，因为现有方法如检索增强生成和AI代理框架都依赖于这些特性

Method: 通过让LLMs解释各种整数序列的模式进行实验，包括算术序列、几何序列和随机生成的整数序列

Result: 模型能正确识别算术和几何序列的模式，但在分析随机序列时频繁过度识别与给定数字不一致的模式，即使在多步推理模型中也存在此问题

Conclusion: 这种感知不存在模式的倾向类似于AI模型中的'部族偶像'，突显了即使在采用思维链推理机制时，LLMs在需要逻辑推理的应用任务中仍存在潜在局限性

Abstract: We present a tendency of large language models (LLMs) to generate absurd
patterns despite their clear inappropriateness in a simple task of identifying
regularities in number series. Several approaches have been proposed to apply
LLMs to complex real-world tasks, such as providing knowledge through
retrieval-augmented generation and executing multi-step tasks using AI agent
frameworks. However, these approaches rely on the logical consistency and
self-coherence of LLMs, making it crucial to evaluate these aspects and
consider potential countermeasures. To identify cases where LLMs fail to
maintain logical consistency, we conducted an experiment in which LLMs were
asked to explain the patterns in various integer sequences, ranging from
arithmetic sequences to randomly generated integer series. While the models
successfully identified correct patterns in arithmetic and geometric sequences,
they frequently over-recognized patterns that were inconsistent with the given
numbers when analyzing randomly generated series. This issue was observed even
in multi-step reasoning models, including OpenAI o3, o4-mini, and Google Gemini
2.5 Flash Preview Thinking. This tendency to perceive non-existent patterns can
be interpreted as the AI model equivalent of Idola Tribus and highlights
potential limitations in their capability for applied tasks requiring logical
reasoning, even when employing chain-of-thought reasoning mechanisms.

TL;DR: 提出SeCon-RAG框架，通过两阶段语义过滤和冲突检测机制来防御RAG系统中的语料库污染攻击，在保持有用知识的同时提升生成鲁棒性和输出可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG系统容易受到语料库污染和污染攻击，现有防御方法采用激进过滤导致有价值信息丢失和生成可靠性降低。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用EIRE指导的语义和聚类过滤，第二阶段使用EIRE引导的冲突感知过滤模块分析语义一致性。

Result: 在多种LLM和数据集上的实验表明，SeCon-RAG显著优于最先进的防御方法。

Conclusion: SeCon-RAG通过两阶段过滤过程有效保留有用知识同时减轻冲突污染，在生成鲁棒性和输出可信度方面取得显著改进。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models
(LLMs) with external knowledge but are vulnerable to corpus poisoning and
contamination attacks, which can compromise output integrity. Existing defenses
often apply aggressive filtering, leading to unnecessary loss of valuable
information and reduced reliability in generation. To address this problem, we
propose a two-stage semantic filtering and conflict-free framework for
trustworthy RAG. In the first stage, we perform a joint filter with semantic
and cluster-based filtering which is guided by the Entity-intent-relation
extractor (EIRE). EIRE extracts entities, latent objectives, and entity
relations from both the user query and filtered documents, scores their
semantic relevance, and selectively adds valuable documents into the clean
retrieval database. In the second stage, we proposed an EIRE-guided
conflict-aware filtering module, which analyzes semantic consistency between
the query, candidate answers, and retrieved knowledge before final answer
generation, filtering out internal and external contradictions that could
mislead the model. Through this two-stage process, SeCon-RAG effectively
preserves useful knowledge while mitigating conflict contamination, achieving
significant improvements in both generation robustness and output
trustworthiness. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and datasets
demonstrate that the proposed SeCon-RAG markedly outperforms state-of-the-art
defense methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReaLM是一个新颖的框架，通过残差向量量化将知识图谱嵌入与LLM标记化对齐，结合本体引导的类别约束，在知识图谱补全任务中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的知识图谱补全方法难以充分利用结构化语义表示，因为预训练KG模型的连续嵌入空间与LLM的离散标记空间存在根本性不匹配，这阻碍了有效的语义迁移并限制了性能。

Method: 使用残差向量量化机制将预训练KG嵌入离散化为紧凑的代码序列，并将其作为可学习标记集成到LLM词汇表中，实现符号知识和上下文知识的无缝融合；同时结合本体引导的类别约束来增强语义一致性。

Result: 在两个广泛使用的基准数据集上的大量实验表明，ReaLM实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ReaLM在将结构化知识与大规模语言模型对齐方面具有有效性，为知识图谱补全提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for
Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), offering strong reasoning and generalization
capabilities beyond traditional embedding-based approaches. However, existing
LLM-based methods often struggle to fully exploit structured semantic
representations, as the continuous embedding space of pretrained KG models is
fundamentally misaligned with the discrete token space of LLMs. This
discrepancy hinders effective semantic transfer and limits their performance.
To address this challenge, we propose ReaLM, a novel and effective framework
that bridges the gap between KG embeddings and LLM tokenization through the
mechanism of residual vector quantization. ReaLM discretizes pretrained KG
embeddings into compact code sequences and integrates them as learnable tokens
within the LLM vocabulary, enabling seamless fusion of symbolic and contextual
knowledge. Furthermore, we incorporate ontology-guided class constraints to
enforce semantic consistency, refining entity predictions based on class-level
compatibility. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets
demonstrate that ReaLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, confirming its
effectiveness in aligning structured knowledge with large-scale language
models.

*Shiyuan Guo,Henry Sleight,Fabien Roger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了AI模型在加密文本中进行推理的能力，发现即使模型能准确理解加密文本，其推理准确性也会显著下降，这表明使用加密推理来逃避思维链监控在当前模型上可能无效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI代理的广泛采用，检测有害AI行为变得重要。思维链监控是检测对抗性攻击和AI不对齐的常用方法，但攻击者和不对齐模型可能通过加密推理来逃避这种监控。

Method: 测试了28种不同密码，通过微调和提示最多10个模型在每种密码中进行推理，使用数学问题作为推理能力的代理指标，测量模型准确性。

Result: 发现模型在加密文本中的推理准确性显著下降，即使它们能准确将加密文本翻译成英文。前沿模型在不太知名的密码中表现不佳，但在知名密码如rot13中表现良好。加密推理能力与预训练数据中密码的流行度相关。

Conclusion: 使用加密推理来逃避思维链监控在当前模型上可能是无效的策略，并为限制未来前沿模型发展这种能力提供了指导。

Abstract: Detecting harmful AI actions is important as AI agents gain adoption.
Chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring is one method widely used to detect
adversarial attacks and AI misalignment. However, attackers and misaligned
models might evade CoT monitoring through ciphered reasoning: reasoning hidden
in encrypted, translated, or compressed text. To assess this risk, we test
whether models can perform ciphered reasoning. For each of 28 different
ciphers, we fine-tune and prompt up to 10 models to reason in that cipher. We
measure model accuracy on math problems as a proxy for reasoning ability.
Across the models we test, we find an asymmetry: model accuracy can drop
significantly when reasoning in ciphered text, even though models demonstrate
comprehension of ciphered text by being able to translate it accurately to
English. Even frontier models struggle with lesser-known ciphers, although they
can reason accurately in well-known ciphers like rot13. We show that ciphered
reasoning capability correlates with cipher prevalence in pretraining data. We
also identify scaling laws showing that ciphered reasoning capability improves
slowly with additional fine-tuning data. Our work suggests that evading CoT
monitoring using ciphered reasoning may be an ineffective tactic for current
models and offers guidance on constraining the development of this capability
in future frontier models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了偏好感知记忆更新机制(PAMU)，通过滑动窗口平均和指数移动平均的融合，动态优化LLM代理的长期记忆表示，在长期对话任务中显著提升输出质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长期记忆方法在记忆更新方面存在不足，缺乏根据用户行为和上下文变化动态优化偏好记忆表示的机制。

Method: PAMU机制整合滑动窗口平均(SW)和指数移动平均(EMA)，构建融合的偏好感知表示，捕捉短期波动和长期用户倾向。

Result: 在LoCoMo数据集的五个任务场景实验中，该机制显著提升了五个基线模型的LLM输出质量。

Conclusion: PAMU机制在长期对话中有效提升了LLM代理的推理能力，验证了动态记忆更新的重要性。

Abstract: One of the key factors influencing the reasoning capabilities of LLM-based
agents is their ability to leverage long-term memory. Integrating long-term
memory mechanisms allows agents to make informed decisions grounded in
historical interactions. While recent advances have significantly improved the
storage and retrieval components, by encoding memory into dense vectors for
similarity search or organizing memory as structured knowledge graphs most
existing approaches fall short in memory updating. In particular, they lack
mechanisms for dynamically refining preference memory representations in
response to evolving user behaviors and contexts. To address this gap, we
propose a Preference-Aware Memory Update Mechanism (PAMU) that enables dynamic
and personalized memory refinement. By integrating sliding window averages (SW)
with exponential moving averages (EMA), PAMU constructs a fused
preference-aware representation that captures both short-term fluctuations and
long-term user tendencies. We conduct experiments on five task scenarios of the
LoCoMo dataset, and the results show that our mechanism can significantly
improve the output quality of LLM in five baselines, validating its
effectiveness in long-term conversations.

Motivation: 自动化简历信息提取对于规模化人才招聘至关重要，但在实际部署中面临三大挑战：简历布局和内容的极端异构性、大语言模型的高成本和延迟、缺乏标准化数据集和评估工具。

Method: 结合微调的布局解析器来规范化不同文档格式，基于并行提示和指令调优的高效LLM提取器，以及由新基准数据集支持的鲁棒两阶段自动评估框架。

Result: 广泛实验表明，该框架在准确性和效率方面显著优于强基线。特别是，微调的0.6B紧凑LLM实现了顶级准确性，同时显著降低了推理延迟和计算成本。

Conclusion: 该系统已在阿里巴巴智能HR平台全面部署，支持其业务部门的实时应用，为自动化简历信息提取提供了高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated resume information extraction is critical for scaling talent
acquisition, yet its real-world deployment faces three major challenges: the
extreme heterogeneity of resume layouts and content, the high cost and latency
of large language models (LLMs), and the lack of standardized datasets and
evaluation tools. In this work, we present a layout-aware and
efficiency-optimized framework for automated extraction and evaluation that
addresses all three challenges. Our system combines a fine-tuned layout parser
to normalize diverse document formats, an inference-efficient LLM extractor
based on parallel prompting and instruction tuning, and a robust two-stage
automated evaluation framework supported by new benchmark datasets. Extensive
experiments show that our framework significantly outperforms strong baselines
in both accuracy and efficiency. In particular, we demonstrate that a
fine-tuned compact 0.6B LLM achieves top-tier accuracy while significantly
reducing inference latency and computational cost. The system is fully deployed
in Alibaba's intelligent HR platform, supporting real-time applications across
its business units.

TL;DR: EVisRAG是一个端到端的视觉检索增强生成框架，通过证据引导的多图像推理来减少幻觉，使用RS-GRPO优化方法在多个VQA基准上平均提升27%性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VRAG系统在多图像感知和证据整合方面不可靠，导致推理基础薄弱和错误结论。

Method: 提出EVisRAG框架：先观察检索图像并记录每张图像证据，然后从聚合证据推导最终答案；引入RS-GRPO方法将细粒度奖励绑定到范围特定token，联合优化VLM的视觉感知和推理能力。

Result: 在多个视觉问答基准测试中，EVisRAG相比骨干VLM平均提升27%性能；能够精确感知和定位多图像中问题相关证据，并基于证据推导最终答案。

Conclusion: EVisRAG通过证据引导的多图像推理有效提升了视觉检索增强生成系统的性能，RS-GRPO方法成功优化了视觉感知和推理能力的联合学习。

Abstract: Visual retrieval-augmented generation (VRAG) augments vision-language models
(VLMs) with external visual knowledge to ground reasoning and reduce
hallucinations. Yet current VRAG systems often fail to reliably perceive and
integrate evidence across multiple images, leading to weak grounding and
erroneous conclusions. In this paper, we propose EVisRAG, an end-to-end
framework that learns to reason with evidence-guided multi-image to address
this issue. The model first observes retrieved images and records per-image
evidence, then derives the final answer from the aggregated evidence. To train
EVisRAG effectively, we introduce Reward-Scoped Group Relative Policy
Optimization (RS-GRPO), which binds fine-grained rewards to scope-specific
tokens to jointly optimize visual perception and reasoning abilities of VLMs.
Experimental results on multiple visual question answering benchmarks
demonstrate that EVisRAG delivers substantial end-to-end gains over backbone
VLM with 27\% improvements on average. Further analysis shows that, powered by
RS-GRPO, EVisRAG improves answer accuracy by precisely perceiving and
localizing question-relevant evidence across multiple images and deriving the
final answer from that evidence, much like a real detective.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Judge's Verdict Benchmark，一种评估LLMs作为响应准确性评判者的两阶段方法，测试了54个LLMs在RAG或Agentic流程中复制人类判断的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统相关性分析不足以全面评估LLMs作为评判者的能力，需要更全面的方法来衡量实际一致性模式。

Method: 两阶段方法：1）相关性测试筛选强对齐的评判者；2）使用z分数的人类相似性测试，识别人类相似判断（|z|<1）和超一致判断（z>1）两种模式。

Result: 54个测试LLMs中有27个达到Tier 1性能：23个模型展现人类相似模式，4个展现超一致行为。评判者优秀程度不依赖模型大小，而依赖特定训练策略。

Conclusion: 相关性单独不足以评估评判者，需要基于一致性模式的"评判者图灵测试"，并提供标准化基准将LLM评判者分类到不同性能层级。

Abstract: This research introduces the Judge's Verdict Benchmark, a novel two-step
methodology to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges for response
accuracy evaluation tasks. We assess how well 54 LLMs can replicate human
judgment when scoring responses from RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) or
Agentic pipelines against ground truth answers. Our methodology progresses from
traditional correlation analysis to comprehensive Cohen's Kappa analysis that
measures actual agreement patterns. The two-step approach includes: (1) a
correlation test that filters judges with strong alignment, followed by (2) a
human-likeness test using z-scores to identify two distinct judgment patterns:
human-like judgment (|z| < 1) that mimics natural human variation, and
super-consistent judgment (z > 1) that exceeds typical human-to-human agreement
levels. This methodology reveals that 27 out of 54 tested LLMs achieve Tier 1
performance: 23 models exhibit human-like patterns that preserve the nuances of
human judgment, while 4 models demonstrate super-consistent behavior, a pattern
that could indicate either enhanced reliability or oversimplification of
complex judgments. Testing 43 open-source models (1B-405B parameters) and 11
closed models (GPT, Gemini, Claude variants), we demonstrate that judge
excellence is not solely dependent on model size but on specific training
strategies. Our key contributions include: (1) establishing that correlation
alone is insufficient for judge evaluation, (2) introducing a "Turing Test for
judges" based on agreement patterns, and (3) providing a standardized benchmark
for classifying LLM judges into distinct performance tiers for different
evaluation needs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Gold Panning Bandits框架，利用LLM的位置偏见作为诊断信号，通过重新排序文档来高效识别相关内容，相比随机排列基线减少65%的查询次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多文档环境中存在强烈的位置偏见，系统性地根据位置而非相关性优先处理信息。现有方法将此偏见视为需要缓解的噪声，而本文则将其转化为诊断信号。

Method: 将选择重新排序的问题构建为二分图匹配问题。虽然可以使用匈牙利算法在O(N^3)时间内计算最优分配，但提出了贪心的O(N log N)策略，通过将最不确定的文档放在信息量最大的位置来达到可比性能。

Result: 在知识密集型NLP任务中，该方法使用比随机排列基线少65%的语言模型查询来识别相关文档，显著降低计算成本且无需模型重新训练。

Conclusion: 这项工作表明，固有的LLM偏见可以从负担转化为资产，用于实现高效的推理时优化。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit a strong position bias in multi-document
contexts, systematically prioritizing information based on location rather than
relevance. While existing approaches treat this bias as noise to be mitigated,
we introduce Gold Panning Bandits, a framework that leverages position bias as
a diagnostic signal: by reordering documents and observing shifts in the
model's responses, we can efficiently identify the most relevant content. We
frame the problem of choosing reorderings as a bipartite matching problem.
While an optimal assignment can be computed at each iteration with the
Hungarian algorithm in $O(N^3)$ time, we propose a greedy $O(N \log N)$
strategy that achieves comparable performance by prioritizing the placement of
the most uncertain documents in the most informative positions. Our approach
identifies relevant documents using up to 65\% fewer language model queries
than random permutation baselines on knowledge-intensive NLP tasks,
substantially reducing computational cost without model retraining. This work
demonstrates that inherent LLM biases can be transformed from liabilities into
assets for efficient, inference-time optimization.

TL;DR: PromptGuard是一个用于孟加拉语仇恨言论分类的少样本框架，结合卡方统计分析和自适应多数投票机制，在BLP-2025 Task 1A任务中取得了67.61的micro-F1分数，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督方法需要大量标注数据，这对于低资源语言来说成本高昂，因此需要开发少样本学习方法。

Method: 使用卡方统计分析进行关键词提取，结合自适应多数投票机制进行决策，比较统计关键词选择与随机方法的效果。

Result: PromptGuard达到67.61的micro-F1分数，优于n-gram基线（60.75）和随机方法（14.65），卡方关键词在所有类别中表现最一致。

Conclusion: 卡方关键词提取提供了跨类别的持续改进，自适应投票机制在需要扩展分类轮次的模糊案例中表现优异。

Abstract: The BLP-2025 Task 1A requires Bengali hate speech classification into six
categories. Traditional supervised approaches need extensive labeled datasets
that are expensive for low-resource languages. We developed PromptGuard, a
few-shot framework combining chi-square statistical analysis for keyword
extraction with adaptive majority voting for decision-making. We explore
statistical keyword selection versus random approaches and adaptive voting
mechanisms that extend classification based on consensus quality. Chi-square
keywords provide consistent improvements across categories, while adaptive
voting benefits ambiguous cases requiring extended classification rounds.
PromptGuard achieves a micro-F1 of 67.61, outperforming n-gram baselines
(60.75) and random approaches (14.65). Ablation studies confirm
chi-square-based keywords show the most consistent impact across all
categories.

Motivation: 理解语言和嵌入模型如何编码语义关系对于模型可解释性和控制至关重要。现代高维文本表示缺乏直观的几何特性。

Method: 引入Rotor-Invariant Shift Estimation (RISE)，利用现代语言表示的流形结构，将语义转换表示为嵌入空间中的一致旋转操作。

Conclusion: 首次系统证明语篇级语义转换对应于多语言嵌入空间中的一致几何操作，在句子层面经验支持线性表示假说。

Abstract: Understanding how language and embedding models encode semantic relationships
is fundamental to model interpretability and control. While early word

''woman'' = ''queen''), modern high-dimensional text representations lack
straightforward interpretable geometric properties. We introduce
Rotor-Invariant Shift Estimation (RISE), a geometric approach that represents
semantic transformations as consistent rotational operations in embedding
space, leveraging the manifold structure of modern language representations.
RISE operations have the ability to operate across both languages and models
with high transfer of performance, suggesting the existence of analogous
cross-lingual geometric structure. We evaluate RISE across three embedding
models, three datasets, and seven morphologically diverse languages in five
major language groups. Our results demonstrate that RISE consistently maps
discourse-level semantic transformations with distinct grammatical features
(e.g., negation and conditionality) across languages and models. This work
provides the first systematic demonstration that discourse-level semantic
transformations correspond to consistent geometric operations in multilingual
embedding spaces, empirically supporting the Linear Representation Hypothesis
at the sentence level.

Result: 在多个基准测试和骨干模型上的实验表明，NG-Router持续优于单智能体和集成基线方法。

Conclusion: NG-Router为复杂营养健康任务提供了一种原则性的领域感知多智能体推理方法。

Abstract: Diet plays a central role in human health, and Nutrition Question Answering
(QA) offers a promising path toward personalized dietary guidance and the
prevention of diet-related chronic diseases. However, existing methods face two
fundamental challenges: the limited reasoning capacity of single-agent systems
and the complexity of designing effective multi-agent architectures, as well as
contextual overload that hinders accurate decision-making. We introduce
Nutritional-Graph Router (NG-Router), a novel framework that formulates
nutritional QA as a supervised, knowledge-graph-guided multi-agent
collaboration problem. NG-Router integrates agent nodes into heterogeneous
knowledge graphs and employs a graph neural network to learn task-aware routing
distributions over agents, leveraging soft supervision derived from empirical
agent performance. To further address contextual overload, we propose a
gradient-based subgraph retrieval mechanism that identifies salient evidence
during training, thereby enhancing multi-hop and relational reasoning.
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and backbone models
demonstrate that NG-Router consistently outperforms both single-agent and
ensemble baselines, offering a principled approach to domain-aware multi-agent
reasoning for complex nutritional health tasks.

Motivation: 当前叙事理解评估存在显著不足，许多重要方面被忽视或与现有指标不匹配，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 开发了理论驱动的叙事理解任务分类法，并对78个现有基准进行了系统性调查和分析。

Result: 发现只有27%的叙事任务被现有基准充分覆盖，叙事事件、风格、视角和启示等关键方面几乎缺失，主观和视角性方面的评估尤其不足。

Conclusion: 需要开发新的评估基准来覆盖被忽视的叙事理解方面，特别是主观和视角性维度，该分类法和调查方法对测试LLM叙事理解能力具有重要价值。

Abstract: We present NarraBench, a theory-informed taxonomy of narrative-understanding
tasks, as well as an associated survey of 78 existing benchmarks in the area.
We find significant need for new evaluations covering aspects of narrative
understanding that are either overlooked in current work or are poorly aligned
with existing metrics. Specifically, we estimate that only 27% of narrative
tasks are well captured by existing benchmarks, and we note that some areas --
including narrative events, style, perspective, and revelation -- are nearly
absent from current evaluations. We also note the need for increased
development of benchmarks capable of assessing constitutively subjective and
perspectival aspects of narrative, that is, aspects for which there is
generally no single correct answer. Our taxonomy, survey, and methodology are
of value to NLP researchers seeking to test LLM narrative understanding.

TL;DR: CoBia是一个轻量级对抗攻击套件，通过在对话中植入偏见声明来测试LLM是否能从偏见中恢复并拒绝后续偏见问题，揭示了LLM中根深蒂固的偏见问题。


<details>

Motivation: 尽管LLM通过了标准安全检查，但在对话中仍会表现出有害行为，如表达种族主义观点。需要系统性地分析LLM在哪些条件下会偏离规范或道德行为。

Method: 创建构造对话，让模型说出关于社会群体的偏见声明，然后评估模型是否能从虚构的偏见声明中恢复并拒绝偏见的后续问题。使用基于LLM的偏见指标进行评估，并与人类判断进行比较。

Result: 有目的构建的对话可靠地揭示了偏见放大，LLM在对话中经常无法拒绝偏见的后续问题。

Conclusion: 这种压力测试突显了通过互动可以浮现的深层嵌入偏见，表明需要更严格的偏见检测和缓解方法。

Abstract: Improvements in model construction, including fortified safety guardrails,
allow Large language models (LLMs) to increasingly pass standard safety checks.
However, LLMs sometimes slip into revealing harmful behavior, such as
expressing racist viewpoints, during conversations. To analyze this
systematically, we introduce CoBia, a suite of lightweight adversarial attacks
that allow us to refine the scope of conditions under which LLMs depart from
normative or ethical behavior in conversations. CoBia creates a constructed
conversation where the model utters a biased claim about a social group. We
then evaluate whether the model can recover from the fabricated bias claim and
reject biased follow-up questions. We evaluate 11 open-source as well as
proprietary LLMs for their outputs related to six socio-demographic categories
that are relevant to individual safety and fair treatment, i.e., gender, race,
religion, nationality, sex orientation, and others. Our evaluation is based on
established LLM-based bias metrics, and we compare the results against human
judgments to scope out the LLMs' reliability and alignment. The results suggest
that purposefully constructed conversations reliably reveal bias amplification
and that LLMs often fail to reject biased follow-up questions during dialogue.
This form of stress-testing highlights deeply embedded biases that can be
surfaced through interaction. Code and artifacts are available at

*Vishal Anand,Milad Alshomary,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: iBERT是一个可解释的BERT编码器，通过稀疏非负混合的上下文无关感知向量来表示输入标记，实现可解释和可控的嵌入表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够模块化并暴露语言中判别性线索（如风格和语义结构）的嵌入表示，使嵌入具有内在可解释性和可控性。

Method: 使用k个上下文无关的感知向量，每个输入标记表示为这些感知向量的稀疏非负混合，可以池化为句子嵌入或直接在标记级别使用。

Result: 在STEL基准测试中，风格表示效果比SBERT基线提高约8个点，在作者验证任务上保持竞争力，能够将特定风格属性（如表情符号使用、正式性、拼写错误）分配给特定的感知向量。

Conclusion: iBERT的结构模块化能够可解释地分解数据中的判别信号，即使监督混合了风格和语义因素也能实现泛化，不限于风格建模。

Abstract: We present iBERT (interpretable-BERT), an encoder to produce inherently
interpretable and controllable embeddings - designed to modularize and expose
the discriminative cues present in language, such as stylistic and semantic
structure. Each input token is represented as a sparse, non-negative mixture
over k context-independent sense vectors, which can be pooled into sentence
embeddings or used directly at the token level. This enables modular control
over representation, before any decoding or downstream use.
  To demonstrate our model's interpretability, we evaluate it on a suite of
style-focused tasks. On the STEL benchmark, it improves style representation
effectiveness by ~8 points over SBERT-style baselines, while maintaining
competitive performance on authorship verification. Because each embedding is a
structured composition of interpretable senses, we highlight how specific style
attributes - such as emoji use, formality, or misspelling can be assigned to
specific sense vectors. While our experiments center on style, iBERT is not
limited to stylistic modeling. Its structural modularity is designed to
interpretably decompose whichever discriminative signals are present in the
data - enabling generalization even when supervision blends stylistic and
semantic factors.

### [240] [DELTA: Dynamic Layer-Aware Token Attention for Efficient Long-Context Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09883)
*Hossein Entezari Zarch,Lei Gao,Chaoyi Jiang,Murali Annavarm*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DELTA是一种无需训练的稀疏注意力机制，通过将Transformer层分为三组（全注意力层、选择层、稀疏注意力层）来减少推理计算成本，同时保持模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在解码过程中需要关注整个增长序列，计算成本高昂。现有的稀疏注意力方法虽然减少计算，但在推理任务上存在严重的精度下降问题。

Method: 将Transformer层分为初始全注意力层、选择层（通过聚合头级注意力分数识别重要token）和稀疏注意力层（仅关注选定子集），保留完整的KV缓存以保证精度。

Result: 在AIME和GPQA-Diamond等推理基准测试中，DELTA达到或超过全注意力的精度，同时将关注token数量减少5倍，实现1.5倍的端到端加速。

Conclusion: 选择性重用中间注意力图为高效长上下文推理提供了稳健路径。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance on
challenging benchmarks by generating long chains of intermediate steps, but
their inference cost is dominated by decoding, where each new token must attend
to the entire growing sequence. Existing sparse attention methods reduce
computation by pruning the key-value (KV) cache, yet they suffer from severe
accuracy degradation on reasoning tasks due to cumulative selection errors and
the dynamic importance of tokens over long derivations. We present
\textbf{DELTA}, a training-free sparse attention mechanism that achieves
computational efficiency without sacrificing model accuracy. DELTA partitions
transformer layers into three groups: initial layers that use full attention, a
small set of \emph{selection layers} that identify salient tokens via
aggregated head-level attention scores, and subsequent \emph{sparse-attention
layers} that attend only to the selected subset. This design preserves the full
KV cache in GPU memory for accuracy, while avoiding expensive full-attention
computation over many layers. On reasoning benchmarks such as AIME and
GPQA-Diamond, DELTA matches or surpasses full attention in accuracy, while
reducing the number of attended tokens by up to $5\times$ and delivering
$1.5\times$ end-to-end speedup. Our results show that selective reuse of
intermediate attention maps offers a robust path toward efficient long-context
reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 扩散语言模型(dLLMs)在知识注入方面优于自回归语言模型(arLLMs)，无需数据增强即可在正向和反向问答中表现良好，并启发了新的掩码微调方法提升arLLMs的数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究预训练扩散语言模型(dLLMs)是否能在微调阶段保持其相对于自回归语言模型(arLLMs)的优势，特别是在知识注入和避免"反转诅咒"方面。

Method: 在三个不同数据集上对arLLMs和dLLMs进行微调，使用正向和反向风格问答来评估知识泛化和反转诅咒问题，并基于dLLMs的表现提出新的掩码微调范式。

Result: dLLMs无需数据增强即可在正向和反向问答中达到高准确率，而arLLMs严重依赖数据增强且仅当信息顺序匹配问答风格时有效。提出的掩码微调方法显著提升了arLLMs的数据效率。

Conclusion: dLLMs在知识注入方面具有显著优势，无需复杂的数据增强策略，其表现启发了改进arLLMs微调效率的新方法，成功缩小了两者之间的性能差距。

Abstract: Despite autoregressive large language models (arLLMs) being the current
dominant paradigm in language modeling, they resist knowledge injection via
fine-tuning due to inherent shortcomings such as the "reversal curse" -- the
challenge of answering questions that reverse the original information order in
the training sample. Masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are rapidly
emerging as a powerful alternative to the arLLM paradigm, with evidence of
better data efficiency and free of the "reversal curse" in pre-training.
However, it is unknown whether these advantages extend to the post-training
phase, i.e. whether pre-trained dLLMs can easily acquire new knowledge through
fine-tuning. On three diverse datasets, we fine-tune arLLMs and dLLMs,
evaluating them with forward and backward style Question Answering (QA) to
probe knowledge generalization and the reversal curse. Our results confirm that
arLLMs critically rely on extensive data augmentation via paraphrases for QA
generalization, and paraphrases are only effective when their information order
matches the QA style. Conversely, dLLMs achieve high accuracies on both forward
and backward QAs without paraphrases; adding paraphrases yields only marginal
gains. Lastly, inspired by the dLLM's performance, we introduce a novel masked
fine-tuning paradigm for knowledge injection into pre-trained arLLMs. This
proposed method successfully and drastically improves the data efficiency of
arLLM fine-tuning, effectively closing the performance gap with dLLMs.

### [242] [Abductive Preference Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09887)
*Yijin Ni,Peng Qi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种反绎偏好学习方法，通过反转传统条件学习来改善大语言模型对反事实提示的敏感性，解决了现有偏好学习方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前沿大语言模型即使经过RLHF和DPO对齐后仍然存在过度自信的问题，无法正确处理反事实提示，这源于现有偏好学习只关注为给定提示选择正确回答，而忽略了应该改变回答的反事实提示。

Method: 提出了反绎偏好学习微调范式，通过反转传统条件来学习给定回答下的提示偏好，构建了基于HaluEval QA基准的反绎数据集，实现了反绎DPO及其变体DPOP。

Result: 多任务DPOP在反绎数据集上将回答选择准确率从90.0%提升到99.5%，提示辨别准确率从54.7%提升到85.0%，在AlpacaEval上的胜率从5.26%提升到6.17%。

Conclusion: 反绎偏好学习在保持传统偏好优化优势的同时，解决了被忽视的反事实提示挑战，提高了模型对提示差异的敏感性。

Abstract: Frontier large language models such as GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet remain prone
to overconfidence even after alignment through Reinforcement Learning with
Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). For instance,
they tend to offer the same conservative answer "No" to both questions "Can I
eat the [food / potato chips] that has been left out overnight?" despite the
latter requiring no refridgeration for safe consumption. We find that this
failure is potentially attributed to a limitation of existing preference
learning: it emphasizes selecting the correct response for a given prompt,
while neglecting counterfactual prompts that should alter the response.
  To address this limitation, we propose abductive preference learning, a
fine-tuning paradigm that reverses the conventional conditioning by learning
preferences over prompts given a response. To validate this idea, we construct
an abductive dataset derived from the HaluEval QA benchmark with 1,001 entries,
implementing abductive DPO and its variant DPOP. Experiments reveal
complementary strengths: standard methods improve response selection, abductive
methods improve prompt discrimination, while a multitask objective unifies
both. On the abductive dataset, multitask DPOP boosts accuracy from $90.0\%$ to
$99.5\%$ in response selection and $54.7\%$ to $85.0\%$ in prompt
discrimination, with qualitative evidence highlighting improved sensitivity to
prompt differences. Finally, evaluation on AlpacaEval shows multitask DPOP
improves win rate (from $5.26\%$ to $6.17\%$), confirming that abductive
preference learning preserves the benefits of conventional preference
optimization while addressing the overlooked challenge of counterfactual
prompts.

Conclusion: HIPPD通过模拟人脑的层次信息处理机制，有效解决了性格检测中的上下文捕捉和特征提取问题，取得了优异性能。

Abstract: Personality detection from text aims to infer an individual's personality
traits based on linguistic patterns. However, existing machine learning
approaches often struggle to capture contextual information spanning multiple
posts and tend to fall short in extracting representative and robust features
in semantically sparse environments. This paper presents HIPPD, a
brain-inspired framework for personality detection that emulates the
hierarchical information processing of the human brain. HIPPD utilises a large
language model to simulate the cerebral cortex, enabling global semantic
reasoning and deep feature abstraction. A dynamic memory module, modelled after
the prefrontal cortex, performs adaptive gating and selective retention of
critical features, with all adjustments driven by dopaminergic prediction error
feedback. Subsequently, a set of specialised lightweight models, emulating the
basal ganglia, are dynamically routed via a strict winner-takes-all mechanism
to capture the personality-related patterns they are most proficient at
recognising. Extensive experiments on the Kaggle and Pandora datasets
demonstrate that HIPPD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Alignment training has tradeoffs: it helps language models (LMs) gain in
reasoning and instruction following but might lose out on skills such as
creativity and calibration, where unaligned base models are better at. We aim
to make the best of both worlds through model collaboration, where different
models in the training pipeline collaborate and complement each other. Since LM
responses feature interleaving skills that favor different models, we propose
Switch Generation, where pretrained and aligned model versions take turns to
``speak'' in a response sequence. Specifically, we train a switcher LM by
learning from outcomes of choosing different models to generate the next
segment across diverse queries and contexts. At inference time, the switcher LM
guides different model checkpoints to dynamically generate the next segment
where their strengths are most needed. Extensive experiments with 8 model
collaboration baselines and 18 datasets show that 1) model collaboration
consistently outperforms individual models on 16 out of 18 tasks, and 2) Switch
Generation further outperforms baselines by 12.9% on average. Further analysis
reveals that Switch Generation discovers compositional skills to solve problems
where individual models struggle and generalizes to unseen models and tasks,
reusing and repurposing by-products in expensive model training pipelines that
are otherwise discarded.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型能生成流畅摘要，但经常产生不忠实内容（幻觉）。现有缓解策略无法完全解决LLM生成摘要中的多样化错误。

Method: 使用多种LLM自动生成训练集摘要，用GPT-4o进行span级幻觉标注，基于标注数据采用梯度上升、unlikelihood训练和任务向量否定三种微调方法。

Result: 实验结果显示所有三种方法都能有效利用span级标注提升忠实度，其中unlikelihood训练效果最好。

Conclusion: 基于span级标注的微调策略能显著改善LLM生成摘要的忠实度，为减少幻觉提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Abstractive summarization using large language models (LLMs) has become an
essential tool for condensing information. However, despite their ability to
generate fluent summaries, these models sometimes produce unfaithful summaries,
introducing hallucinations at the word, phrase, or concept level. Existing
mitigation strategies, such as post-processing corrections or contrastive
learning with synthetically generated negative samples, fail to fully address
the diverse errors that can occur in LLM-generated summaries. In this paper, we
investigate fine-tuning strategies to reduce the occurrence of unfaithful spans
in generated summaries. First, we automatically generate summaries for the set
of source documents in the training set with a variety of LLMs and then use
GPT-4o to annotate any hallucinations it detects at the span-level. Leveraging
these annotations, we fine-tune LLMs with both hallucination-free summaries and
annotated unfaithful spans to enhance model faithfulness. In this paper, we
introduce a new dataset that contains both faithful and unfaithful summaries
with span-level labels and we evaluate three techniques to fine-tuning a LLM to
improve the faithfulness of the resulting summarization: gradient ascent,
unlikelihood training, and task vector negation. Experimental results show that
all three approaches successfully leverage span-level annotations to improve
faithfulness, with unlikelihood training being the most effective.

TL;DR: SHIELD是一个仇恨表情包检测框架，通过建模预设上下文和检测虚假声明来识别仇恨表情包，在多个数据集和指标上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前仇恨表情包检测方法主要依赖预训练语言模型，但较少关注仇恨表情包的本质特征。基于哲学和心理学见解，认为仇恨表情包具有两个关键特征：预设上下文和虚假声明表达。

Method: 开发PCM模块建模跨模态的上下文信息，引入FACT模块整合外部知识并利用跨模态参考图检测虚假声明，结合两者构建SHIELD框架。

Result: 广泛实验表明SHIELD在多个数据集和指标上优于最先进方法，并在其他任务如假新闻检测中表现出通用性。

Conclusion: SHIELD通过捕捉仇恨表情包的本质特征，实现了有效的仇恨内容检测，具有很好的泛化能力。

Abstract: While memes are often humorous, they are frequently used to disseminate hate,
causing serious harm to individuals and society. Current approaches to hateful
meme detection mainly rely on pre-trained language models. However, less focus
has been dedicated to \textit{what make a meme hateful}. Drawing on insights
from philosophy and psychology, we argue that hateful memes are characterized
by two essential features: a \textbf{presupposed context} and the expression of
\textbf{false claims}. To capture presupposed context, we develop \textbf{PCM}
for modeling contextual information across modalities. To detect false claims,
we introduce the \textbf{FACT} module, which integrates external knowledge and
harnesses cross-modal reference graphs. By combining PCM and FACT, we introduce
\textbf{\textsf{SHIELD}}, a hateful meme detection framework designed to
capture the fundamental nature of hate. Extensive experiments show that SHIELD
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across datasets and metrics, while
demonstrating versatility on other tasks, such as fake news detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准分词评估指标fertility只关注压缩效率，但掩盖了词汇表在不同语言和领域间的分配公平性问题。

Method: 分析6个广泛使用的分词器在7种语言和2个领域中的表现，提出STRR指标来衡量单词被保留为单个令牌的比例。

Result: 发现英语的fertility稳定，中文的fertility较高，领域敏感性低；STRR显示英语被系统优先，中文支持良好，印地语存在碎片化。

Conclusion: STRR补充了fertility指标，为设计更公平的多语言分词器提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Tokenization is a crucial but under-evaluated step in large language models
(LLMs). The standard metric, fertility (the average number of tokens per word),
captures compression efficiency but obscures how vocabularies are allocated
across languages and domains. We analyze six widely used tokenizers across
seven languages and two domains, finding stable fertility for English, high
fertility for Chinese, and little domain sensitivity. To address fertility's
blind spots, we propose the Single Token Retention Rate (STRR), which measures
the proportion of words preserved as single tokens. STRR reveals systematic
prioritization of English, strong support for Chinese, and fragmentation in
Hindi, offering an interpretable view of cross-lingual fairness. Our results
show that STRR complements fertility and provides practical guidance for
designing more equitable multilingual tokenizers.

Abstract: Deliberative tree search is a cornerstone of modern Large Language Model
(LLM) research, driving the pivot from brute-force scaling toward algorithmic
efficiency. This single paradigm unifies two critical frontiers:
\textbf{Test-Time Scaling (TTS)}, which deploys on-demand computation to solve
hard problems, and \textbf{Self-Improvement}, which uses search-generated data
to durably enhance model parameters. However, this burgeoning field is
fragmented and lacks a common formalism, particularly concerning the ambiguous
role of the reward signal -- is it a transient heuristic or a durable learning
target? This paper resolves this ambiguity by introducing a unified framework
that deconstructs search algorithms into three core components: the
\emph{Search Mechanism}, \emph{Reward Formulation}, and \emph{Transition
Function}. We establish a formal distinction between transient \textbf{Search
Guidance} for TTS and durable \textbf{Parametric Reward Modeling} for
Self-Improvement. Building on this formalism, we introduce a component-centric
taxonomy, synthesize the state-of-the-art, and chart a research roadmap toward
more systematic progress in creating autonomous, self-improving agents.

Method: 在公共博物馆进行人类研究（n=452），调查流畅性和充分性错误如何影响双语和非双语用户在休闲使用中对机器翻译的依赖。

Result: 非双语用户由于缺乏评估策略和替代方案而经常过度依赖机器翻译，但体验错误影响会促使用户重新评估未来的依赖程度。

Conclusion: 机器翻译评估和NLP解释技术不仅需要提高机器翻译质量，还需要促进用户对机器翻译的素养。

Abstract: As Machine Translation (MT) becomes increasingly commonplace, understanding
how the general public perceives and relies on imperfect MT is crucial for
contextualizing MT research in real-world applications. We present a human
study conducted in a public museum (n=452), investigating how fluency and
adequacy errors impact bilingual and non-bilingual users' reliance on MT during
casual use. Our findings reveal that non-bilingual users often over-rely on MT
due to a lack of evaluation strategies and alternatives, while experiencing the
impact of errors can prompt users to reassess future reliance. This highlights
the need for MT evaluation and NLP explanation techniques to promote not only
MT quality, but also MT literacy among its users.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出在语音到单元翻译(S2UT)模型中引入多令牌预测(MTP)损失，通过在每个位置预测多个后续令牌来增强语义密度和信息表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音到语音翻译方法使用语音令牌作为中间表示，但单个令牌语义密度不足，需要多个令牌才能表达完整语义单元。

Method: 提出MTP-S2UT损失，将多令牌预测损失应用到CTC损失计算的隐藏表示层，使信息丰富过程提前到中间层。

Result: 实验表明所有MTP损失变体都能持续提高S2UT翻译质量，其中MTP-S2UT表现最佳。

Conclusion: 在中间层应用多令牌预测损失可以更早、更有效地增强隐藏表示，提升语音到单元翻译性能。

Abstract: Current direct speech-to-speech translation methods predominantly employ
speech tokens as intermediate representations. However, a single speech token
is not dense in semantics, so we generally need multiple tokens to express a
complete semantic unit. To address this limitation, we introduce multi-token
prediction (MTP) loss into speech-to-unit translation (S2UT) models, enabling
models to predict multiple subsequent tokens at each position, thereby
capturing more complete semantics and enhancing information density per
position. Initial MTP implementations apply the loss at the final layer, which
improves output representation but initiates information enrichment too late.
We hypothesize that advancing the information enrichment process to
intermediate layers can achieve earlier and more effective enhancement of
hidden representation. Consequently, we propose MTP-S2UT loss, applying MTP
loss to hidden representation where CTC loss is computed. Experiments
demonstrate that all MTP loss variants consistently improve the quality of S2UT
translation, with MTP-S2UT achieving the best performance.

*Shu Zhao,Tan Yu,Anbang Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出ExpandSearch方法，通过强化学习训练LLM搜索代理进行查询扩展，同时引入预训练压缩器模型帮助理解检索文档，在7个问答基准测试中平均提升4.4%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理增强搜索代理在复杂多跳问答任务上表现不佳，主要受限于推理和搜索能力不足，难以处理复杂复合查询。

Method: 使用强化学习训练LLM搜索代理，每轮生成多个查询变体并行搜索；引入预训练压缩器模型帮助理解检索文档，让搜索代理专注于查询生成以提高检索召回率。

Result: 在7个问答基准测试中，ExpandSearch相比最先进基线平均提升4.4%准确率，在多跳推理任务上表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 即使使用小规模3B参数的LLM，结合压缩器模型辅助，也能展现出强大的查询扩展能力，在多跳问答基准上达到最先进水平。

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented search agents, such as Search-R1, are trained to reason,
search, and generate the final answer iteratively. Nevertheless, due to their
limited capabilities in reasoning and search, their performance on multi-hop QA
benchmarks remains far from satisfactory. To handle complex or compound
queries, we train an LLM-based search agent with the native capability of query
expansion through reinforcement learning. In each turn, our search agent
proposes several query variants, which are searched simultaneously to cover
more relevant information. Meanwhile, given limited post-training data and
computing resources, it is very challenging for a search agent to master
multiple tasks, including query generation, retrieved information
understanding, and answer generation. Therefore, we propose incorporating a
pre-trained squeezer model that helps the search agent understand the retrieved
documents, allowing the search agent to focus on query generation for high
retrieval recall. With the assistance of the squeezer model, we discover that
even a small-scale 3B LLM can demonstrate a strong capability of query
expansion and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the multi-hop QA benchmarks.
To be specific, our experiments across seven question-answering benchmarks
demonstrate that our method, named ExpandSearch, achieves an average
improvement of 4.4% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with strong gains
on multi-hop reasoning tasks requiring diverse evidence aggregation.

*Yuyi Huang,Runzhe Zhan,Lidia S. Chao,Ailin Tao,Derek F. Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文识别了大型语言模型在长链思维推理中的路径漂移漏洞，即推理轨迹会偏离安全对齐路径，并提出诱导框架和防御策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs通过RLHF等技术实现了初步安全对齐，但在复杂的长链推理任务中，推理轨迹仍可能偏离安全路径，产生违反安全约束的内容，这种路径漂移现象尚未被充分研究。

Method: 通过实证分析识别三种路径漂移行为触发因素，提出包含认知负荷放大、自我角色启动和条件链劫持的三阶段路径漂移诱导框架，并设计包含角色归因修正和元认知反思的路径级防御策略。

Result: 研究发现三种行为触发因素能独立降低拒绝率，组合使用时效果更显著，证明了长链推理中轨迹级对齐监督的必要性。

Conclusion: 长链推理需要超越词元级对齐的轨迹级对齐监督，路径漂移现象揭示了当前安全对齐技术在复杂推理任务中的局限性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for complex
reasoning tasks, Long Chain-of-Thought (Long-CoT) prompting has emerged as a
key paradigm for structured inference. Despite early-stage safeguards enabled
by alignment techniques such as RLHF, we identify a previously underexplored
vulnerability: reasoning trajectories in Long-CoT models can drift from aligned
paths, resulting in content that violates safety constraints. We term this
phenomenon Path Drift. Through empirical analysis, we uncover three behavioral
triggers of Path Drift: (1) first-person commitments that induce goal-driven
reasoning that delays refusal signals; (2) ethical evaporation, where
surface-level disclaimers bypass alignment checkpoints; (3) condition chain
escalation, where layered cues progressively steer models toward unsafe
completions. Building on these insights, we introduce a three-stage Path Drift
Induction Framework comprising cognitive load amplification, self-role priming,
and condition chain hijacking. Each stage independently reduces refusal rates,
while their combination further compounds the effect. To mitigate these risks,
we propose a path-level defense strategy incorporating role attribution
correction and metacognitive reflection (reflective safety cues). Our findings
highlight the need for trajectory-level alignment oversight in long-form
reasoning beyond token-level alignment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探索了在医疗文本分类任务中，轻量级模型DistilBERT通过标准交叉熵损失可以达到与BERT base相当的性能，同时参数更少，更适合医疗部署环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗环境中部署存在成本、延迟和隐私限制，需要寻找轻量级但有效的解决方案。

Method: 使用医疗摘要语料库，在固定分词器、序列长度、优化器和调度的情况下，对BERT base和DistilBERT进行微调，比较标准交叉熵、类别加权交叉熵和焦点损失三种目标函数。

Result: DistilBERT配合标准交叉熵损失在测试集上取得了最佳平衡效果，参数数量远少于BERT base，同时报告了准确率、宏F1和加权F1指标。

Conclusion: 建议的实践默认方案：从紧凑编码器和交叉熵开始，然后添加校准和任务特定检查，最后才考虑使用更重的模型。

Abstract: Large language models work well for many NLP tasks, but they are hard to
deploy in health settings with strict cost, latency, and privacy limits. We
revisit a lightweight recipe for medical abstract classification and ask how
far compact encoders can go under a controlled budget. Using the public medical
abstracts corpus, we finetune BERT base and DistilBERT with three objectives
standard cross-entropy, class weighted cross entropy, and focal loss keeping
tokenizer, sequence length, optimizer, and schedule fixed. DistilBERT with
plain cross-entropy gives the best balance on the test set while using far
fewer parameters than BERT base. We report accuracy, Macro F1, and Weighted F1,
release the evaluation code, and include confusion analyses to make error
patterns clear. Our results suggest a practical default: start with a compact
encoder and cross-entropy, then add calibration and task-specific checks before
moving to heavier models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了HUME框架来测量文本嵌入任务中的人类表现，填补了现有评估框架缺乏可靠人类性能基准的空白，使模型性能评估更具可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有嵌入模型评估框架（如MTEB）缺乏可靠的人类性能估计，限制了模型得分的可解释性。需要建立人类基准来更好地理解模型在语义理解任务中的表现。

Method: 引入HUME框架，在16个MTEB数据集上测量人类表现，涵盖重排序、分类、聚类和语义文本相似性任务，涉及高资源和低资源语言。

Result: 人类平均表现达到77.6%，而最佳嵌入模型为80.1%。模型在某些数据集上接近上限性能，但在其他数据集上表现不佳，特别是在低资源语言中。

Conclusion: 提供了人类性能基准和任务难度模式洞察，建立了可扩展的评估框架，有助于更准确地解释模型性能并指导模型和基准测试的开发。

Abstract: Comparing human and model performance offers a valuable perspective for
understanding the strengths and limitations of embedding models, highlighting
where they succeed and where they fail to capture meaning and nuance. However,
such comparisons are rarely made, as human performance on embedding tasks is
difficult to measure. To fill this gap, we introduce HUME: Human Evaluation
Framework for Text Embeddings. While frameworks like MTEB provide broad model
evaluation, they lack reliable estimates of human performance, limiting the
interpretability of model scores. We measure human performance across 16 MTEB
datasets spanning reranking, classification, clustering, and semantic textual
similarity across linguistically diverse high- and low-resource languages.
Humans achieve an average performance of 77.6% compared to 80.1% for the best
embedding model, although variation is substantial: models reach near-ceiling
performance on some datasets while struggling on others, suggesting dataset
issues and revealing shortcomings in low-resource languages. We provide human
performance baselines, insight into task difficulty patterns, and an extensible
evaluation framework that enables a more meaningful interpretation of the model
and informs the development of both models and benchmarks. Our code, dataset,
and leaderboard are publicly available at

### [255] [CLMN: Concept based Language Models via Neural Symbolic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10063)
*Yibo Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLMN是一个神经符号框架，通过连续可读的概念嵌入和模糊逻辑推理，在保持性能的同时提升NLP模型的可解释性，特别是在医疗和金融领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在NLP中取得了进展，但可解释性仍然有限，尤其是在医疗和金融等关键领域。现有的概念瓶颈模型要么使用二元激活损害文本表示，要么使用潜在概念削弱语义，且很少建模动态概念交互。

Method: 提出概念语言模型网络(CLMN)，将概念表示为连续、人类可读的嵌入，应用模糊逻辑推理学习自适应交互规则，描述概念如何相互影响及影响最终决策。模型通过概念感知表示增强原始文本特征，并自动推导可解释的逻辑规则。

Result: 在多个数据集和预训练语言模型上，CLMN比现有基于概念的方法实现了更高的准确性，同时提高了解释质量。

Conclusion: 在统一概念空间中整合神经表示与符号推理可以产生实用、透明的NLP系统。

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced NLP, but interpretability remains limited,
especially in healthcare and finance. Concept bottleneck models tie predictions
to human concepts in vision, but NLP versions either use binary activations
that harm text representations or latent concepts that weaken semantics, and
they rarely model dynamic concept interactions such as negation and context. We
introduce the Concept Language Model Network (CLMN), a neural-symbolic
framework that keeps both performance and interpretability. CLMN represents
concepts as continuous, human-readable embeddings and applies fuzzy-logic
reasoning to learn adaptive interaction rules that state how concepts affect
each other and the final decision. The model augments original text features
with concept-aware representations and automatically induces interpretable
logic rules. Across multiple datasets and pre-trained language models, CLMN
achieves higher accuracy than existing concept-based methods while improving
explanation quality. These results show that integrating neural representations
with symbolic reasoning in a unified concept space can yield practical,
transparent NLP systems.

TL;DR: Unilaw-R1是一个专为法律推理设计的7B参数大语言模型，通过两阶段训练策略显著提升复杂法律推理能力，在权威基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理型大语言模型在法律领域能力未被充分探索，法律AI面临法律知识不足、推理逻辑不可靠和业务泛化能力弱三大挑战。

Method: 构建包含17K高质量思维链样本的数据集Unilaw-R1-Data，采用监督微调(SFT)和强化学习(RL)的两阶段训练策略。

Result: Unilaw-R1在权威基准测试中超越所有同规模模型，与更大的DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B性能相当(54.9%)，在LawBench和LexEval上平均超过Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct 6.6%。

Conclusion: Unilaw-R1证明了轻量级模型通过专门训练可以在法律推理领域取得优异表现，为法律AI应用提供了可部署的解决方案。

Abstract: Reasoning-focused large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving across
various domains, yet their capabilities in handling complex legal problems
remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce Unilaw-R1, a large language
model tailored for legal reasoning. With a lightweight 7-billion parameter
scale, Unilaw-R1 significantly reduces deployment cost while effectively
tackling three core challenges in the legal domain: insufficient legal
knowledge, unreliable reasoning logic, and weak business generalization. To
address these issues, we first construct Unilaw-R1-Data, a high-quality dataset
containing 17K distilled and screened chain-of-thought (CoT) samples. Based on
this, we adopt a two-stage training strategy combining Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), which significantly boosts the
performance on complex legal reasoning tasks and supports interpretable
decision-making in legal AI applications. To assess legal reasoning ability, we
also introduce Unilaw-R1-Eval, a dedicated benchmark designed to evaluate
models across single- and multi-choice legal tasks. Unilaw-R1 demonstrates
strong results on authoritative benchmarks, outperforming all models of similar
scale and achieving performance on par with the much larger
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B (54.9%). Following domain-specific training, it
also showed significant gains on LawBench and LexEval, exceeding
Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct (46.6%) by an average margin of 6.6%.

*Wenqing Wang,Muhammad Asif Ali,Ali Shoker,Ruohan Yang,Junyang Chen,Ying Sha,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A-IPO是一种新的偏好优化方法，通过显式建模用户提示背后的潜在意图，将意图-响应相似性纳入奖励函数，从而更好地对齐用户意图并提高对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐方法（如DPO）往往默认多数观点，忽略了少数意见，且未能捕捉提示中的潜在用户意图。人类偏好具有多样性和动态性，受地区、文化和社会因素影响。

Method: A-IPO引入意图模块推断用户提示背后的潜在意图，并将推断的意图显式纳入奖励函数，通过意图-响应相似性项增加偏好边际，实现更清晰的偏好分离。

Result: 在三个基准测试中显著优于现有基线：Real-pref上胜率提升24.8%，意图一致性提升45.6%；Attack-pref上响应相似性提升38.6%，防御成功率提升52.2%；GlobalOpinionQA-Ext上意图一致性得分提升54.6%。

Conclusion: A-IPO通过显式建模多样化用户意图，促进了多元偏好优化，同时增强了偏好对齐的对抗鲁棒性，在多个关键指标上持续超越现有方法。

Abstract: Human preferences are diverse and dynamic, shaped by regional, cultural, and
social factors. Existing alignment methods like Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) and its variants often default to majority views, overlooking minority
opinions and failing to capture latent user intentions in prompts.
  To address these limitations, we introduce \underline{\textbf{A}}daptive
\textbf{\underline{I}}ntent-driven \textbf{\underline{P}}reference
\textbf{\underline{O}}ptimization (\textbf{A-IPO}). Specifically,A-IPO
introduces an intention module that infers the latent intent behind each user
prompt and explicitly incorporates this inferred intent into the reward
function, encouraging stronger alignment between the preferred model's
responses and the user's underlying intentions. We demonstrate, both
theoretically and empirically, that incorporating an intention--response
similarity term increases the preference margin (by a positive shift of
$\lambda\,\Delta\mathrm{sim}$ in the log-odds), resulting in clearer separation
between preferred and dispreferred responses compared to DPO.
  For evaluation, we introduce two new benchmarks, Real-pref, Attack-pref along
with an extended version of an existing dataset, GlobalOpinionQA-Ext, to assess
real-world and adversarial preference alignment.
  Through explicit modeling of diverse user intents,A-IPO facilitates
pluralistic preference optimization while simultaneously enhancing adversarial
robustness in preference alignment. Comprehensive empirical evaluation
demonstrates that A-IPO consistently surpasses existing baselines, yielding
substantial improvements across key metrics: up to +24.8 win-rate and +45.6
Response-Intention Consistency on Real-pref; up to +38.6 Response Similarity
and +52.2 Defense Success Rate on Attack-pref; and up to +54.6 Intention
Consistency Score on GlobalOpinionQA-Ext.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PerAugy的数据增强技术，通过跨轨迹混洗和摘要内容扰动来提升个性化摘要模型的性能，显著提高了用户编码器的准确性和个性化摘要效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化摘要面临训练数据稀缺的挑战，现有数据集如MS/CAS PENS缺乏目标摘要且主题转换多样性有限，无法支持端到端的监督学习。

Method: 开发了PerAugy数据增强技术，包括跨轨迹混洗和摘要内容扰动，用于增强个性化摘要训练数据的多样性。

Result: PerAugy显著提升了四种最先进用户编码器的准确性（最佳结果：AUC提升0.132），并使两个SOTA摘要框架的个性化程度平均提升61.2%。

Conclusion: 通过引入三个数据集多样性指标（TP、RTC、DegreeD）分析发现，增强的数据集多样性与用户编码器性能强相关，表明数据多样性是性能提升的关键因素。

Abstract: Document summarization enables efficient extraction of user-relevant content
but is inherently shaped by individual subjectivity, making it challenging to
identify subjective salient information in multifaceted documents. This
complexity underscores the necessity for personalized summarization. However,
training models for personalized summarization has so far been challenging,
particularly because diverse training data containing both user preference
history (i.e., click-skip trajectory) and expected (gold-reference) summaries
are scarce. The MS/CAS PENS dataset is a valuable resource but includes only
preference history without target summaries, preventing end-to-end supervised
learning, and its limited topic-transition diversity further restricts
generalization. To address this, we propose $\mathrm{PerAugy}$, a novel
cross-trajectory shuffling and summary-content perturbation based data
augmentation technique that significantly boosts the accuracy of four
state-of-the-art baseline (SOTA) user-encoders commonly used in personalized
summarization frameworks (best result: $\text{0.132}$$\uparrow$ w.r.t AUC). We
select two such SOTA summarizer frameworks as baselines and observe that when
augmented with their corresponding improved user-encoders, they consistently
show an increase in personalization (avg. boost: $\text{61.2\%}\uparrow$ w.r.t.
PSE-SU4 metric). As a post-hoc analysis of the role of induced diversity in the
augmented dataset by \peraugy, we introduce three dataset diversity metrics --
$\mathrm{TP}$, $\mathrm{RTC}$, and \degreed\ to quantify the induced diversity.
We find that $\mathrm{TP}$ and $\mathrm{DegreeD}$ strongly correlate with
user-encoder performance on the PerAugy-generated dataset across all accuracy
metrics, indicating that increased dataset diversity is a key factor driving
performance gains.

TL;DR: REFRAIN是一个无需训练的自适应推理停止框架，通过两阶段停止判别器和滑动窗口UCB多臂老虎机控制器来减少过度推理，在保持或提高准确性的同时显著降低token使用量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought推理虽然提升了大型语言模型的推理能力，但过度或冗余的推理会增加推理成本并导致错误结论，需要解决"何时停止推理"的问题。

Method: REFRAIN整合了两阶段停止判别器来识别反射性但冗余的推理，以及滑动窗口UCB多臂老虎机控制器来根据问题难度动态调整停止阈值，无需监督或微调。

Result: 在四个代表性基准测试和两个模型家族上，REFRAIN相比标准CoT提示减少了20-55%的token使用量，同时保持或提高了准确性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了"何时停止"作为测试时扩展的新实用维度，使模型能够进行适量而非过度的推理。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has driven recent gains of large language
models (LLMs) on reasoning-intensive tasks by externalizing intermediate steps.
However, excessive or redundant reasoning -- so-called overthinking -- can
increase inference costs and lead LLMs toward incorrect conclusions. In this
paper, we present REFRAIN ($\underline{REF}$lective-$\underline{R}$edundancy
for $\underline{A}$daptive $\underline{IN}$ference), a training-free framework
that adaptively determines when to stop reasoning to mitigate overthinking.
REFRAIN integrates a two-stage stop discriminator to identify reflective yet
redundant reasoning and a sliding-window Upper Confidence Bound (SW-UCB)
multi-armed bandit controller to dynamically adjust stopping thresholds
according to problem difficulty without supervision or fine-tuning. Across four
representative benchmarks and two model families, REFRAIN reduces token usage
by 20-55% while maintaining or improving accuracy compared to standard CoT
prompting. Extensive ablation and robustness analyses demonstrate its stability
across models, scorers, and prompt variations. In summary, our findings
highlight when-to-stop as a new and practical axis of test-time scaling --
enabling models to reason not just more, but just enough.

TL;DR: 提出了LinearRAG框架，通过构建无关系层次图（Tri-Graph）和两阶段检索策略，解决了传统GraphRAG方法在图构建和检索质量上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统在处理大规模非结构化语料时效果不佳，现有基于知识图谱的GraphRAG方法依赖不稳定且昂贵的关系抽取，导致构建的图谱噪声大、检索质量下降。

Method: 使用轻量级实体抽取和语义链接构建无关系层次图（Tri-Graph），采用两阶段检索策略：通过局部语义桥接激活相关实体，然后通过全局重要性聚合进行段落检索。

Result: 在四个数据集上的广泛实验表明，LinearRAG显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: LinearRAG提供了一种经济可靠的图构建方法，能够线性扩展语料规模且不消耗额外token，实现了可靠的图构建和精确的段落检索。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely used to mitigate
hallucinations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging external
knowledge. While effective for simple queries, traditional RAG systems struggle
with large-scale, unstructured corpora where information is fragmented. Recent
advances incorporate knowledge graphs to capture relational structures,
enabling more comprehensive retrieval for complex, multi-hop reasoning tasks.
However, existing graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) methods rely on unstable and
costly relation extraction for graph construction, often producing noisy graphs
with incorrect or inconsistent relations that degrade retrieval quality. In
this paper, we revisit the pipeline of existing GraphRAG systems and propose
LinearRAG (Linear Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation), an efficient
framework that enables reliable graph construction and precise passage
retrieval. Specifically, LinearRAG constructs a relation-free hierarchical
graph, termed Tri-Graph, using only lightweight entity extraction and semantic
linking, avoiding unstable relation modeling. This new paradigm of graph
construction scales linearly with corpus size and incurs no extra token
consumption, providing an economical and reliable indexing of the original
passages. For retrieval, LinearRAG adopts a two-stage strategy: (i) relevant
entity activation via local semantic bridging, followed by (ii) passage
retrieval through global importance aggregation. Extensive experiments on four
datasets demonstrate that LinearRAG significantly outperforms baseline models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决企业文档处理中大量结构相似内容的信息提取挑战，优化重复性提取任务的准确性与效率权衡。

Method: 结合OCR引擎与大型语言模型，实现三种提取范式（直接、替换、表格型），通过格式感知路由和智能策略选择处理异构文档流。

Result: 表格型提取方法在结构化文档中达到F1=1.0精度和0.97秒延迟，在图像输入中达到F1=0.997精度和0.6秒延迟，比多模态方法性能提升54倍。

Conclusion: 重复性文档处理任务可以通过结构感知方法选择，从计算负担转变为优化机会，为类似任务提供通用原则。

Abstract: Information extraction from copy-heavy documents, characterized by massive
volumes of structurally similar content, represents a critical yet understudied
challenge in enterprise document processing. We present a systematic framework
that strategically combines OCR engines with Large Language Models (LLMs) to
optimize the accuracy-efficiency trade-off inherent in repetitive document
extraction tasks. Unlike existing approaches that pursue universal solutions,
our method exploits document-specific characteristics through intelligent
strategy selection. We implement and evaluate 25 configurations across three
extraction paradigms (direct, replacement, and table-based) on identity
documents spanning four formats (PNG, DOCX, XLSX, PDF). Through table-based
extraction methods, our adaptive framework delivers outstanding results: F1=1.0
accuracy with 0.97s latency for structured documents, and F1=0.997 accuracy
with 0.6 s for challenging image inputs when integrated with PaddleOCR, all
while maintaining sub-second processing speeds. The 54 times performance
improvement compared with multimodal methods over naive approaches, coupled
with format-aware routing, enables processing of heterogeneous document streams
at production scale. Beyond the specific application to identity extraction,
this work establishes a general principle: the repetitive nature of copy-heavy
tasks can be transformed from a computational burden into an optimization
opportunity through structure-aware method selection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作主要关注偏见输出的出现时机，但缺乏对生成机制的理解，导致去偏方法脆弱。需要系统研究LLM不公平性的机制。

Method: 1. 比较直接回答和思维链提示策略；2. 定义token-to-head贡献分数追踪偏见来源；3. 提出DiffHeads框架，通过差异激活分析识别偏见头并选择性屏蔽。

Result: 直接回答提示会触发LLM的固有偏见，使不公平性增加534.5%-391.9%；发现偏见头小集群；DiffHeads在直接回答和思维链提示下分别减少不公平性49.4%和40.3%。

Conclusion: 揭示了提示策略与偏见出现的因果联系，提出的DiffHeads框架能有效减少LLM不公平性且不影响模型效用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate decisions in domains where
unfair treatment of demographic groups is unacceptable. Existing work probes
when biased outputs appear, but gives little insight into the mechanisms that
generate them, leaving existing mitigations largely fragile. In this paper, we
conduct a systematic investigation LLM unfairness and propose DiffHeads, a
lightweight debiasing framework for LLMs. We first compare Direct-Answer (DA)
prompting to Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting across eight representative open-
and closed-source LLMs. DA will trigger the nature bias part of LLM and improve
measured unfairness by 534.5%-391.9% in both one-turn and two-turn dialogues.
Next, we define a token-to-head contribution score that traces each token's
influence back to individual attention heads. This reveals a small cluster of
bias heads that activate under DA but stay largely dormant with CoT, providing
the first causal link between prompting strategy and bias emergence. Finally,
building on this insight, we propose DiffHeads that identifies bias heads
through differential activation analysis between DA and CoT, and selectively
masks only those heads. DiffHeads reduces unfairness by 49.4%, and 40.3% under
DA and CoT, respectively, without harming model utility.

TL;DR: BILLY是一个无需训练的框架，通过在激活空间中提取和融合多个不同人格向量，在单个模型中实现多LLM协作的创意优势，显著降低计算成本和推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多LLM系统虽然能增强大语言模型的创造力，但存在计算成本高、推理延迟大的问题，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 在模型激活空间中提取多个不同的人格向量，将这些向量融合后用于引导模型生成过程，实现多视角输出而无需显式的多LLM通信。

Result: 在面向创造力的基准测试中，BILLY超越了单模型提示和传统多LLM方法，同时大幅减少了推理时间和计算成本。

Conclusion: 不同人格向量的融合能够有效控制生成的互补方面，并提高可解释性，为高效的多视角生成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Multi-LLM systems enhance the creativity of large language models by
simulating human collective intelligence but suffer from significant drawbacks,
such as high computational costs and inference latency. To address these
limitations, we propose BILLY (BlendIng persona vectors for Large Language
model creativitY), a training-free framework that captures the benefits of
multi-LLM collaboration, i.e. inducing diverse perspectives and specialized
expertise, within a single model. BILLY operates by extracting and blending
multiple distinct persona vectors directly in the model's activation space. We
steer the model's generation process with this merged vector while inference,
enabling multi-perspective output without explicit multi-LLM communication. Our
experiments across creativity-oriented benchmarks demonstrate that BILLY
surpasses single model prompting and traditional multi-LLM approaches, while
substantially reducing inference time and computational costs. Our analyses
further reveal that distinct persona vectors can be blended to achieve both
effective control over complementary aspects of generation and greater
interpretability.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized
artificial intelligence, shifting from supporting objective tasks (e.g.,
recognition) to empowering subjective decision-making (e.g., planning,
decision). This marks the dawn of general and powerful AI, with applications
spanning a wide range of fields, including programming, education, healthcare,
finance, and law. However, their deployment introduces multifaceted risks. Due
to the black-box nature of LLMs and the human-like quality of their generated
content, issues such as hallucinations, bias, unfairness, and copyright
infringement become particularly significant. In this context, sourcing
information from multiple perspectives is essential.
  This survey presents a systematic investigation into provenance tracking for
content generated by LLMs, organized around four interrelated dimensions that
together capture both model- and data-centric perspectives. From the model
perspective, Model Sourcing treats the model as a whole, aiming to distinguish
content generated by specific LLMs from content authored by humans. Model
Structure Sourcing delves into the internal generative mechanisms, analyzing
architectural components that shape the outputs of model. From the data
perspective, Training Data Sourcing focuses on internal attribution, tracing
the origins of generated content back to the training data of model. In
contrast, External Data Sourcing emphasizes external validation, identifying
external information used to support or influence the responses of model.
Moreover, we also propose a dual-paradigm taxonomy that classifies existing
sourcing methods into prior-based (proactive traceability embedding) and
posterior-based (retrospective inference) approaches. Traceability across these
dimensions enhances the transparency, accountability, and trustworthiness of
LLMs deployment in real-world applications.

Abstract: Reasoning is an important task for large language models (LLMs). Among all
the reasoning paradigms, inductive reasoning is one of the fundamental types,
which is characterized by its particular-to-general thinking process and the
non-uniqueness of its answers. The inductive mode is crucial for knowledge
generalization and aligns better with human cognition, so it is a fundamental
mode of learning, hence attracting increasing interest. Despite the importance
of inductive reasoning, there is no systematic summary of it. Therefore, this
paper presents the first comprehensive survey of inductive reasoning for LLMs.
First, methods for improving inductive reasoning are categorized into three
main areas: post-training, test-time scaling, and data augmentation. Then,
current benchmarks of inductive reasoning are summarized, and a unified
sandbox-based evaluation approach with the observation coverage metric is
derived. Finally, we offer some analyses regarding the source of inductive
ability and how simple model architectures and data help with inductive tasks,
providing a solid foundation for future research.

Motivation: 现有评估主要关注最终答案准确性，将多智能体系统的内部协作过程视为不透明的"黑箱"，忽略了诊断结论是否通过合理且可验证的推理路径得出，这在高风险医疗应用中存在重大风险。

Method: 对六个医疗数据集和六个代表性多智能体框架的3,600个案例进行大规模实证研究，采用结合定性分析和定量审计的混合方法，开发了协作失败模式的全面分类法。

Result: 定量审计揭示了四种主导的失败模式：由共享模型缺陷驱动的错误共识、正确少数意见被压制、无效的讨论动态以及合成过程中的关键信息丢失。

Conclusion: 仅靠高准确性不足以建立临床或公众信任，迫切需要透明且可审计的推理过程，这是负责任开发和部署医疗AI的基石。

Abstract: While large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems show promise in
simulating medical consultations, their evaluation is often confined to
final-answer accuracy. This practice treats their internal collaborative
processes as opaque "black boxes" and overlooks a critical question: is a
diagnostic conclusion reached through a sound and verifiable reasoning pathway?
The inscrutable nature of these systems poses a significant risk in high-stakes
medical applications, potentially leading to flawed or untrustworthy
conclusions. To address this, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of 3,600
cases from six medical datasets and six representative multi-agent frameworks.
Through a rigorous, mixed-methods approach combining qualitative analysis with
quantitative auditing, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of collaborative
failure modes. Our quantitative audit reveals four dominant failure patterns:
flawed consensus driven by shared model deficiencies, suppression of correct
minority opinions, ineffective discussion dynamics, and critical information
loss during synthesis. This study demonstrates that high accuracy alone is an
insufficient measure of clinical or public trust. It highlights the urgent need
for transparent and auditable reasoning processes, a cornerstone for the
responsible development and deployment of medical AI.

Motivation: 现实场景中训练数据不可避免地包含噪声标签，传统方法基于小损失选择样本但容易形成恶性循环，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出Delora框架，引入干净和噪声LoRA建立噪声标签检测器，利用记忆效应让干净LoRA记忆干净数据，噪声LoRA记忆误标数据，作为可学习阈值来选择样本。

Result: 在合成和真实噪声数据集上的实验结果表明，Delora在噪声标签检测和文本分类方面具有有效性。

Conclusion: Delora通过解耦样本选择与模型训练，成功打破了噪声标签学习中的恶性循环，为处理噪声标签问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) large language models (LLMs) have
shown impressive performance in various downstream tasks. However, in many
real-world scenarios, the collected training data inevitably contains noisy
labels. To learn from noisy labels, most solutions select samples with small
losses for model training. However, the selected samples, in turn, impact the
loss computation in the next iteration. An inaccurate initial selection can
create a vicious cycle, leading to suboptimal performance. To break this cycle,
we propose Delora, a novel framework that decouples the sample selection from
model training. For sample selection, Delora establishes a noisy label detector
by introducing clean and noisy LoRA. Benefiting from the memory effect, the
clean LoRA is encouraged to memorize clean data, while the noisy LoRA is
constrained to memorize mislabeled data, which serves as a learnable threshold
for selecting clean and noisy samples. For model training, Delora can use
carefully selected samples to fine-tune language models seamlessly.
Experimental results on synthetic and real-world noisy datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Delora in noisy label detection and text classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在专业领域部署时面临训练数据分布偏移的挑战，而领域特定微调需要昂贵的高质量标注数据。

Method: SyTTA框架耦合两种互补的不确定性信号：输入侧困惑度（指示与领域特定术语和模式的失配）和输出侧预测熵（指示生成过程中token概率的分散和不稳定性）。

Result: 在多样化模型架构和领域特定基准测试中，SyTTA带来了一致的性能提升，特别是在农业问答任务上，Qwen-2.5-7B模型的Rouge-LSum指标提升了超过120%，每个查询仅需4个额外token。

Conclusion: 无需标注示例即可实现语言模型的有效测试时适应，支持在标签稀缺领域的部署。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in specialized domains
such as finance, medicine, and agriculture, where they face significant
distribution shifts from their training data. Domain-specific fine-tuning can
mitigate this challenge but relies on high-quality labeled data that is
expensive and slow to collect in expertise-limited settings. We study
label-free test-time adaptation for language models and present SyTTA, an
inference-time framework that adapts models on-the-fly without additional
supervision. SyTTA couples two complementary uncertainty signals that arise
under distribution shift: input-side perplexity, indicating mismatch with
domain-specific terminology and patterns, and output-side predictive entropy,
indicating diffuse and unstable token probabilities during generation. Across
diverse model architectures and domain-specific benchmarks, SyTTA delivers
consistent gains. Notably, on agricultural question answering, SyTTA improves
Rouge-LSum by over 120% on Qwen-2.5-7B with only 4 extra tokens per query.
These results show that effective test-time adaptation for language models is
achievable without labeled examples, supporting deployment in label-scarce
domains. The code will be made available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Unsupervised text representation learning (TRL) is a fundamental task in
natural language processing, which is beneficial for improving search and
recommendations with the web's unlabeled texts. A recent empirical study finds
that the high-quality representation aligns with the key token of the input
text, uncovering the potential connection between representation space and
vocabulary space. Inspired by the findings, we revisit the generative tasks and
develop an unsupervised generative framework for TRL, Text2Token. The framework
is based on the token target prediction task, utilizing carefully constructed
target token distribution as supervisory signals. To construct the high-quality
target token distribution, we analyze the token-alignment properties with
advanced embedders and identify two essential categories of key tokens: (1) the
meaningful tokens in the text and (2) semantically derived tokens beyond the
text. Based on these insights, we propose two methods -- data-driven and
model-derived -- to construct synthetic token targets from data or the LLM
backbone. Experiments on the MTEB v2 benchmark demonstrate that Text2Token
achieves performance competitive with the state-of-the-art embedder with
unsupervised contrastive learning, LLM2Vec. Our analysis further shows that
vocabulary and representation spaces optimize together and toward the optimum
solution during training, providing new ideas and insights for future work.

Conclusion: ImCoref-CeS成功整合了监督神经方法和LLM的优势，在共指消解任务上取得了突破性进展。

Abstract: Coreference Resolution (CR) is a critical task in Natural Language Processing
(NLP). Current research faces a key dilemma: whether to further explore the
potential of supervised neural methods based on small language models, whose
detect-then-cluster pipeline still delivers top performance, or embrace the
powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, effectively
combining their strengths remains underexplored. To this end, we propose
\textbf{ImCoref-CeS}, a novel framework that integrates an enhanced supervised
model with LLM-based reasoning. First, we present an improved CR method
(\textbf{ImCoref}) to push the performance boundaries of the supervised neural
method by introducing a lightweight bridging module to enhance long-text
encoding capability, devising a biaffine scorer to comprehensively capture
positional information, and invoking a hybrid mention regularization to improve
training efficiency. Importantly, we employ an LLM acting as a multi-role
Checker-Splitter agent to validate candidate mentions (filtering out invalid
ones) and coreference results (splitting erroneous clusters) predicted by
ImCoref. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ImCoref-CeS,
which achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods.

Motivation: 大语言模型经常生成看似连贯但基于未经证实假设的推理轨迹，导致产生幻觉结论。现有工作主要关注事实性幻觉或依赖事后验证，对推理引发的幻觉问题关注不足。

Method: 审计理解框架包含三个阶段：(1)将查询分解为候选假设，(2)审计这些假设的支持证据，(3)仅基于已验证的子集进行推理。该框架在形式上属于后验约束推理。

Result: 在GSM8K、MultiArith和SVAMP数据集上显著提升了准确性和忠实性，相比Chain-of-Thought、Self-Consistency和CoT-Decoding方法，在GSM8K上提升达+30%，MultiArith上+45%，SVAMP上持续提升20-28%。

Conclusion: 审计理解框架通过约束推理于已验证前提，有效解决了推理引发的幻觉问题，在理论和实证层面都表现出色。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate reasoning traces that appear
coherent but rest on unsupported assumptions, leading to hallucinated
conclusions. Prior work mainly addresses factual hallucinations or relies on
post-hoc verification, leaving reasoning-induced hallucinations largely
unaddressed. We propose Audit-of-Understanding (AoU), a framework that
constrains inference to validated premises through three phases: (1)
decomposing a query into candidate assumptions, (2) auditing their support, and
(3) conditioning inference only on the validated subset. Formally, AoU is
\emph{posterior-constrained inference}, connecting to selective prediction and
rejection learning. Our contributions are threefold: (i) theoretical guarantees
under perfect validation, (ii) excess-risk bounds under imperfect audits, and
(iii) tractability analysis. Empirically, AoU improves both accuracy and
faithfulness on GSM8K, MultiArith, and SVAMP, achieving up to +30% gains on
GSM8K, +45% on MultiArith, and consistent +20--28% improvements on SVAMP over
Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and CoT-Decoding. Code is available at

Method: 两阶段防御框架：首先通过注入已知触发器聚集后门表示，然后进行恢复微调以恢复良性输出。

Result: 在多个基准测试中将平均攻击成功率降至4.41%，优于现有基线28.1%~69.3%；干净准确率和实用性保持在原始模型0.5%以内；防御方法对不同类型后门具有泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在无需预知触发设置的情况下有效防御后门攻击，保持模型性能，具有实际部署的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks are a significant threat to large language models (LLMs),
often embedded via public checkpoints, yet existing defenses rely on
impractical assumptions about trigger settings. To address this challenge, we
propose \ourmethod, a defense framework that requires no prior knowledge of
trigger settings. \ourmethod is based on the key observation that when
deliberately injecting known backdoors into an already-compromised model, both
existing unknown and newly injected backdoors aggregate in the representation
space. \ourmethod leverages this through a two-stage process: \textbf{first},
aggregating backdoor representations by injecting known triggers, and
\textbf{then}, performing recovery fine-tuning to restore benign outputs.
Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that: (I)
\ourmethod reduces the average Attack Success Rate to 4.41\% across multiple
benchmarks, outperforming existing baselines by 28.1\%$\sim$69.3\%$\uparrow$.
(II) Clean accuracy and utility are preserved within 0.5\% of the original
model, ensuring negligible impact on legitimate tasks. (III) The defense
generalizes across different types of backdoors, confirming its robustness in
practical deployment scenarios.

Motivation: 多语言大语言模型在跨语言事实知识回忆中经常出现不一致性，但导致这种不一致性的因素尚不清楚。作者假设这可能源于实体对齐的失败。

Method: 通过实体级翻译任务评估对齐，并提出SubSub和SubInj两种方法，将英文实体翻译整合到多语言提示中。

Result: 研究发现一致性与对齐强相关，提出的方法显著提高了事实回忆准确性和一致性，并通过机制分析揭示了这些干预通过模型的内部枢纽语言处理加强了实体表示对齐。

Conclusion: 实体对齐是多语言事实预测一致性的关键因素，提出的方法提供了改善多语言事实预测的有效实用策略。

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) are expected to recall factual
knowledge consistently across languages. However, the factors that give rise to
such crosslingual consistency -- and its frequent failure -- remain poorly
understood. In this work, we hypothesize that these inconsistencies may arise
from failures in entity alignment, the process of mapping subject and object
entities into a shared conceptual space across languages. To test this, we
assess alignment through entity-level (subject and object) translation tasks,
and find that consistency is strongly correlated with alignment across all
studied models, with misalignment of subjects or objects frequently resulting
in inconsistencies. Building on this insight, we propose SubSub and SubInj, two
effective methods that integrate English translations of subjects into prompts
across languages, leading to substantial gains in both factual recall accuracy
and consistency. Finally, our mechanistic analysis reveals that these
interventions reinforce the entity representation alignment in the conceptual
space through model's internal pivot-language processing, offering effective
and practical strategies for improving multilingual factual prediction.

Result: 在AIME2025上仅用DeepConf 4%计算量达到99.79分，多模型和多模态基准测试验证有效性和通用性

Conclusion: 为高级语言模型的高效可扩展测试时推理策略设计提供了新思路

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a promising paradigm in language modeling,
wherein additional computational resources are allocated during inference to
enhance model performance. Recent approaches, such as DeepConf, have
demonstrated the efficacy of this strategy, however, they often incur
substantial computational overhead to achieve competitive results. In this
work, we propose MatryoshkaThinking, a novel method that significantly reduces
computational cost while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.
Specifically, MatryoshkaThinking attains a score of 99.79 on AIME2025 using
only 4% of the computation required by DeepConf. The core of our approach lies
in the recursive exploitation of the model's intrinsic capabilities in
reasoning, verification, and summarization, which collectively enhance the
retention of correct solutions and reduce the disparity between Pass@k and
Pass@1. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple open-source models and
challenging multi-modal reasoning benchmarks validate the effectiveness and
generality of our method. These findings offer new insights into the design of
efficient and scalable test-time inference strategies for advanced language

*Ananya Malik,Nazanin Sabri,Melissa Karnaze,Mai Elsherief*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在不同人口统计特征用户群体间的共情能力存在差异，通过315个交叉人口特征组合的分析显示，模型共情响应受年龄、文化和性别等属性显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs是否能在不同人口统计特征的用户群体间展现公平的共情能力，因为情感体验受到人口统计和文化背景的影响。

Method: 提出了一个分析框架，对315个由年龄、文化和性别交叉组合形成的独特用户角色进行交叉分析，涵盖四个LLMs模型。

Result: 结果显示人口统计属性显著影响模型的共情响应，多个属性叠加会减弱甚至逆转预期的共情模式。模型总体上反映了现实世界的共情趋势，但对某些群体（如儒家文化群体）存在明显偏差。

Conclusion: 强调设计考虑人口多样性的共情感知LLMs的重要性，以促进更包容和公平的模型行为。

Abstract: Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to converse naturally is empowered by
their ability to empathetically understand and respond to their users. However,
emotional experiences are shaped by demographic and cultural contexts. This
raises an important question: Can LLMs demonstrate equitable empathy across
diverse user groups? We propose a framework to investigate how LLMs' cognitive
and affective empathy vary across user personas defined by intersecting
demographic attributes. Our study introduces a novel intersectional analysis
spanning 315 unique personas, constructed from combinations of age, culture,
and gender, across four LLMs. Results show that attributes profoundly shape a
model's empathetic responses. Interestingly, we see that adding multiple
attributes at once can attenuate and reverse expected empathy patterns. We show
that they broadly reflect real-world empathetic trends, with notable
misalignments for certain groups, such as those from Confucian culture. We
complement our quantitative findings with qualitative insights to uncover model
behaviour patterns across different demographic groups. Our findings highlight
the importance of designing empathy-aware LLMs that account for demographic
diversity to promote more inclusive and equitable model behaviour.

Motivation: 探索将预训练语音编码器与大型语言模型结合的端到端架构，以同时处理语音识别和语音翻译任务，克服传统级联系统的局限性。

Method: 采用预训练语音编码器和大型语言模型相结合的端到端架构，同时执行自动语音识别和语音翻译。

Result: 在英德语言对上的实验显示，最佳模型在COMET DA22指标上比SeamlessM4T提升高达8%，且能达到Whisper和NLLB级联系统的性能水平。

Conclusion: 结合预训练语音编码器和大型语言模型的端到端架构在语音翻译任务中表现出色，优于大型基础端到端模型，并能匹配级联系统的性能。

Abstract: Speech Translation (ST) is a machine translation task that involves
converting speech signals from one language to the corresponding text in
another language; this task has two different approaches, namely the
traditional cascade and the more recent end-to-end. This paper explores a
combined end-to-end architecture of pre-trained speech encoders and Large
Language Models (LLMs) for performing both Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
and ST simultaneously. Experiments with the English-to-German language pair
show that our best model not only can achieve better translation results than
SeamlessM4T, a large foundational end-to-end, multi-modal translation model,
but can also match the performance of a cascaded system with Whisper and NLLB,
with up to a score gain of 8% in $\text{COMET}^{\text{DA}}_{22}$ metric.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个名为ASC分析器的Python包，用于自动标注论元结构构式并计算50个指标，以分析二语写作能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具在测量论元结构构式使用方面存在局限性，需要可扩展和系统化的工具来分析二语熟练度。

Method: 开发ASC分析器Python包，自动标注ASCs并计算多样性、比例、频率和ASC-动词关联强度等50个指标。

Result: 通过双变量和多变量分析，验证了ASC指标与二语写作分数之间的关系。

Conclusion: ASC分析器为二语熟练度分析提供了有效的工具，能够系统化地测量论元结构构式的使用情况。

Abstract: Argument structure constructions (ASCs) offer a theoretically grounded lens
for analyzing second language (L2) proficiency, yet scalable and systematic
tools for measuring their usage remain limited. This paper introduces the ASC
analyzer, a publicly available Python package designed to address this gap. The
analyzer automatically tags ASCs and computes 50 indices that capture
diversity, proportion, frequency, and ASC-verb lemma association strength. To
demonstrate its utility, we conduct both bivariate and multivariate analyses
that examine the relationship between ASC-based indices and L2 writing scores.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究开发了RefusalBench基准测试，通过程序化生成诊断测试案例来评估语言模型在RAG系统中基于有缺陷上下文选择性拒绝回答的能力，发现前沿模型在此任务上表现不佳，拒绝准确率低于50%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在RAG系统中基于有缺陷上下文选择性拒绝回答的能力对安全性至关重要，但目前仍是显著失败点，现有静态基准测试无法可靠评估这一能力。

Method: 引入RefusalBench生成方法，通过受控语言扰动程序化创建诊断测试案例，使用176种不同扰动策略，涵盖六类信息不确定性和三个强度级别，评估了30多个模型。

Result: 发现系统性失败模式：拒绝能力包含可分离的检测和分类技能，规模和扩展推理都无法提升性能，选择性拒绝是可训练、对齐敏感的能力。

Conclusion: 选择性拒绝是可训练的对齐敏感能力，提供了明确的改进路径，发布了两个基准测试和完整生成框架以支持持续动态评估。

Abstract: The ability of language models in RAG systems to selectively refuse to answer
based on flawed context is critical for safety, yet remains a significant
failure point. Our large-scale study reveals that even frontier models struggle
in this setting, with refusal accuracy dropping below 50% on multi-document
tasks, while exhibiting either dangerous overconfidence or overcaution. Static
benchmarks fail to reliably evaluate this capability, as models exploit
dataset-specific artifacts and memorize test instances. We introduce
RefusalBench, a generative methodology that programmatically creates diagnostic
test cases through controlled linguistic perturbation. Our framework employs
176 distinct perturbation strategies across six categories of informational
uncertainty and three intensity levels. Evaluation of over 30 models uncovers
systematic failure patterns: refusal comprises separable detection and
categorization skills, and neither scale nor extended reasoning improves
performance. We find that selective refusal is a trainable, alignment-sensitive
capability, offering a clear path for improvement. We release two benchmarks --
RefusalBench-NQ (single document) and RefusalBench-GaRAGe (multi-document) --
and our complete generation framework to enable continued, dynamic evaluation
of this critical capability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AssoMem是一个新颖的关联记忆图框架，通过自动提取线索将对话话语锚定，结合多维检索信号（相关性、重要性和时间对齐），在相似性密集场景中显著提升问答任务的记忆召回性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖语义距离进行检索，在相似性密集场景中准确召回大规模记忆仍是一个核心挑战。受人类关联信息方式的启发，需要开发更有效的记忆检索方法。

Method: 构建关联记忆图，将对话话语锚定到自动提取的线索上；集成多维检索信号（相关性、重要性、时间对齐），采用自适应互信息驱动的融合策略。

Result: 在三个基准测试和新引入的MeetingQA数据集上的广泛实验表明，AssoMem始终优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: AssoMem在上下文感知记忆召回方面具有优越性，验证了关联记忆图框架在问答任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Accurate recall from large scale memories remains a core challenge for memory
augmented AI assistants performing question answering (QA), especially in
similarity dense scenarios where existing methods mainly rely on semantic
distance to the query for retrieval. Inspired by how humans link information
associatively, we propose AssoMem, a novel framework constructing an
associative memory graph that anchors dialogue utterances to automatically
extracted clues. This structure provides a rich organizational view of the
conversational context and facilitates importance aware ranking. Further,
AssoMem integrates multi-dimensional retrieval signals-relevance, importance,
and temporal alignment using an adaptive mutual information (MI) driven fusion
strategy. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks and a newly introduced
dataset, MeetingQA, demonstrate that AssoMem consistently outperforms SOTA
baselines, verifying its superiority in context-aware memory recall.

*Geunyeong Jeong,Juoh Sun,Seonghee Lee,Harksoo Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了STEAM框架，通过语义层面的知识编辑来增强更新知识在模型知识结构中的整合，解决现有方法在语义连贯性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑方法主要关注token级似然优化，但缺乏语义连贯性，导致编辑后的知识在潜在空间中形成孤立的残差流，无法与现有知识自然整合。

Method: STEAM框架首先识别目标表示作为更新事实关联的语义锚点，然后通过对齐损失在优化过程中引导编辑事实的内部表示向这些锚点对齐。

Result: 实验结果表明STEAM提高了模型使用编辑知识进行推理的能力，并增强了语义连贯性。

Conclusion: 潜在空间对齐对于可靠和连贯的知识编辑至关重要，STEAM框架为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models store extensive factual knowledge acquired during
large-scale pre-training. However, this knowledge is inherently static,
reflecting only the state of the world at the time of training. Knowledge
editing has emerged as a promising solution for updating outdated or incorrect
facts without full retraining. However, most existing locate-and-edit methods
primarily focus on token-level likelihood optimization without addressing
semantic coherence. Our analysis reveals that such edited knowledge is often
encoded as isolated residual streams in the model's latent space, distinct from
pre-existing knowledge and bypassing natural reasoning process. To address
this, we propose \textsc{Steam}, a semantic-level knowledge editing framework
that enhances integration of updated knowledge into the model's knowledge
structure. \textsc{Steam} first identifies target representations as semantic
anchors for the updated factual association, then guides the internal
representation of the edited fact towards these anchors through an alignment
loss during optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that \textsc{Steam}
improves model's ability to reason with edited knowledge and enhances semantic
coherence, underscoring the importance of latent-space alignment for reliable
and coherent knowledge editing. The code is available at

*Federica Bologna,Tiffany Pan,Matthew Wilkens,Yue Guo,Lucy Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongQAEval是一个用于评估长格式临床问答系统的框架，通过比较粗粒度和细粒度标注方法，发现在正确性维度上细粒度标注更可靠，在相关性维度上粗粒度标注更好，安全性的标注一致性较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估长格式临床问答系统需要医学专业知识且资源密集，人工判断在长文本上难以保持一致性，因此需要开发有效的评估方法。

Method: 基于300个真实患者问题（由医生和LLM回答）的医生标注，比较了答案级粗粒度评估和句子级细粒度评估在正确性、相关性和安全性三个维度上的表现。

Result: 不同维度的标注者间一致性不同：细粒度标注在正确性上一致性更高，粗粒度标注在相关性上更好，安全性判断的一致性较差。仅标注少量句子子集即可达到与粗粒度标注相当的可靠性。

Conclusion: LongQAEval为资源有限和高专业知识要求的场景提供了评估建议，通过选择适当的标注粒度可以降低评估成本和努力。

Abstract: Evaluating long-form clinical question answering (QA) systems is
resource-intensive and challenging: accurate judgments require medical
expertise and achieving consistent human judgments over long-form text is
difficult. We introduce LongQAEval, an evaluation framework and set of
evaluation recommendations for limited-resource and high-expertise settings.
Based on physician annotations of 300 real patient questions answered by
physicians and LLMs, we compare coarse answer-level versus fine-grained
sentence-level evaluation over the dimensions of correctness, relevance, and
safety. We find that inter-annotator agreement (IAA) varies by dimension:
fine-grained annotation improves agreement on correctness, coarse improves
agreement on relevance, and judgments on safety remain inconsistent.
Additionally, annotating only a small subset of sentences can provide
reliability comparable to coarse annotations, reducing cost and effort.

*Jingyi Chen,Zhimeng Guo,Jiyun Chun,Pichao Wang,Andrew Perrault,Micha Elsner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LISTEN基准测试显示，当前大型音频语言模型在情感理解中主要依赖词汇线索而非声学信息，表现出词汇主导现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型音频语言模型是否真正处理声学信息，还是主要依赖词汇内容进行情感理解。

Method: 开发LISTEN基准测试，通过控制词汇和声学线索的对比设置来评估模型表现，包括线索对齐、冲突和副语言情境。

Result: 六个最先进模型都表现出词汇主导：词汇中性时预测"中性"，线索对齐时改进有限，线索冲突时无法区分情感，副语言情境下表现接近随机。

Conclusion: 当前LALM主要"转录"而非"倾听"，过度依赖词汇语义而未能充分利用声学线索。LISTEN为多模态模型情感理解评估提供了原则性框架。

Abstract: Understanding emotion from speech requires sensitivity to both lexical and
acoustic cues. However, it remains unclear whether large audio language models
(LALMs) genuinely process acoustic information or rely primarily on lexical
content. We present LISTEN (Lexical vs. Acoustic Speech Test for Emotion in
Narratives), a controlled benchmark designed to disentangle lexical reliance
from acoustic sensitivity in emotion understanding. Across evaluations of six
state-of-the-art LALMs, we observe a consistent lexical dominance. Models
predict "neutral" when lexical cues are neutral or absent, show limited gains
under cue alignment, and fail to classify distinct emotions under cue conflict.
In paralinguistic settings, performance approaches chance. These results
indicate that current LALMs largely "transcribe" rather than "listen," relying
heavily on lexical semantics while underutilizing acoustic cues. LISTEN offers
a principled framework for assessing emotion understanding in multimodal
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RECON框架通过集成显式摘要模块压缩检索证据，减少35%上下文长度，提升RAG系统训练速度和推理延迟，同时在下游QA基准上提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于强化学习的检索增强生成系统存在上下文管理效率低下的问题，长而嘈杂的检索文档会增加成本并降低性能。

Method: RECON框架在推理循环中集成显式摘要模块，通过两阶段训练：在QA数据集上进行相关性预训练，然后从专有LLM进行多方面蒸馏以确保事实性和清晰度。

Result: 在Search-R1管道中，RECON将总上下文长度减少35%，3B模型的平均EM分数提升14.5%，7B模型提升3.0%，在多跳QA任务中表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: RECON表明学习型上下文压缩对于构建实用、可扩展和高性能的RAG系统至关重要。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems trained using reinforcement
learning (RL) with reasoning are hampered by inefficient context management,
where long, noisy retrieved documents increase costs and degrade performance.
We introduce RECON (REasoning with CONdensation), a framework that integrates
an explicit summarization module to compress evidence within the reasoning
loop. Our summarizer is trained via a two-stage process: relevance pretraining
on QA datasets, followed by multi-aspect distillation from proprietary LLMs to
ensure factuality and clarity. Integrated into the Search-R1 pipeline, RECON
reduces total context length by 35\%, leading to improved training speed and
inference latency, while simultaneously improving RAG performance on downstream
QA benchmarks. Notably, it boosts the average EM score of the 3B model by
14.5\% and the 7B model by 3.0\%, showing particular strength in multi-hop QA.
RECON demonstrates that learned context compression is essential for building
practical, scalable, and performant RAG systems. Our code implementation is
made available at https://github.com/allfornancy/RECON.

TL;DR: 论文分析了大型语言模型在安全对齐中导致的过度拒绝问题，构建了RagRefuse基准测试，并提出SafeRAG-Steering方法来缓解这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 安全对齐导致LLMs过度拒绝良性请求，特别是在检索增强生成中，查询意图和检索上下文特性都会影响拒绝行为。

Method: 构建RagRefuse基准测试，涵盖医疗、化学和开放领域，控制上下文污染模式和大小；提出SafeRAG-Steering方法，通过模型中心的嵌入干预在推理时引导输出到安全区域。

Result: 分析显示上下文安排/污染、查询和上下文领域、有害文本密度都会触发对良性查询的拒绝，效果取决于模型特定的对齐选择。

Conclusion: SafeRAG-Steering方法能有效减少污染RAG管道中的过度拒绝，同时保持合法的拒绝行为。

Abstract: Safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) induces over-refusals --
where LLMs decline benign requests due to aggressive safety filters. We analyze
this phenomenon in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where both the query
intent and retrieved context properties influence refusal behavior. We
construct RagRefuse, a domain-stratified benchmark spanning medical, chemical,
and open domains, pairing benign and harmful queries with controlled context
contamination patterns and sizes. Our analysis shows that context arrangement /
contamination, domain of query and context, and harmful-text density trigger
refusals even on benign queries, with effects depending on model-specific
alignment choices. To mitigate over-refusals, we introduce
\textsc{SafeRAG-Steering}, a model-centric embedding intervention that steers
the embedding regions towards the confirmed safe, non-refusing output regions
at inference time. This reduces over-refusals in contaminated RAG pipelines
while preserving legitimate refusals.

Motivation: 解决语音识别中语音长度与文本长度不匹配的挑战，特别是在两者长度相近时传统CTC方法无法有效对齐的问题

Method: 提出时间独立性损失（TIL）和基于编辑距离的对齐交叉熵损失（AXE），结合帧融合技术（关键帧与上下文2帧加权求和）

Result: 在AISHELL-1和AISHELL-2数据集子集上，提出的方法优于先前工作，帧数减少至少86%

Conclusion: 新提出的对齐方法和帧融合技术能有效解决语音文本对齐问题，显著提升ASR性能

Abstract: The mismatch of speech length and text length poses a challenge in automatic
speech recognition (ASR). In previous research, various approaches have been
employed to align text with speech, including the utilization of Connectionist
Temporal Classification (CTC). In earlier work, a key frame mechanism (KFDS)
was introduced, utilizing intermediate CTC outputs to guide downsampling and
preserve keyframes, but traditional methods (CTC) failed to align speech and
text appropriately when downsampling speech to a text-similar length. In this
paper, we focus on speech recognition in those cases where the length of speech
aligns closely with that of the corresponding text. To address this issue, we
introduce two methods for alignment: a) Time Independence Loss (TIL) and b)
Aligned Cross Entropy (AXE) Loss, which is based on edit distance. To enhance
the information on keyframes, we incorporate frame fusion by applying weights
and summing the keyframe with its context 2 frames. Experimental results on
AISHELL-1 and AISHELL-2 dataset subsets show that the proposed methods
outperform the previous work and achieve a reduction of at least 86\% in the
number of frames.

Motivation: 基准套件规模不断扩大，需要系统框架来整合冗余减少和性能预测方法，确保预测准确性和排名一致性。

Method: 先进行样本级冗余分析，然后将基准压缩建模为得分重构优化问题，提出基于迭代遗传算法的粗到细框架，结合基于适应度的子集搜索和基于归因的样本搜索。

Result: 在HellaSwag基准上，使用25倍更少样本时所有模型排名变化在5%以内，使用200倍更少样本时达到95%排名保持率（变化在5%以内）。

Conclusion: EssenceBench方法相比先前方法在压缩效果、重构误差和效率方面表现更优，能显著减少基准规模同时保持模型评估准确性。

Abstract: As the demand for comprehensive evaluations of diverse model capabilities
steadily increases, benchmark suites have correspondingly grown significantly
in scale. Despite notable advances in redundancy reduction and subset-level
performance prediction, a systematic framework that effectively integrates
these methods to ensure both prediction accuracy and ranking consistency is
still largely elusive. In this paper, we first perform a sample-level analysis
of benchmark redundancy and identify several highly similar samples that can be
eliminated. Besides, we frame benchmark compression as an optimization problem
with the aim of score reconstruction. Building on these, we then propose
EssenceBench, a coarse-to-fine framework utilizing an iterative Genetic
Algorithm (GA), which takes the advantages of fitness-based subset search and
attribution-based sample search. Compared to previous methods, our approach
yields superior compression results with lower reconstruction error and
markedly higher efficiency. In particular, on the HellaSwag benchmark (10K
samples), our method preserves the ranking of all models shifting within 5%
using 25x fewer samples, and achieves 95% ranking preservation shifting within
5% using only 200x fewer samples.

Abstract: Digital communication has become the cornerstone of modern interaction,
enabling rapid, accessible, and interactive exchanges. However, individuals
with lower academic literacy often face significant barriers, exacerbating the
"digital divide". In this work, we introduce a novel, universal ideographic
metalanguage designed as an innovative communication framework that transcends
academic, linguistic, and cultural boundaries. Our approach leverages
principles of Neuro-symbolic AI, combining neural-based large language models
(LLMs) enriched with world knowledge and symbolic knowledge heuristics grounded
in the linguistic theory of Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM). This enables
the semantic decomposition of complex ideas into simpler, atomic concepts.
Adopting a human-centric, collaborative methodology, we engaged over 200
semi-literate participants in defining the problem, selecting ideographs, and
validating the system. With over 80\% semantic comprehensibility, an accessible
learning curve, and universal adaptability, our system effectively serves
underprivileged populations with limited formal education.

Motivation: 现有评估自动机器学习研究代理的基准测试存在局限性：过度强调工程方面而忽视学术严谨性、任务多样性有限、过于关注应用导向任务而非基础研究问题、难以扩展到现实研究环境。

Method: 开发了FML-bench基准测试，包含8个不同的基础机器学习研究问题，减少编码负担，强调基础问题而非特定用例，提供高任务多样性，并可扩展到真实世界的机器学习GitHub仓库。同时提出了包含5个互补指标的统一评估框架。

Conclusion: 强调探索的广度可能比仅仅专注于增量改进带来更有效的研究成果。FML-bench为评估自动机器学习研究代理提供了更全面和现实的测试平台。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in automatic
machine learning research agents. Among them, agents capable of autonomously
proposing ideas and conducting machine learning experiments are particularly
promising, as they maximize research automation and accelerate scientific
progress by iteratively refining ideas based on experimental results. However,
comprehensively evaluating such agents remains challenging. Existing benchmarks
tend to overemphasize engineering aspects while neglecting academic rigor,
creating barriers that obscure a clear assessment of an agent's scientific
capabilities in machine learning research. They also suffer from limited task
diversity, an overemphasis on application-oriented tasks over fundamental
research problems, and limited scalability to realistic research settings. To
address these limitations, we introduce FML-bench, a benchmark designed to
evaluate automatic machine learning research agents on 8 diverse and
fundamental machine learning research problems. It reduces coding burden,
emphasizes fundamental problems rather than specific use cases, offers high
task diversity, and is extensible to real-world machine learning GitHub
repositories. Furthermore, we present a unified evaluation framework with five
complementary metrics, designed to comprehensively assess agent performance on
our benchmark. We evaluate state-of-the-art automatic research agents on
FML-bench, and find that agents employing broad research exploration strategies
outperform those focusing on narrow but deep exploration. These findings
suggest that emphasizing the breadth of exploration may lead to more effective
research outcomes than focusing solely on incremental refinement. Our benchmark

TL;DR: 本研究通过分析TED演讲，发现内容创作者与观众偏好之间存在持续不匹配，且时间动态对观众参与度的影响比主题内容更重要，挑战了内容特征是流行度主要驱动因素的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数字服务经济中，理解什么驱动流行度至关重要。现有研究主要强调内容特征的作用，但创作者经常误判观众真正重视的内容。

Method: 应用潜在狄利克雷分配(LDA)模型分析大量TED演讲语料，将平台视为数字服务提供的案例，比较创作者的专题供应与观众参与表达的需求。

Result: 识别出创作者提供与消费者偏好之间的持续不匹配，纵向分析显示时间动态对消费者参与度的影响比专题内容更强。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了内容特征是流行度主要驱动因素的假设，强调了时间和情境因素在塑造消费者反应中的重要性，为数字平台上的消费者注意力动态提供了新见解。

Abstract: Understanding what drives popularity is critical in today's digital service
economy, where content creators compete for consumer attention. Prior studies
have primarily emphasized the role of content features, yet creators often
misjudge what audiences actually value. This study applies Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA) modeling to a large corpus of TED Talks, treating the platform
as a case of digital service provision in which creators (speakers) and
consumers (audiences) interact. By comparing the thematic supply of creators
with the demand expressed in audience engagement, we identify persistent
mismatches between producer offerings and consumer preferences. Our
longitudinal analysis further reveals that temporal dynamics exert a stronger
influence on consumer engagement than thematic content, suggesting that when
content is delivered may matter more than what is delivered. These findings
challenge the dominant assumption that content features are the primary drivers

*A H M Rezaul Karim,Ozlem Uzuner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于通用LLaMA-4 17B模型的医疗订单提取方法，在MEDIQA-OE 2025共享任务中排名第5，证明了非领域特定大语言模型通过有效提示工程可以成为临床NLP任务的强基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗订单提取对于结构化临床信息、支持决策制定和实现下游应用（如文档记录和工作流自动化）至关重要。该任务需要从多样化的医疗数据源中提取结构化订单信息。

Method: 使用通用指令调优的LLaMA-4 17B模型，不进行领域特定微调，仅通过单个上下文示例进行指导，采用少样本配置。

Result: 在17个参赛团队的105个提交中排名第5，平均F1得分为37.76，在原因和来源准确性方面有显著改进。

Conclusion: 研究表明，大型非领域特定LLM与有效的提示工程相结合，可以为专业临床NLP任务提供强大且可扩展的基线解决方案。

Abstract: Medical order extraction is essential for structuring actionable clinical
information, supporting decision-making, and enabling downstream applications
such as documentation and workflow automation. Orders may be embedded in
diverse sources, including electronic health records, discharge summaries, and
multi-turn doctor-patient dialogues, and can span categories such as
medications, laboratory tests, imaging studies, and follow-up actions. The
MEDIQA-OE 2025 shared task focuses on extracting structured medical orders from
extended conversational transcripts, requiring the identification of order
type, description, reason, and provenance. We present the MasonNLP submission,
which ranked 5th among 17 participating teams with 105 total submissions. Our
approach uses a general-purpose, instruction-tuned LLaMA-4 17B model without
domain-specific fine-tuning, guided by a single in-context example. This
few-shot configuration achieved an average F1 score of 37.76, with notable
improvements in reason and provenance accuracy. These results demonstrate that
large, non-domain-specific LLMs, when paired with effective prompt engineering,
can serve as strong, scalable baselines for specialized clinical NLP tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过后训练技术扩展扩散LLMs上下文窗口的方法，无需从头训练，实现了128K令牌的上下文长度，在长上下文任务中显著优于无训练基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散LLMs在各种下游任务中展现出巨大潜力，但其长上下文行为尚未得到充分探索，需要开发有效的上下文扩展技术。

Method: 通过简单修改标准RoPE位置编码来适应扩散过程的概率建模，比较不同的掩码策略对优化稳定性和长距离回忆的影响，提出UltraLLaDA模型。

Result: UltraLLaDA在长上下文任务中显著优于无训练基线，实现了128K令牌上下文窗口的稳定扩展。

Conclusion: 特殊的位置编码扩展是扩展扩散LLMs上下文的关键因素，为从业者通过高效后训练实现128K规模上下文提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Diffusion LLMs have attracted growing interest, with plenty of recent work
emphasizing their great potential in various downstream tasks; yet the
long-context behavior of diffusion LLMs remains largely uncharted. We present a
case study of post-training techniques for extending the context window of
diffusion LLMs (i.e., LLaDA) without retraining from scratch. We show that a
simple modification to the standard Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE)
extension effectively accommodates the probabilistic modeling inherent in the
diffusion process, enabling stable scaling to longer context ranges. We further
compare masking strategies used during post-training and analyze their impact
on optimization stability and long-range recall. Instantiating these insights,
we introduce UltraLLaDA, a diffusion LLM with a 128K-token context window that,
in our empirical evaluation on long-context tasks, significantly outperforms
training-free baselines. Our experimental results highlight the special
positional extension as a key lever for scaling diffusion LLMs to extended
contexts and offer practical guidance for practitioners seeking 128K-scale
context via efficient post-training.

TL;DR: 提出VOLTAGE方法，一种基于对比学习的OCR技术，用于低资源语言的数字保护，在Takri文字上达到95%印刷体和87%手写体识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球7000种语言中有2500种濒危，语言消失导致传统智慧、民间文学和社区本质的丧失，低资源语言尤其面临灭绝风险，缺乏无监督OCR方法是阻碍其数字包容的主要原因。

Method: 采用对比学习方法，利用自动字形特征推荐进行基于聚类的标注，通过图像变换和生成对抗网络增强标注数据的多样性和数量。

Result: 在Takri文字上实现95%的印刷体识别准确率和87%的手写体识别准确率，并在其他印度文字上验证了方法的通用性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了低资源语言的OCR问题，为濒危语言的数字保护提供了可行方案，并通过下游用例展示了实际应用价值。

Abstract: UNESCO has classified 2500 out of 7000 languages spoken worldwide as
endangered. Attrition of a language leads to loss of traditional wisdom, folk
literature, and the essence of the community that uses it. It is therefore
imperative to bring digital inclusion to these languages and avoid its
extinction. Low resource languages are at a greater risk of extinction. Lack of
unsupervised Optical Character Recognition(OCR) methodologies for low resource
languages is one of the reasons impeding their digital inclusion. We propose
VOLTAGE - a contrastive learning based OCR methodology, leveraging auto-glyph
feature recommendation for cluster-based labelling. We augment the labelled
data for diversity and volume using image transformations and Generative
Adversarial Networks. Voltage has been designed using Takri - a family of
scripts used in 16th to 20th century in the Himalayan regions of India. We
present results for Takri along with other Indic scripts (both low and high
resource) to substantiate the universal behavior of the methodology. An
accuracy of 95% for machine printed and 87% for handwritten samples on Takri
script has been achieved. We conduct baseline and ablation studies along with
building downstream use cases for Takri, demonstrating the usefulness of our
work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型的分步推理过程带来高昂的计算成本和延迟，阻碍实际部署，需要在不损失准确性的前提下减少推理长度

Method: AdvPrompt迭代优化框架，从多角度生成高质量对抗提示，将开源和闭源模型都视为黑盒通信器

Result: 在多个基准测试中，AdvPrompt平均减少40%的token使用量，在GSM8K上实现3倍响应长度缩减，在MATH-500上为Claude-3.7和Gemini-2.5分别减少35%和47%的token使用

Conclusion: AdvPrompt展示了黑盒提示作为提升大型推理模型效率的实用有效策略，具有良好的泛化能力

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
tackling complex reasoning tasks through step-by-step thinking. However, such a
lengthy reasoning process incurs substantial computational and latency
overheads, hindering the practical deployment of these models. In this work, we
present a new perspective on mitigating overthinking in LRMs via black-box
adversarial prompting. By treating both open-source LRMs and closed-source APIs
as black-box communicators, we investigate how to elicit concise responses
without sacrificing accuracy. We introduce AdvPrompt, an iterative refinement
framework that generates high-quality adversarial prompts from diverse
perspectives. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that AdvPrompt
consistently reduces token usage while preserving performance. Notably,
AdvPrompt achieves a 3x reduction in average response length on simple GSM8K
questions for the Qwen3 model series, and delivers an average ~40% token
reduction across four benchmarks. For closed-source APIs, AdvPrompt reduces
token usage on MATH-500 by 35% for Claude-3.7 and 47% for Gemini-2.5. Further
analysis reveals the generalizability of AdvPrompt across various model scales
and families, underscoring the potential of black-box prompting as a practical
and effective strategy for enhancing LRM efficiency.

TL;DR: AuthenHallu是首个基于真实LLM-人类对话构建的幻觉检测基准，相比人工构造的基准更能反映实际使用中的幻觉特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉检测基准多为人工构造，无法真实反映LLM在实际使用中的幻觉特征，需要构建基于真实对话的基准。

Method: 从真实的LLM-人类对话中筛选并标注样本，构建AuthenHallu基准，并分析不同领域的幻觉发生率。

Result: 基准中31.4%的查询-响应对存在幻觉，在数学和数字问题等挑战性领域这一比例高达60.0%。使用普通LLM作为检测器的效果在现实场景中仍不足。

Conclusion: 基于真实对话的基准能更准确反映LLM幻觉特征，当前LLM作为幻觉检测器的性能仍需提升。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in sensitive domains
such as medicine and law, hallucination detection has become a critical task.
Although numerous benchmarks have been proposed to advance research in this
area, most of them are artificially constructed--either through deliberate
hallucination induction or simulated interactions--rather than derived from
genuine LLM-human dialogues. Consequently, these benchmarks fail to fully
capture the characteristics of hallucinations that occur in real-world usage.
To address this limitation, we introduce AuthenHallu, the first hallucination
detection benchmark built entirely from authentic LLM-human interactions. For
AuthenHallu, we select and annotate samples from genuine LLM-human dialogues,
thereby providing a faithful reflection of how LLMs hallucinate in everyday
user interactions. Statistical analysis shows that hallucinations occur in
31.4% of the query-response pairs in our benchmark, and this proportion
increases dramatically to 60.0% in challenging domains such as Math & Number
Problems. Furthermore, we explore the potential of using vanilla LLMs
themselves as hallucination detectors and find that, despite some promise,
their current performance remains insufficient in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: BitMar是一个量化多模态transformer，使用1.58位编码器和外部情景记忆，在资源受限的边缘设备上实现高效的图像-文本生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决交叉注意力transformer等多模态模型在边缘设备部署时面临的内存和计算资源限制问题，同时结合记忆增强架构的优势。

Method: 采用1.58位BitNet风格文本编码器和DiNOv2视觉编码器创建紧凑嵌入，通过固定大小的键值情景记忆进行查询，解码器使用逐层条件化和滑动窗口注意力机制。

Result: 在低延迟和小模型占用下实现了具有竞争力的图像描述和多模态理解性能，达到了良好的质量-速度权衡。

Conclusion: BitMar通过量化编码器、外部记忆和高效注意力机制的组合，非常适合边缘部署，为资源受限环境提供了可行的多模态生成解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-attention transformers and other multimodal vision-language models
excel at grounding and generation; however, their extensive, full-precision
backbones make it challenging to deploy them on edge devices. Memory-augmented
architectures enhance the utilization of past context; however, most works
rarely pair them with aggressive edge-oriented quantization. We introduce
BitMar, a quantized multimodal transformer that proposes an external human-like
episodic memory for effective image-text generation on hardware with limited
resources. BitMar utilizes 1.58-bit encoders, one for text (BitNet-style) and
one for vision (DiNOv2-based), to create compact embeddings that are combined
and used to query a fixed-size key-value episodic memory. During vector
retrieval, the BitNet decoder applies per-layer conditioning, which increases
the contextual relevance of generated content. The decoder also employs
attention sinks with a sliding-window mechanism to process long or streaming
inputs under tight memory budgets. The combination of per-layer conditioning
and sliding-window attention achieves a strong quality-speed trade-off,
delivering competitive captioning and multimodal understanding at low latency
with a small model footprint. These characteristics make BitMar well-suited for
edge deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于时序大语言模型的动态主题演化建模框架，通过时间衰减函数和注意力机制捕捉不同时期主题变化，在潜在主题空间中使用状态转移矩阵描述主题动态演化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主题模型难以有效捕捉主题随时间变化的动态特性，需要统一建模语义表示和时间演化，提高主题连贯性、多样性和时间稳定性。

Method: 使用大语言模型获取文本上下文嵌入，引入时间衰减函数和注意力机制调整语义单元重要性，在潜在主题空间应用状态转移矩阵描述主题演化，通过联合优化目标约束语义建模和时间一致性。

Result: 在真实语料上的实验表明，该框架能有效捕捉主题的生成、扩展和衰退过程，在多个指标上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为理解大规模文本中的动态语义模式提供了系统性解决方案，丰富了主题建模研究范式，支持多领域复杂文本分析任务。

Abstract: This paper proposes a modeling framework for dynamic topic evolution based on
temporal large language models. The method first uses a large language model to
obtain contextual embeddings of text and then introduces a temporal decay
function and an attention mechanism. These components allow the model to adjust
the importance of semantic units according to time intervals and capture topic
variations across different periods. The temporal representations are then
mapped into a latent topic space, where a state transition matrix is applied to
describe the dynamic evolution of topics. A joint optimization objective
constrains both semantic modeling and temporal consistency, ensuring diversity
and smoothness in topic generation. The design emphasizes the unified modeling
of semantic representation and temporal evolution, which improves topic
coherence and diversity while enhancing stability and interpretability over
time. Experiments on real-world corpora show that the framework effectively
captures the generation, expansion, and decline of topics and outperforms
existing models across multiple metrics. Overall, the proposed method provides
a systematic solution for understanding dynamic semantic patterns in
large-scale text, enriches the research paradigm of topic modeling, and
supports complex text analysis tasks in multiple domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究较少系统探索校准数据如何影响压缩后LLM的能力，特别是在复杂推理能力方面，需要从数据组成属性和领域对应角度进行更深入分析。

Method: 从激活模式角度分析校准数据的影响机制，探索其对数学问题解决和代码生成等高级推理能力的影响，并提出基于激活空间代表性和多样性的校准数据筛选框架。

Result: 发现激活空间的代表性和多样性更根本地决定了校准数据的质量，提出的数据筛选框架能够提升现有后训练压缩方法在保留关键LLM能力方面的性能。

Conclusion: 校准数据的质量对LLM压缩后能力保持至关重要，激活空间的代表性和多样性是评估校准数据质量的关键指标，提出的筛选框架能有效提升压缩性能。

Abstract: Post-training compression has been a widely employed approach to scale down
large language model (LLM) and facilitate efficient inference. In various
proposed compression methods, including pruning and quantization, calibration
data plays a vital role by informing the weight importance and activation
dynamic ranges. However, how calibration data impacts the LLM capability after
compression is less explored. Few of the existing works, though recognizing the
significance of this study, only investigate the language modeling or
commonsense reasoning performance degradation from limited angles, like the
data sources or sample amounts. More systematic research is still needed to
examine the impacts on different LLM capabilities in terms of compositional
properties and domain correspondence of calibration data. In this work, we aim
at bridging this gap and further analyze underlying influencing mechanisms from
the activation pattern perspective. Especially, we explore the calibration
data's impacts on high-level complex reasoning capabilities, like math problem
solving and code generation. Delving into the underlying mechanism, we find
that the representativeness and diversity in activation space more
fundamentally determine the quality of calibration data. Finally, we propose a
calibration data curation framework based on such observations and analysis,
enhancing the performance of existing post-training compression methods on
preserving critical LLM capabilities. Our code is provided in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究事实陈述如何通过外部来源或证据获得可信度，弥补现有研究仅关注声明检测和验证的不足。

Method: 创建FactAppeal数据集，包含跨度级标注，识别事实陈述及其依赖的来源，标注来源类型、名称、角色、认识论凭证等细粒度特征。使用2B-9B参数范围的编码器和生成解码器模型进行建模。

Conclusion: FactAppeal数据集和提出的任务为理解事实陈述的可信度建立提供了新视角，模型在识别认识论结构和证据基础方面表现良好。

Abstract: How is a factual claim made credible? We propose the novel task of Epistemic
Appeal Identification, which identifies whether and how factual statements have
been anchored by external sources or evidence. To advance research on this
task, we present FactAppeal, a manually annotated dataset of 3,226
English-language news sentences. Unlike prior resources that focus solely on
claim detection and verification, FactAppeal identifies the nuanced epistemic
structures and evidentiary basis underlying these claims and used to support
them. FactAppeal contains span-level annotations which identify factual
statements and mentions of sources on which they rely. Moreover, the
annotations include fine-grained characteristics of factual appeals such as the
type of source (e.g. Active Participant, Witness, Expert, Direct Evidence),
whether it is mentioned by name, mentions of the source's role and epistemic
credentials, attribution to the source via direct or indirect quotation, and
other features. We model the task with a range of encoder models and generative
decoder models in the 2B-9B parameter range. Our best performing model, based
on Gemma 2 9B, achieves a macro-F1 score of 0.73.

Motivation: 虽然媒体偏见被广泛研究，但事实报道背后的认知策略在计算层面尚未充分探索。本研究旨在量化不同党派媒体如何通过系统性不同的认知策略来构建现实。

Method: 采用文章匹配策略比较同一事件的报道，应用FactAppeal框架分析47万篇关于COVID-19疫情和以色列-哈马斯战争的文章，隔离报道风格与主题选择的影响。

Result: CNN的报道包含更多事实陈述且更倾向于引用外部来源，主要引用专家和专家文件构建正式权威；福克斯新闻则偏爱新闻报道和直接引用。

Conclusion: 这项研究量化了党派媒体如何使用系统性不同的认知策略来构建现实，为媒体偏见研究增添了新的维度。

Abstract: While media bias is widely studied, the epistemic strategies behind factual
reporting remain computationally underexplored. This paper analyzes these
strategies through a large-scale comparison of CNN and Fox News. To isolate
reporting style from topic selection, we employ an article matching strategy to
compare reports on the same events and apply the FactAppeal framework to a
corpus of over 470K articles covering two highly politicized periods: the
COVID-19 pandemic and the Israel-Hamas war. We find that CNN's reporting
contains more factual statements and is more likely to ground them in external
sources. The outlets also exhibit sharply divergent sourcing patterns: CNN
builds credibility by citing Experts} and Expert Documents, constructing an
appeal to formal authority, whereas Fox News favors News Reports and direct
quotations. This work quantifies how partisan outlets use systematically
different epistemic strategies to construct reality, adding a new dimension to
the study of media bias.

Motivation: 传统的单体架构在复杂推理和多样化数据库模式方面存在困难，需要更灵活和可解释的解决方案。

Method: 采用多专家代理框架，包括推理代理进行问题分解、编码代理生成子查询、优化步骤进行列选择，并引入自适应路由器在模块化流程和基线解析器之间进行选择。

Result: 在Spider基准测试中，使用14B参数模型通过Planner&Executor合并策略达到86.07%的执行准确率，接近GPT-4的89.65% SOTA性能。

Conclusion: AGENTIQL不仅提高了准确率，还通过展示中间推理步骤增强了透明度，为语义解析提供了鲁棒、可扩展和可解释的方法。

Abstract: LLMs have advanced text-to-SQL generation, yet monolithic architectures
struggle with complex reasoning and schema diversity. We propose AGENTIQL, an
agent-inspired multi-expert framework that combines a reasoning agent for
question decomposition, a coding agent for sub-query generation, and a
refinement step for column selection. An adaptive router further balances
efficiency and accuracy by selecting between our modular pipeline and a
baseline parser. Several steps in the pipeline can be executed in parallel,
making the framework scalable to larger workloads. Evaluated on the Spider
benchmark, AGENTIQL improves execution accuracy and interpretability and
achieves up to 86.07\% EX with 14B models using the Planner&Executor merging
strategy. The attained performance is contingent upon the efficacy of the
routing mechanism, thereby narrowing the gap to GPT-4-based SOTA (89.65% EX)
while using much smaller open-source LLMs. Beyond accuracy, AGENTIQL enhances
transparency by exposing intermediate reasoning steps, offering a robust,
scalable, and interpretable approach to semantic parsing.

TL;DR: BrowserAgent是一个基于人类浏览行为的交互式网络代理，通过模拟点击、滚动、输入等浏览器操作直接处理原始网页，在多项开放QA任务中表现优于Search-R1。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如Search-R1和WebDancer依赖工具将动态网页转换为静态文本，这与人类多样化的浏览器交互行为不符，需要更接近人类浏览方式的交互式代理。

Method: 采用两阶段训练（监督微调和拒绝微调），通过Playwright预定义的浏览器操作直接处理原始网页，并引入显式记忆机制存储关键结论。

Result: 尽管训练数据远少于Search-R1，但在HotpotQA、2Wiki和Bamboogle等多跳QA任务上取得约20%的性能提升，在开放QA任务中表现更具竞争力。

Conclusion: BrowserAgent可作为更先进、交互性更强且可扩展的网络代理框架，通过人类启发的浏览器操作有效解决复杂任务。

Abstract: Efficiently solving real-world problems with LLMs increasingly hinges on
their ability to interact with dynamic web environments and autonomously
acquire external information. While recent research like Search-R1 and
WebDancer demonstrates strong performance in solving web tasks, they heavily
rely on additional tools to convert the interactive web environment into static
text content. This is in contrast to human browsing behaviors, which involve
diverse interactions with the browser, such as scrolling, clicking, and typing.
In this paper, we propose BrowserAgent, a more interactive agent that solves
complex tasks through human-inspired browser actions. BrowserAgent operates
directly on raw web pages via Playwright through a set of predefined browser
actions. We adopt a two-stage training (Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT)) to improve the model's generalization abilities.
Despite using significantly less training data than Search-R1, BrowserAgent
achieves more competitive results across different Open-QA tasks. Additionally,
we introduce an explicit memory mechanism to store key conclusions across
steps, further enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities for long-horizon
tasks. Notably, BrowserAgent-7B can achieve around 20\% improvement over
Search-R1 on multi-hop QA tasks like HotpotQA, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle. These
results indicate that BrowserAgent can serve as a more advanced framework for
more interactive and scalable web agents.

Conclusion: ConsistentGuard方法有效解决了现有LLM保护方法的局限性，提供了多语言基准扩展并开源代码以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have enhanced AI capabilities, but also increased the
risk posed by malicious requests, highlighting the need for effective LLM
safeguards to detect such queries. Existing approaches largely rely on
classifier-based methods that lack interpretability and perform poorly on
low-resource languages. To address these limitations, we propose
ConsistentGuard, a novel reasoning-based multilingual safeguard, which enhances
explainability via reasoning and boosts knowledge transfer between languages
through alignment. With only 1,000 training samples, our method demonstrates
superior performance on three datasets across six languages, outperforming
larger models trained with significantly more data, and exhibits strong
interpretability and generalization ability. We also contribute a multilingual

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: High-quality pretraining data is the fossil fuel of large language models
(LLMs), yet its reserves are running low for frontier models. In this paper, we
introduce RePro, a novel web recycling method that trains a relatively small LM
with reinforcement learning to generate effective and faithful rephrasings of
pretraining data. Specifically, we design one quality reward and three
faithfulness rewards, optimizing the LM rephraser to convert organic data into
high-quality rephrasings while maintaining its core semantics and structure. In
our experiment, we train a 4B rephraser to recycle 72B tokens sampled from
DCLM-RefinedWeb. Pretraining results on 400M and 1.4B models demonstrate that
RePro delivers 4.7%-14.0% relative accuracy gains over organic-only baseline on
22 downstream tasks. RePro also outperforms ReWire, the state-of-the-art web
recycling method that prompts a 70B rephraser, as well as the organic baseline
with a 4x larger data pool. Experiments with different amounts of recycled data
highlight that RePro improves organic data efficiency by 2-3x. Individual and
distributional analyses validate that RePro preserves more critical information
and faithfully reflects the characteristics of organic data compared to
prompting-based methods. Together, these results show that RePro provides an
efficient and controllable path to effectively harness the fossil fuel of LLM
pretraining. We open-source our code, rephraser, and recycled data at

TL;DR: 提出了一个模块化深度学习框架用于讽刺检测，结合DCNN和BERT分析语言、情感和上下文线索


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 讽刺在文本中容易被误解，因为缺乏语调和肢体语言，需要更准确的检测方法

Method: 使用模块化深度学习框架，集成DCNN和BERT模型，结合情感分析、上下文嵌入、语言特征提取和情感检测的多层架构

Result: 模型仍处于概念阶段，但证明了在聊天机器人和社交媒体分析等实际应用中的可行性

Conclusion: 该框架为文本讽刺检测提供了一种可行的多模态分析方法，具有实际应用潜力

Abstract: Sarcasm is a nuanced and often misinterpreted form of communication,
especially in text, where tone and body language are absent. This paper
proposes a modular deep learning framework for sarcasm detection, leveraging
Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) and contextual models such as BERT
to analyze linguistic, emotional, and contextual cues. The system integrates
sentiment analysis, contextual embeddings, linguistic feature extraction, and
emotion detection through a multi-layer architecture. While the model is in the
conceptual stage, it demonstrates feasibility for real-world applications such
as chatbots and social media analysis.

*Wenqing Zhang,Trang Nguyen,Elizabeth A. Stuart,Yiqun T. Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用因果中介分析作为代表性方法领域，评估了最先进的大型语言模型在180篇全文科学文章中的方法学评估表现。模型在明确陈述的方法标准上接近人类准确率，但在复杂推理评估中表现显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统评价对于综合科学证据至关重要，但提取详细方法学信息仍然劳动密集。大型语言模型有望自动化方法学评估，改变证据综合过程。

Method: 使用因果中介分析作为代表性方法领域，将最先进的LLM与专家人类评审员在180篇全文科学文章中进行基准测试。

Result: 模型表现与人类判断密切相关（准确率相关性0.71；F1相关性0.97），在简单明确的方法标准上达到接近人类的准确率。但在复杂推理密集型评估中准确率急剧下降，落后专家评审员达15%。

Conclusion: 当前LLM擅长识别明确的方法特征，但在细致解释时需要人类监督。将自动化信息提取与有针对性的专家评审相结合，为跨学科证据综合提供了提高效率和严谨性的有前景方法。

Abstract: Systematic reviews are crucial for synthesizing scientific evidence but
remain labor-intensive, especially when extracting detailed methodological
information. Large language models (LLMs) offer potential for automating
methodological assessments, promising to transform evidence synthesis. Here,
using causal mediation analysis as a representative methodological domain, we
benchmarked state-of-the-art LLMs against expert human reviewers across 180
full-text scientific articles. Model performance closely correlated with human
judgments (accuracy correlation 0.71; F1 correlation 0.97), achieving
near-human accuracy on straightforward, explicitly stated methodological
criteria. However, accuracy sharply declined on complex, inference-intensive
assessments, lagging expert reviewers by up to 15%. Errors commonly resulted
from superficial linguistic cues -- for instance, models frequently
misinterpreted keywords like "longitudinal" or "sensitivity" as automatic
evidence of rigorous methodological approache, leading to systematic
misclassifications. Longer documents yielded lower model accuracy, whereas
publication year showed no significant effect. Our findings highlight an
important pattern for practitioners using LLMs for methods review and synthesis
from full texts: current LLMs excel at identifying explicit methodological
features but require human oversight for nuanced interpretations. Integrating
automated information extraction with targeted expert review thus provides a
promising approach to enhance efficiency and methodological rigor in evidence
synthesis across diverse scientific fields.

*James Ald Teves,Ray Daniel Cal,Josh Magdiel Villaluz,Jean Malolos,Mico Magtira,Ramon Rodriguez,Mideth Abisado,Joseph Marvin Imperial*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究开发了HiligayNER，这是首个用于希利盖农语命名实体识别的公开基准模型，使用超过8000个标注句子训练，基于mBERT和XLM-RoBERTa模型，性能超过80%，并展示了跨语言迁移能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希利盖农语作为菲律宾代表性语言之一，在语言处理研究中代表性不足，缺乏标注语料库和基准模型，需要开发语言技术来支持低资源语言的NLP研究。

Method: 从公开新闻文章、社交媒体帖子和文学文本收集超过8000个标注句子，使用Transformer模型mBERT和XLM-RoBERTa进行微调，构建HiligayNER模型，并进行跨语言评估。

Result: 两个模型在所有实体类型上都实现了超过80%的精确率、召回率和F1分数，与宿务语和他加禄语的跨语言评估显示出良好的迁移性。

Conclusion: HiligayNER为希利盖农语提供了首个NER基准模型，展示了在低资源多语言NLP环境中的广泛应用潜力，有助于推动菲律宾代表性不足语言的技术发展。

Abstract: The language of Hiligaynon, spoken predominantly by the people of Panay
Island, Negros Occidental, and Soccsksargen in the Philippines, remains
underrepresented in language processing research due to the absence of
annotated corpora and baseline models. This study introduces HiligayNER, the
first publicly available baseline model for the task of Named Entity
Recognition (NER) in Hiligaynon. The dataset used to build HiligayNER contains
over 8,000 annotated sentences collected from publicly available news articles,
social media posts, and literary texts. Two Transformer-based models, mBERT and
XLM-RoBERTa, were fine-tuned on this collected corpus to build versions of
HiligayNER. Evaluation results show strong performance, with both models
achieving over 80% in precision, recall, and F1-score across entity types.
Furthermore, cross-lingual evaluation with Cebuano and Tagalog demonstrates
promising transferability, suggesting the broader applicability of HiligayNER
for multilingual NLP in low-resource settings. This work aims to contribute to
language technology development for underrepresented Philippine languages,
specifically for Hiligaynon, and support future research in regional language
processing.

*Zhichao Wang,Cheng Wan,Dong Nie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文系统综述了推理时扩展技术，将这一新兴领域组织为输出导向和输入导向两大类方法，旨在通过部署时的额外计算来提升LLM性能，而无需重新训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于高质量训练数据的快速减少构成了根本性瓶颈，研究重点正从训练时扩展转向推理时扩展，利用部署时的额外计算显著提升LLM在下游任务上的性能。

Method: 采用系统综述方法，将推理时扩展技术分为两大类：输出导向方法（包括复杂多步生成策略、推理方法、搜索解码、长CoT训练和模型集成）和输入导向方法（以少样本学习和RAG为核心，RAG部分详细分析了查询扩展、数据、检索重排序、LLM生成方法和多模态RAG）。

Result: 构建了一个全面的推理时扩展技术分类框架，系统梳理了这一快速演进领域的主要技术路线和方法体系。

Conclusion: 推理时扩展代表了LLM发展的新范式，通过部署时的计算优化来突破训练数据瓶颈，为LLM性能提升提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: The performance gains of LLMs have historically been driven by scaling up
model size and training data. However, the rapidly diminishing availability of
high-quality training data is introducing a fundamental bottleneck, shifting
the focus of research toward inference-time scaling. This paradigm uses
additional computation at the time of deployment to substantially improve LLM
performance on downstream tasks without costly model re-training. This review
systematically surveys the diverse techniques contributing to this new era of
inference-time scaling, organizing the rapidly evolving field into two
comprehensive perspectives: Output-focused and Input-focused methods.
Output-focused techniques encompass complex, multi-step generation strategies,
including reasoning (e.g., CoT, ToT, ReAct), various search and decoding
methods (e.g., MCTS, beam search), training for long CoT (e.g., RLVR, GRPO),
and model ensemble methods. Input-focused techniques are primarily categorized
by few-shot and RAG, with RAG as the central focus. The RAG section is further
detailed through a structured examination of query expansion, data, retrieval
and reranker, LLM generation methods, and multi-modal RAG.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为HCRS的五维评估框架，用于评估健康文本简化，该框架结合自动测量和结构化人类反馈，超越传统表面指标如BLEU、FKGL和SARI。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NLP评估指标主要捕捉表面特征，无法衡量人类中心的质量如清晰度、可信度、语气、文化相关性和可操作性，这在高风险健康环境中尤为关键。

Method: 提出了HCRS框架，该框架基于人机交互和健康传播研究，整合自动测量和结构化人类反馈，捕捉可读性的关系和上下文方面。

Result: 提出了框架并讨论了其在参与式评估工作流中的整合，以及经验验证的协议。

Conclusion: 这项工作旨在推进健康文本简化评估，使其超越表面指标，使NLP系统更符合多样化用户的需求、期望和生活经验。

Abstract: Text simplification is essential for making public health information
accessible to diverse populations, including those with limited health
literacy. However, commonly used evaluation metrics in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), such as BLEU, FKGL, and SARI, mainly capture surface-level
features and fail to account for human-centered qualities like clarity,
trustworthiness, tone, cultural relevance, and actionability. This limitation
is particularly critical in high-stakes health contexts, where communication
must be not only simple but also usable, respectful, and trustworthy. To
address this gap, we propose the Human-Centered Readability Score (HCRS), a
five-dimensional evaluation framework grounded in Human-Computer Interaction
(HCI) and health communication research. HCRS integrates automatic measures
with structured human feedback to capture the relational and contextual aspects
of readability. We outline the framework, discuss its integration into
participatory evaluation workflows, and present a protocol for empirical
validation. This work aims to advance the evaluation of health text
simplification beyond surface metrics, enabling NLP systems that align more
closely with diverse users' needs, expectations, and lived experiences.

*Mihir Gupte,Paolo Giusto,Ramesh S*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的自底向上方法，将树状结构（如GitHub仓库）的知识线性化，通过在每个层次生成隐式聚合摘要，用于RAG系统，显著减少了检索器中的文档数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何最好地表示检索到的知识，以便在结构化数据（特别是树状层次结构）上生成响应，因为现有方法在这方面研究不足。

Method: 采用自底向上方法，从树状结构的每个层次生成隐式聚合摘要，将知识线性化后存储在知识库中，直接用于RAG系统。

Result: 与使用原始非结构化代码的RAG相比，响应质量相当，但检索器中的文档数量减少了68%以上，效率显著提升。

Conclusion: 利用隐式线性化知识可能是处理复杂层次数据结构的有效且可扩展策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are adept at generating responses based on
information within their context. While this ability is useful for interacting
with structured data like code files, another popular method,
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), retrieves relevant documents to augment
the model's in-context learning. However, it is not well-explored how to best
represent this retrieved knowledge for generating responses on structured data,
particularly hierarchical structures like trees. In this work, we propose a
novel bottom-up method to linearize knowledge from tree-like structures (like a
GitHub repository) by generating implicit, aggregated summaries at each
hierarchical level. This approach enables the knowledge to be stored in a
knowledge base and used directly with RAG. We then compare our method to using
RAG on raw, unstructured code, evaluating the accuracy and quality of the
generated responses. Our results show that while response quality is comparable
across both methods, our approach generates over 68% fewer documents in the
retriever, a significant gain in efficiency. This finding suggests that
leveraging implicit, linearized knowledge may be a highly effective and
scalable strategy for handling complex, hierarchical data structures.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了音译在跨语言NLP中的作用，发现罗马化音译在大多数评估设置中表现最佳，主要原因是能够与预训练语言共享更长的子词标记。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同音译方法（罗马化、音位转录、替代密码）和正字法在跨语言NLP中的效果，探索共享脚本、重叠词汇和共享音系对多语言模型性能的贡献程度。

Method: 使用三种音译方法（罗马化、音位转录、替代密码）和正字法进行受控实验，在命名实体识别（NER）和自然语言推理（NLI）两个下游任务上评估每种模型。

Result: 在8个评估设置中，罗马化在7个设置中显著优于其他输入类型，验证了其作为最有效方法的假设。

Conclusion: 罗马化音译是最有效的跨语言处理方法，其成功主要源于能够与预训练语言共享更长的子词标记，从而更好地利用模型能力。

Abstract: Transliteration has emerged as a promising means to bridge the gap between
various languages in multilingual NLP, showing promising results especially for
languages using non-Latin scripts. We investigate the degree to which shared
script, overlapping token vocabularies, and shared phonology contribute to
performance of multilingual models. To this end, we conduct controlled
experiments using three kinds of transliteration (romanization, phonemic
transcription, and substitution ciphers) as well as orthography. We evaluate
each model on two downstream tasks -- named entity recognition (NER) and
natural language inference (NLI) -- and find that romanization significantly
outperforms other input types in 7 out of 8 evaluation settings, largely
consistent with our hypothesis that it is the most effective approach. We
further analyze how each factor contributed to the success, and suggest that
having longer (subword) tokens shared with pre-trained languages leads to
better utilization of the model.

### [312] [DUAL-Bench: Measuring Over-Refusal and Robustness in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10846)
*Kaixuan Ren,Preslav Nakov,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DUAL-Bench，首个专注于多模态模型中过度拒绝和安全完成行为的基准测试，评估了18个视觉语言模型在12个危险类别中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在安全性和实用性之间难以平衡，安全机制可能导致过度拒绝，而现有基准未能系统性地解决视觉模态中的这一问题。

Method: 构建DUAL-Bench基准，包含双重使用场景，评估模型在语义保持的视觉扰动下的鲁棒性，重点关注安全完成行为。

Result: 模型表现普遍不佳：GPT-5-Nano安全完成率为12.9%，GPT-5模型平均7.9%，Qwen模型仅3.9%，显示有显著改进空间。

Conclusion: DUAL-Bench将促进更精细的对齐策略发展，确保模型在复杂多模态环境中既安全又实用。

Abstract: As vision-language models become increasingly capable, maintaining a balance
between safety and usefulness remains a central challenge. Safety mechanisms,
while essential, can backfire, causing over-refusal, where models decline
benign requests out of excessive caution. Yet, no existing benchmark has
systematically addressed over-refusal in the visual modality. This setting
introduces unique challenges, such as dual-use cases where an instruction is
harmless, but the accompanying image contains harmful content. Models
frequently fail in such scenarios, either refusing too conservatively or
completing tasks unsafely, which highlights the need for more fine-grained
alignment. The ideal behavior is safe completion, i.e., fulfilling the benign
parts of a request while explicitly warning about any potentially harmful
elements. To address this, we present DUAL-Bench, the first multimodal
benchmark focused on over-refusal and safe completion in VLMs. We evaluated 18
VLMs across 12 hazard categories, with focus on their robustness under
semantics-preserving visual perturbations. The results reveal substantial room
for improvement: GPT-5-Nano achieves 12.9% safe completion, GPT-5 models
average 7.9%, and Qwen models only 3.9%. We hope that DUAL-Bench will foster
the development of more nuanced alignment strategies that ensure models remain
both safe and useful in complex multimodal settings.

TL;DR: 本文评估了六种轻量级测试时扩展策略和四种LLM（包括两种推理模型）在BIRD Mini-Dev基准上的Text-to-SQL性能，发现分治提示和少样本演示能持续提升性能，但额外工作流程步骤效果不一，基础模型选择至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然测试时扩展策略在基于LLM的解决方案中显示出潜力，但其在真实世界应用中的有效性，特别是与最新推理模型结合时，仍不确定。本文旨在评估这些策略在工业环境中的实际表现。

Method: 在BIRD Mini-Dev基准上对六种轻量级、面向工业的测试时扩展策略和四种LLM（包括两种推理模型）进行基准测试，除了标准准确率指标外，还报告推理延迟和令牌消耗。

Result: 分治提示和少样本演示能持续提升通用和推理型LLM的性能，但引入额外工作流程步骤效果不一，基础模型选择对结果有重要影响。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了在部署Text-to-SQL系统时，准确率、效率和复杂性之间的实际权衡关系。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly powering Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL)
systems, enabling non-expert users to query industrial databases using natural
language. While test-time scaling strategies have shown promise in LLM-based
solutions, their effectiveness in real-world applications, especially with the
latest reasoning models, remains uncertain. In this work, we benchmark six
lightweight, industry-oriented test-time scaling strategies and four LLMs,
including two reasoning models, evaluating their performance on the BIRD
Mini-Dev benchmark. Beyond standard accuracy metrics, we also report inference
latency and token consumption, providing insights relevant for practical system
deployment. Our findings reveal that Divide-and-Conquer prompting and few-shot
demonstrations consistently enhance performance for both general-purpose and
reasoning-focused LLMs. However, introducing additional workflow steps yields
mixed results, and base model selection plays a critical role. This work sheds
light on the practical trade-offs between accuracy, efficiency, and complexity
when deploying Text2SQL systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于先前工作LLM x MapReduce-V2，构建更灵活、可控的综述生成系统，通过模块化分解支持人工干预和定制化研究过程。

Method: 采用多代理架构，将骨架初始化、摘要构建、骨架优化等功能组件实现为独立的MCP服务器，这些服务器可聚合成更高层次服务器；高层规划代理根据MCP工具描述和执行历史动态编排工作流。

Result: 通过多轮交互精确捕捉研究视角生成全面骨架，进而发展为深度综述；人工评估显示系统在内容深度和长度上均优于代表性基线方法。

Conclusion: 基于MCP的模块化规划方法在长篇综述生成任务中表现出色，验证了层次化模块化代理系统的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce LLM x MapReduce-V3, a hierarchically modular agent system
designed for long-form survey generation. Building on the prior work, LLM x
MapReduce-V2, this version incorporates a multi-agent architecture where
individual functional components, such as skeleton initialization, digest
construction, and skeleton refinement, are implemented as independent
model-context-protocol (MCP) servers. These atomic servers can be aggregated
into higher-level servers, creating a hierarchically structured system. A
high-level planner agent dynamically orchestrates the workflow by selecting
appropriate modules based on their MCP tool descriptions and the execution
history. This modular decomposition facilitates human-in-the-loop intervention,
affording users greater control and customization over the research process.
Through a multi-turn interaction, the system precisely captures the intended
research perspectives to generate a comprehensive skeleton, which is then
developed into an in-depth survey. Human evaluations demonstrate that our
system surpasses representative baselines in both content depth and length,
highlighting the strength of MCP-based modular planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然能够用自然语言表达置信度，但经常表现出过度自信，其原因尚不清楚。

Method: 提出ADVICE（答案依赖的置信度估计）微调框架，促进基于答案的置信度估计。

Result: 实验表明ADVICE显著改善了置信度校准，同时保持了任务性能。分析确认ADVICE增强了答案基础性，产生了更平衡和校准良好的置信度分布。

Conclusion: 揭示了过度自信的根源，并建立了更可信的置信度表达框架。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled them to express
their confidence in natural language, enhancing transparency and reliability.
However, their confidence often exhibits overconfidence, the cause of which
remains poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a detailed analysis of the
dynamics underlying verbalized confidence and identify answer-independence as a
key factor, defined as the model's failure to condition confidence on its own
answer. To address this, we propose ADVICE (Answer-Dependent Verbalized
Confidence Estimation), a fine-tuning framework that facilitates
answer-grounded confidence estimation. Extensive experiments show that ADVICE
substantially improves confidence calibration while preserving task
performance. Further analyses confirm that ADVICE strengthens
answer-groundedness, leading to more balanced and well-calibrated confidence
distributions. Our findings shed light on the origin of overconfidence and
establish a framework for more trustworthy confidence verbalization.

TL;DR: 提出GapDNER模型，通过将上下文间隙作为特殊span类型，使用网格标注方法解决不连续命名实体识别中的解码模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学领域中，命名实体常由非相邻token组成且与其他实体重叠。现有方法通过连接实体片段或内部token面临错误传播和解码模糊的挑战。

Method: 将上下文间隙作为额外span类型，将span分类转换为token-pair网格标注任务。设计两个交互组件：内部规律提取模块使用双仿射机制和线性注意力捕获每个span内部规律；跨span关系增强模块使用交叉注意力获取不同span间的语义关系。推理时使用BFS算法搜索有效路径。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验结果表明，GapDNER在不连续NER任务上达到了新的最先进性能，在识别复杂实体结构方面表现出显著优势。

Conclusion: GapDNER通过创新性地对上下文间隙进行表示学习，有效解决了不连续NER中的解码模糊问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: In biomedical fields, one named entity may consist of a series of
non-adjacent tokens and overlap with other entities. Previous methods recognize
discontinuous entities by connecting entity fragments or internal tokens, which
face challenges of error propagation and decoding ambiguity due to the wide
variety of span or word combinations. To address these issues, we deeply
explore discontinuous entity structures and propose an effective Gap-aware grid
tagging model for Discontinuous Named Entity Recognition, named GapDNER. Our
GapDNER innovatively applies representation learning on the context gaps
between entity fragments to resolve decoding ambiguity and enhance
discontinuous NER performance. Specifically, we treat the context gap as an
additional type of span and convert span classification into a token-pair grid
tagging task. Subsequently, we design two interactive components to
comprehensively model token-pair grid features from both intra- and inter-span
perspectives. The intra-span regularity extraction module employs the biaffine
mechanism along with linear attention to capture the internal regularity of
each span, while the inter-span relation enhancement module utilizes
criss-cross attention to obtain semantic relations among different spans. At
the inference stage of entity decoding, we assign a directed edge to each
entity fragment and context gap, then use the BFS algorithm to search for all
valid paths from the head to tail of grids with entity tags. Experimental
results on three datasets demonstrate that our GapDNER achieves new
state-of-the-art performance on discontinuous NER and exhibits remarkable
advantages in recognizing complex entity structures.

TL;DR: 本文提出评估AI系统对游戏评估能力的新范式，通过比较推理模型、语言模型与人类在游戏公平性和趣味性评估上的差异，发现推理模型更接近人类判断，但随着模型接近博弈论最优，与人类数据的拟合度反而下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI评估主要关注问题解决能力，而忽视了AI系统评估问题价值的能力。本文旨在建立评估AI系统评估能力的新范式，特别是在游戏评估方面。

Method: 使用包含100多个新颖棋盘游戏和450多个人类判断的大规模数据集，比较现代语言模型、推理模型与人类在游戏公平性和趣味性评估上的表现。

Result: 推理模型在游戏评估上比非推理语言模型更接近人类判断，但存在非单调关系：模型越接近博弈论最优，与人类数据的拟合度越弱。评估趣味性时模型表现更不稳定，推理模型在资源使用上表现出高度可变性。

Conclusion: 需要在语言和推理模型中注入更多资源理性的元推理能力，以提高评估的稳定性和可预测性。

Abstract: Reasoning is not just about solving problems -- it is also about evaluating
which problems are worth solving at all. Evaluations of artificial intelligence
(AI) systems primarily focused on problem solving, historically by studying how
models play games such as chess and Go. In this paper, we advocate for a new
paradigm that assesses AI systems' evaluation of games. First, we introduce a
formalism for evaluating such evaluations. We then leverage a large-scale
dataset of over $100$ novel board games and over 450 human judgments to compare
evaluations produced by modern language and reasoning models against those of
people and symbolic computational agents. We consider two kinds of evaluative
queries: assessing the payoff (or fairness) and the funness of games. These
queries span two dimensions relevant to the design of evaluations of AI
evaluations: how complex a query is to compute and how difficult a query is to
quantify. Our results show that reasoning models are generally more aligned to
people in their evaluations of games than non-reasoning language models.
However, we observe a non-monotonic relationship: as models get closer to
game-theoretic optimal, their fit to human data weakens. We also observe more
"jaggedness" across models for assessing funness, in line with the greater
difficulty of quantifying this query. Across queries and games, reasoning
models show highly variable and unpredictable resource usage when assessing
queries, pointing to the importance of imbuing more resource-rational
meta-reasoning in language and reasoning models.

Conclusion: 该研究证实了BiLSTM-CNN-CRF架构的优越性，提供了可复现的开源实现，为序列标注研究提供了可靠基准。

Abstract: We present a reproducibility study of the state-of-the-art neural
architecture for sequence labeling proposed by Ma and Hovy
(2016)\cite{ma2016end}. The original BiLSTM-CNN-CRF model combines
character-level representations via Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),
word-level context modeling through Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory
networks (BiLSTMs), and structured prediction using Conditional Random Fields
(CRFs). This end-to-end approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted features
while achieving excellent performance on named entity recognition (NER) and
part-of-speech (POS) tagging tasks. Our implementation successfully reproduces
the key results, achieving 91.18\% F1-score on CoNLL-2003 NER and demonstrating
the model's effectiveness across sequence labeling tasks. We provide a detailed
analysis of the architecture components and release an open-source PyTorch
implementation to facilitate further research.

Method: 开发了一个可复现的流程，在二值化前将标点符号保留为兄弟节点，并提供派生的人工制品、元数据和评估套件。

Result: 在Penn Treebank上，标点感知预处理将头部预测准确率从73.66%（Collins规则）和86.66%（MLP）提升到91.85%，并在CCGbank推导上实现了竞争性的对齐。

Conclusion: 所有代码、配置文件和文档都已发布，支持复现并扩展到其他语料库。

Abstract: This article presents a curated resource and evaluation suite for
punctuation-aware treebank binarization. Standard binarization pipelines drop
punctuation before head selection, which alters constituent shape and harms
head-child identification. We release (1) a reproducible pipeline that
preserves punctuation as sibling nodes prior to binarization, (2) derived
artifacts and metadata (intermediate @X markers, reversibility signatures,
alignment indices), and (3) an accompanying evaluation suite covering
head-child prediction, round-trip reversibility, and structural compatibility
with derivational resources (CCGbank). On the Penn Treebank, punctuation-aware
preprocessing improves head prediction accuracy from 73.66\% (Collins rules)
and 86.66\% (MLP) to 91.85\% with the same classifier, and achieves competitive
alignment against CCGbank derivations. All code, configuration files, and
documentation are released to enable replication and extension to other
corpora.

*Yejin Lee,Su-Hyeon Kim,Hyundong Jin,Dayoung Kim,Yeonsoo Kim,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了KOTOX：首个同时支持韩语去混淆和去毒化的数据集，包含基于韩语语言学特征构建的三个难度级别版本，旨在解决低资源语言中LLM识别和中和混淆有毒内容的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线交流中，有毒内容已成为严重社会问题。现有研究主要关注英语，低资源语言代表性不足，导致LLM难以识别和中和这些语言中的有毒表达，特别是当用户使用混淆技术规避检测系统时。

Method: 基于韩语语言学特征对混淆方法进行分类，定义基于真实示例的转换规则，构建三个不同混淆难度级别的数据集版本（简单、普通、困难）。

Result: 创建了首个同时支持韩语去混淆和去毒化的数据集，包含基于语言学特征构建的三个难度级别版本。

Conclusion: KOTOX数据集有助于更好地理解和减轻低资源语言中LLM对混淆有毒内容处理的挑战，促进相关研究发展。

Abstract: Toxic content has become an increasingly critical social issue with the rapid
expansion of online communication. While numerous studies explored methods for
detecting and detoxifying such content, most have focused primarily on English,
leaving low-resource language underrepresented. Consequently, Large Language
Models~(LLMs) often struggle to identify and neutralize toxic expressions in
these languages. This challenge becomes even more pronounced when user employ
obfuscation techniques to evade detection systems. Therefore, we propose a
\textbf{KOTOX: Korean Toxic Dataset} for deobfuscation and detoxicification to
address this issue. We categorize various obfuscation approaches based on
linguistic characteristics of Korean and define a set of transformation rules
grounded in real-word examples. Using these rules, we construct three dataset
versions (easy, normal, and hard) representing different levels of obfuscation
difficulty. This is the first dataset that simultaneously supports
deobfuscation and detoxification for the Korean language. We expect it to
facilitate better understanding and mitigating of obfuscated toxic content in
LLM for low-resource languages. Our code and data are available at
https://github.com/leeyejin1231/KOTOX.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个自动化构建虚假前提问题基准的方法，创建了JBA数据集，并开发了增强MLLMs识别虚假前提能力的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在虚假前提问题上表现脆弱，现有基准缺乏细粒度分类和足够覆盖范围，无法充分评估模型识别虚假前提的能力。

Method: 使用全自动流水线构建虚假前提问题基准，将前提系统分为3个主要类型和13个子类型，并提出了专门的识别增强框架。

Result: 当前MLLMs在虚假前提识别方面仍然存在困难，但使用提出的增强框架训练的模型在虚假前提识别方面取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 提出的JBA数据集和识别增强框架有效提升了MLLMs识别虚假前提的鲁棒性，为解决这一重要问题提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have witnessed astonishing
advancements in recent years. Despite these successes, MLLMs remain vulnerable
to flase premise problems. However, existing benchmarks targeting this issue
are limited in scope: they often lack fine-grained categorization, exhibit
insufficient coverage, and thus fail to provide a rigorous evaluation of the
ability of models to recognize false premises. To bridge this gap, we introduce
a fully automated pipeline for constructing a comprehensive benchmark of false
premise questions. Our method systematically categorizes the premises into
three main types and thirteen subtypes according to the abilities required to
identify the premises, resulting in the JBA dataset.Results show current MLLMs
still struggle with false premise recognition. Building upon this benchmark, we
further propose a recognition enhancement framework tailored to strengthen the
robustness of MLLMs to detect false premises. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that models trained with our framework achieve significant improvements in
false premise recognition.

*Yejin Lee,Hyeseon Ahn,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了RV-HATE框架，通过强化学习优化多个专门模块的权重，针对不同仇恨言论数据集的特征进行自适应检测，提高检测准确性并提供可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仇恨言论在不同平台和来源的数据集中表现出多样性特征，但现有检测方法往往采用固定方法而不适应数据特定特征。

Method: RV-HATE框架包含多个专门模块，每个模块关注仇恨言论的不同语言或上下文特征，使用强化学习优化模块权重，并通过投票机制聚合模块输出。

Result: 该方法有效处理隐含仇恨言论，相比传统静态方法获得更优越的性能。

Conclusion: RV-HATE通过适应数据集特定特征提高了检测准确性，同时提供了对每个数据集独特特征的可解释性洞察。

Abstract: Hate speech remains prevalent in human society and continues to evolve in its
forms and expressions. Modern advancements in internet and online anonymity
accelerate its rapid spread and complicate its detection. However, hate speech
datasets exhibit diverse characteristics primarily because they are constructed
from different sources and platforms, each reflecting different linguistic
styles and social contexts. Despite this diversity, prior studies on hate
speech detection often rely on fixed methodologies without adapting to
data-specific features. We introduce RV-HATE, a detection framework designed to
account for the dataset-specific characteristics of each hate speech dataset.
RV-HATE consists of multiple specialized modules, where each module focuses on
distinct linguistic or contextual features of hate speech. The framework
employs reinforcement learning to optimize weights that determine the
contribution of each module for a given dataset. A voting mechanism then
aggregates the module outputs to produce the final decision. RV-HATE offers two
primary advantages: (1)~it improves detection accuracy by tailoring the
detection process to dataset-specific attributes, and (2)~it also provides
interpretable insights into the distinctive features of each dataset.
Consequently, our approach effectively addresses implicit hate speech and
achieves superior performance compared to conventional static methods. Our code
is available at https://github.com/leeyejin1231/RV-HATE.

*Zhiwen Ruan,Yixia Li,He Zhu,Yun Chen,Peng Li,Yang Liu,Guanhua Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Critical Token Fine-tuning (CFT)方法，仅对通过反事实扰动识别出的关键推理令牌进行微调，在数学推理任务中优于标准SFT，同时保持输出多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准监督微调(SFT)对所有令牌进行统一惩罚，忽略了只有少数关键令牌决定推理正确性，导致输出多样性减少和泛化能力有限。

Method: CFT方法通过反事实扰动识别功能上不可或缺的关键令牌，仅对这些决定性推理步骤进行梯度更新，同时保留非关键令牌的多样性。

Result: 在5个模型、3个模型家族和11个数学推理基准上的实验表明，CFT仅微调不到12%的令牌，但始终优于标准SFT，并改善了采样多样性。

Conclusion: CFT是一个实用且通用的框架，可实现高效和鲁棒的LLM微调，为强化学习提供更强的初始化，并在后续训练阶段保持性能增益。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
as a key method to adapt pre-trained models to domain-specific tasks such as
mathematical reasoning. However, standard SFT uniformly penalizes all tokens,
neglecting that only a small subset of critical tokens determines reasoning
correctness. This uniform supervision often causes reduced output diversity and
limited generalization. We propose Critical Token Fine-tuning (CFT), a simple
yet effective approach that updates only tokens identified as functionally
indispensable via counterfactual perturbations. By focusing gradient signals on
these decisive reasoning steps while preserving the diversity of non-critical
tokens, CFT can enhance both generation and diversity. Extensive experiments on
five models across three families (Qwen, OLMo, LLaMA) and eleven mathematical
reasoning benchmarks show that CFT, despite fine-tuning on less than 12% of
tokens, consistently outperforms standard SFT. Moreover, CFT enables test-time
scaling through improved sampling diversity and provides a stronger
initialization for reinforcement learning, sustaining performance gains in
later training stages while maintaining higher entropy for better exploration.
These results highlight CFT as a practical and general framework for efficient
and robust LLM fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 提出了DEEPRESEARCHGUARD框架，通过四阶段安全保障机制解决深度研究框架中的安全漏洞，在提升防御成功率18.16%的同时降低过度拒绝率6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度研究框架缺乏充分的评估程序和阶段特定保护，通常只关注问答准确率而忽视报告质量的关键方面（可信度、连贯性、广度、深度和安全性），可能导致危险或恶意来源被整合到最终报告中。

Method: 引入DEEPRESEARCHGUARD框架，包含四阶段安全保障机制，支持参考文献和报告的开放域评估，并创建了DRSAFEBENCH阶段式深度研究安全基准。

Result: 在多种先进LLM（GPT-4o、Gemini-2.5-flash、DeepSeek-v3、o4-mini）上评估，平均防御成功率提升18.16%，过度拒绝率降低6%。输入防护提供最显著的早期保护，计划和研究防护增强引用规范和来源可信度。

Conclusion: DEEPRESEARCHGUARD能够实现全面的开放域评估和阶段感知防御，有效阻止有害内容传播，同时系统性地提高报告质量而不过度拒绝。

Abstract: Deep research frameworks have shown promising capabilities in synthesizing
comprehensive reports from web sources. While deep research possesses
significant potential to address complex issues through planning and research
cycles, existing frameworks are deficient in sufficient evaluation procedures
and stage-specific protections. They typically treat evaluation as exact match
accuracy of question-answering, but overlook crucial aspects of report quality
such as credibility, coherence, breadth, depth, and safety. This oversight may
result in hazardous or malicious sources being integrated into the final
report. To address these issues, we introduce DEEPRESEARCHGUARD, a
comprehensive framework featuring four-stage safeguards with open-domain
evaluation of references and reports. We assess performance across multiple
metrics, e.g., defense success rate and over-refusal rate, and five key report
dimensions. In the absence of a suitable safety benchmark, we introduce
DRSAFEBENCH, a stage-wise benchmark for deep research safety. Our evaluation
spans diverse state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-flash,
DeepSeek-v3, and o4-mini. DEEPRESEARCHGUARD achieves an average defense success
rate improvement of 18.16% while reducing over-refusal rate by 6%. The input
guard provides the most substantial early-stage protection by filtering out
obvious risks, while the plan and research guards enhance citation discipline
and source credibility. Through extensive experiments, we show that
DEEPRESEARCHGUARD enables comprehensive open-domain evaluation and stage-aware
defenses that effectively block harmful content propagation, while
systematically improving report quality without excessive over-refusal rates.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究对6个大型语言模型在2820个招聘场景中进行审计，发现模型对残障人士存在显著的ABLEIST伤害，这些伤害在性别和种姓边缘化的残障候选人中进一步加剧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注西方背景，忽视了全球南方地区残障人士面临的交叉边缘化问题（如性别和种姓），需要评估LLM在招聘等高风险领域对残障人士的歧视问题。

Method: 引入ABLEIST框架，包含5个针对能力主义的指标和3个交叉伤害指标，基于残疾研究文献，对6个LLM在2820个招聘场景中进行全面审计。

Result: 发现模型对残障候选人产生显著的ABLEIST伤害，许多最先进模型未能检测到这些伤害。性别和种姓边缘化的残障候选人面临更严重的交叉伤害（如象征主义）。

Conclusion: 当前安全工具存在关键盲点，需要在高风险领域（如招聘）对前沿模型进行交叉性安全评估。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly under scrutiny for perpetuating
identity-based discrimination in high-stakes domains such as hiring,
particularly against people with disabilities (PwD). However, existing research
remains largely Western-centric, overlooking how intersecting forms of
marginalization--such as gender and caste--shape experiences of PwD in the
Global South. We conduct a comprehensive audit of six LLMs across 2,820 hiring
scenarios spanning diverse disability, gender, nationality, and caste profiles.
To capture subtle intersectional harms and biases, we introduce ABLEIST
(Ableism, Inspiration, Superhumanization, and Tokenism), a set of five
ableism-specific and three intersectional harm metrics grounded in disability
studies literature. Our results reveal significant increases in ABLEIST harms
towards disabled candidates--harms that many state-of-the-art models failed to
detect. These harms were further amplified by sharp increases in intersectional
harms (e.g., Tokenism) for gender and caste-marginalized disabled candidates,
highlighting critical blind spots in current safety tools and the need for
intersectional safety evaluations of frontier models in high-stakes domains
like hiring.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DND是一种动态嵌套深度方法，通过选择关键token进行嵌套深度再处理来提升现成LLM的性能，在保持低参数和计算开销的同时显著提升模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高现成LLM的性能，同时避免对简单token进行冗余计算，专注于处理困难token。

Method: 在transformer层结束时，通过路由器识别关键token并反馈进行额外处理，采用路由器控制损失和阈值控制方案来确保选择的精确性和稳定性。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，将密集模型Qwen3-1.7B性能提升1.88%，MoE模型Qwen3-30B-A3B性能提升0.87%，参数和计算开销增加极小。

Conclusion: DND方法能有效提升预训练模型的性能，通过动态选择关键token进行再处理，实现了性能提升与计算效率的良好平衡。

Abstract: We introduce Dynamic Nested Depth (DND), a novel method that improves
performance for off-the-shelf LLMs by selecting critical tokens to reprocess in
a nested depth manner. Specifically, at the end of the given transformer layer,
DND identifies more critical tokens with a router and feeds them back for an
extra round of processing, effectively ``reviewing" difficult tokens while
avoiding redundant computation for easier ones. The dynamic selection mechanism
is tailored for precise control via two novel strategies: a router controlling
loss to enhance token selection distinguishability, and a threshold control
scheme to ensure selection stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DND
by directly integrating it into pre-trained dense and MoE models during a
post-training phase. On diverse benchmarks, this approach boosts the
performances of the dense Qwen3-1.7B by 1.88% and the MoE Qwen3-30B-A3B by
0.87%, all with a minimal parameter and computing increase.

Motivation: 现有的联合逻辑-数值推理数据集依赖固定规则集，任务复杂度控制有限，限制了它们在评估和训练中的泛化能力。

Method: 开发LogiNumSynth合成器，支持在自然语言中合成完全可控的联合推理任务，能够灵活控制推理难度级别。

Result: 实验显示多个LLM在逻辑-数值推理方面存在持续弱点，LogiNumSynth可作为诊断工具和针对性监督来源。

Conclusion: LogiNumSynth既能作为评估工具诊断模型弱点，又能通过合成数据增强LLM的推理性能，推动集成推理技能的发展。

Abstract: Joint logical-numerical reasoning remains a major challenge for language
models, yet existing datasets rely on fixed rule sets and offer limited control
over task complexity, constraining their generalizability for evaluation and
training. We present LogiNumSynth, a flexible natural language problem
synthesizer that synthesizes tasks requiring proficiency in joint logical
reasoning (e.g., rule-based reasoning) and numerical reasoning (e.g.,
arithmetic computation). LogiNumSynth supports fine-grained control over
reasoning world richness, logical reasoning depth, and the complexity of
numerical computations, enabling flexible data synthesis across difficulty
levels. We demonstrate three key contributions: (1) Synthesizer -- synthesizing
fully controllable joint reasoning tasks over natural language; (2) Evaluation
& Process Analysis -- evaluating both process accuracy and answer accuracy; (3)
Targeted Training -- using synthesized data to enhance LLMs' reasoning
performance. Experiments with multiple LLMs highlight persistent weaknesses in
logical-numerical reasoning, showing that LogiNumSynth can serve as both a
diagnostic tool and a source of targeted supervision for advancing integrated
reasoning skills.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在医疗领域提供临床指导，但直接部署给患者存在安全风险。需要重新定位LLM角色，使其作为临床助手与医生协作，而非直接面向患者。

Method: 通过两阶段启发-反馈调查识别临床工作流需求，构建包含92,000个问答实例的DoctorFLAN数据集，涵盖22个临床任务和27个专科。引入DoctorFLAN-test和DotaBench评估基准。

Result: 实验结果表明，DoctorFLAN显著提升了开源LLM在医疗环境中的性能，促进了与医生工作流程的对齐，并补充了现有的患者导向模型。

Conclusion: 这项工作为推进以医生为中心的医疗LLM开发提供了有价值的资源和框架。

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has transformed healthcare by
offering clinical guidance, yet their direct deployment to patients poses
safety risks due to limited domain expertise. To mitigate this, we propose
repositioning LLMs as clinical assistants that collaborate with experienced
physicians rather than interacting with patients directly. We conduct a
two-stage inspiration-feedback survey to identify real-world needs in clinical
workflows. Guided by this, we construct DoctorFLAN, a large-scale Chinese
medical dataset comprising 92,000 Q&A instances across 22 clinical tasks and 27
specialties. To evaluate model performance in doctor-facing applications, we
introduce DoctorFLAN-test (550 single-turn Q&A items) and DotaBench (74
multi-turn conversations). Experimental results with over ten popular LLMs
demonstrate that DoctorFLAN notably improves the performance of open-source
LLMs in medical contexts, facilitating their alignment with physician workflows
and complementing existing patient-oriented models. This work contributes a
valuable resource and framework for advancing doctor-centered medical LLM
development

TL;DR: LRD是一种两阶段并行解码框架，通过潜在精炼和预测反馈循环解决传统自回归模型的高延迟问题，在保持精度的同时实现最高10.6倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型存在严格顺序解码导致的高延迟问题，而现有扩散式方法存在信息丢失和过早决策的局限性。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：第一阶段将掩码位置保持为预测词元和掩码嵌入的分布混合，第二阶段逐步确定置信词元并保留不确定词元进行迭代反馈，使用KL散度动态作为收敛准则。

Result: 在编程任务（HumanEval +6.3，MBPP +2.6）和推理任务（GSM8K +2.9，MATH500 +3.8）上精度提升，同时实现最高10.6倍的加速。

Conclusion: LRD是并行序列生成的一个强大且通用的替代方案，在保持准确性的同时显著提升速度。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models remain the standard for natural language
generation but still suffer from high latency due to strictly sequential
decoding. Recent diffusion-inspired approaches, such as LlaDA and Dream,
mitigate this by generating in parallel, yet they suffer from two core
limitations: information loss, as predictive distributions for non-finalized
tokens are discarded at each step, and premature commitment, where local
decisions are made without sufficient global coordination. We introduce Latent
Refinement Decoding (LRD), a two-stage framework with Latent Refinement and a
Predictive Feedback Loop. The first stage maintains masked positions as
distributional mixtures of predicted tokens and the mask embedding, allowing
the model to establish more globally consistent beliefs. The second stage
progressively finalizes confident tokens while retaining uncertain ones for
iterative feedback. KL-divergence dynamics provide a principled and reliable
criterion for convergence and early stopping. Experiments across coding
(HumanEval +6.3, MBPP +2.6) and reasoning (GSM8K +2.9, MATH500 +3.8) show that
LRD improves accuracy while delivering speedups of up to 10.6x, making it a
strong and versatile alternative for parallel sequence generation.

TL;DR: 提出CGPO方法，利用置信度信号识别模型推理过程中的最大不确定性点，应用自生成的非人类推理路径指导来缓解轨迹漂移，在相同训练数据量下优于使用强模型或人工标注数据的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化LLM推理的方法存在训练偏差，过度依赖人类或高能力模型的中间步骤标注，限制了探索非人类推理路径的可能性，从而约束了可实现的性能。

Method: CGPO方法：通过置信度信号识别模型推理过程中的最低置信度点，在这些关键点应用自生成的非人类推理路径指导，避免轨迹漂移。

Result: 实验涵盖代码和数学推理任务，结果显示在相同训练数据量下，使用小模型生成数据的CGPO方法在大多数情况下比使用强模型或人工标注数据的方法表现更好。

Conclusion: CGPO方法通过置信度引导的推理路径优化，能够有效提升模型推理能力，减少对人工标注的依赖，并探索更多样化的推理路径。

Abstract: Current approaches for strengthening LLM reasoning tend to introduce a
training bias toward human-like reasoning trajectories. In step-wise preference
optimization, in particular, dependence on human or higher-capacity model
annotations for intermediate steps limits exploration of alternative,
non-human-like reasoning paths and thus constrains achievable performance.
Furthermore, through a small-scale pilot study, we observed that in
approximately 75% of cases, the model's first erroneous step occurs after the
lowest-confidence point. This suggests that guiding the model at its
lowest-confidence point before an error provides more accurate supervision than
locating the first explicit error. In this paper, we propose Confidence-Guided
Reasoning Path Preference Optimization (CGPO), a method that leverages a
confidence signal to identify points of maximal uncertainty in the model's
reasoning process and applies self-generated, non-human-like reasoning-path
guidance to mitigate trajectory drift. Our experiments span diverse models
applied to both code and mathematical reasoning tasks. The results show that,
with the same amount of training data, our method using data generated by a
small model can achieve better performance in most cases compared with
approaches using data generated by a strong model or human-annotated.

Motivation: LLM生成的代码经常包含细微但关键的安全漏洞，在安全敏感系统中部署存在重大风险。

Method: 使用Scala作为代表性强类型语言，结合Stainless框架进行形式化验证，构建类型导向的代理工作流程。

Result: 实验表明，直接的代码生成往往无法强制执行安全约束，而类型导向的代理流程能显著减轻输入验证和注入漏洞。

Conclusion: 结构化、类型引导的LLM工作流程有潜力提高自动化代码生成在高保证领域中的可信度。

Abstract: Large language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency in code
generation tasks across various programming languages. However, their outputs
often contain subtle but critical vulnerabilities, posing significant risks
when deployed in security-sensitive or mission-critical systems. This paper
introduces TypePilot, an agentic AI framework designed to enhance the security
and robustness of LLM-generated code by leveraging strongly typed and
verifiable languages, using Scala as a representative example. We evaluate the
effectiveness of our approach in two settings: formal verification with the
Stainless framework and general-purpose secure code generation. Our experiments
with leading open-source LLMs reveal that while direct code generation often
fails to enforce safety constraints, just as naive prompting for more secure
code, our type-focused agentic pipeline substantially mitigates input
validation and injection vulnerabilities. The results demonstrate the potential
of structured, type-guided LLM workflows to improve the SotA of the
trustworthiness of automated code generation in high-assurance domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于距离的文本分类方法具有快速推理和适应扩展标签集的优势，但多标签分类中阈值确定复杂，现有方法在不同模型、数据集和标签集上表现差异显著，需要更有效的阈值优化策略。

Method: 在多样化多标签文本分类数据集上进行探索性研究，验证文本与标签语义关系的变化，提出使用验证集优化标签特定阈值的新方法。

Result: 标签特定阈值方法相比归一化0.5阈值平均提升46%，比先前工作的统一阈值方法平均提升14%，即使在有限标注样本下也表现良好。

Conclusion: 基于距离的无监督文本分类中，标签特定阈值优化能显著提升性能，语义相似度分布在不同模型、数据集和标签集间存在显著差异，该方法具有实用性和适应性。

Abstract: Distance-based unsupervised text classification is a method within text
classification that leverages the semantic similarity between a label and a
text to determine label relevance. This method provides numerous benefits,
including fast inference and adaptability to expanding label sets, as opposed
to zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned neural networks that require re-training
in such cases. In multi-label distance-based classification and information
retrieval algorithms, thresholds are required to determine whether a text
instance is "similar" to a label or query. Similarity between a text and label
is determined in a dense embedding space, usually generated by state-of-the-art
sentence encoders. Multi-label classification complicates matters, as a text
instance can have multiple true labels, unlike in multi-class or binary
classification, where each instance is assigned only one label. We expand upon
previous literature on this underexplored topic by thoroughly examining and
evaluating the ability of sentence encoders to perform distance-based
classification. First, we perform an exploratory study to verify whether the
semantic relationships between texts and labels vary across models, datasets,
and label sets by conducting experiments on a diverse collection of realistic
multi-label text classification (MLTC) datasets. We find that similarity
distributions show statistically significant differences across models,
datasets and even label sets. We propose a novel method for optimizing
label-specific thresholds using a validation set. Our label-specific

*Paloma Piot,José Ramom Pichel Campos,Javier Parapar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究为欧洲西班牙语、葡萄牙语和加利西亚语构建了仇恨言论检测的多语言数据集，建立了新的基准，并评估了大语言模型在这些低资源语言上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仇恨言论在社交媒体上快速传播，但现有研究主要集中在英语，低资源语言缺乏足够的资源和基准。同时，这些语言通常有多个语言变体，这一因素在当前方法中常被忽视。

Method: 通过系统分析和整合现有资源，构建了欧洲西班牙语的仇恨言论数据集元集合，并翻译成欧洲葡萄牙语和两种加利西亚语变体，创建了对齐的多语言语料库。评估了大语言模型在零样本、少样本和微调设置下的性能。

Result: 为伊比利亚语言建立了仇恨言论检测的新基准，提供了基线结果，并进行了跨语言分析。

Conclusion: 研究强调了多语言和变体感知方法在仇恨言论检测中的重要性，为代表性不足的欧洲语言提供了改进基准的基础。

Abstract: Hate speech poses a serious threat to social cohesion and individual
well-being, particularly on social media, where it spreads rapidly. While
research on hate speech detection has progressed, it remains largely focused on
English, resulting in limited resources and benchmarks for low-resource
languages. Moreover, many of these languages have multiple linguistic
varieties, a factor often overlooked in current approaches. At the same time,
large language models require substantial amounts of data to perform reliably,
a requirement that low-resource languages often cannot meet. In this work, we
address these gaps by compiling a meta-collection of hate speech datasets for
European Spanish, standardised with unified labels and metadata. This
collection is based on a systematic analysis and integration of existing
resources, aiming to bridge the data gap and support more consistent and
scalable hate speech detection. We extended this collection by translating it
into European Portuguese and into a Galician standard that is more convergent
with Spanish and another Galician variant that is more convergent with
Portuguese, creating aligned multilingual corpora. Using these resources, we
establish new benchmarks for hate speech detection in Iberian languages. We
evaluate state-of-the-art large language models in zero-shot, few-shot, and
fine-tuning settings, providing baseline results for future research. Moreover,
we perform a cross-lingual analysis with our target languages. Our findings
underscore the importance of multilingual and variety-aware approaches in hate
speech detection and offer a foundation for improved benchmarking in
underrepresented European languages.

TL;DR: 提出了一个临床基础的评估框架，用于评估胸部X光视觉问答中思维链解释的忠实性，发现答案准确性与解释质量脱节，专有模型在归因和保真度方面表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型产生的思维链解释往往听起来合理但无法反映真实的决策过程，这在临床高风险应用中会削弱信任。现有评估很少捕捉到这种不一致性。

Method: 通过控制文本和图像修改，在三个维度上评估思维链的忠实性：临床保真度、因果归因和置信度校准。进行了读者研究（n=4），并对六个视觉语言模型进行了基准测试。

Result: 评估者与放射科医生的相关性在所有维度上都落在观察到的放射科医生间差异范围内。专有模型在归因（25.0% vs 1.4%）和保真度（36.1% vs 31.7%）方面表现优于开源模型。答案准确性与解释质量脱节。

Conclusion: 需要超越最终答案准确性进行评估，专有模型在解释忠实性方面表现更好，但部署风险依然存在，文本线索比视觉线索更能改变解释。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often produce chain-of-thought (CoT)
explanations that sound plausible yet fail to reflect the underlying decision
process, undermining trust in high-stakes clinical use. Existing evaluations
rarely catch this misalignment, prioritizing answer accuracy or adherence to
formats. We present a clinically grounded framework for chest X-ray visual
question answering (VQA) that probes CoT faithfulness via controlled text and
image modifications across three axes: clinical fidelity, causal attribution,
and confidence calibration. In a reader study (n=4), evaluator-radiologist
correlations fall within the observed inter-radiologist range for all axes,
with strong alignment for attribution (Kendall's $\tau_b=0.670$), moderate
alignment for fidelity ($\tau_b=0.387$), and weak alignment for confidence tone
($\tau_b=0.091$), which we report with caution. Benchmarking six VLMs shows
that answer accuracy and explanation quality are decoupled, acknowledging
injected cues does not ensure grounding, and text cues shift explanations more
than visual cues. While some open-source models match final answer accuracy,
proprietary models score higher on attribution (25.0% vs. 1.4%) and often on
fidelity (36.1% vs. 31.7%), highlighting deployment risks and the need to
evaluate beyond final answer accuracy.

TL;DR: 该论文通过引入CuDR任务和对比语料库，发现GPT-2模型中仅需约0.2%的稀疏计算图（discursive circuits）就能恢复话语理解能力，且这些电路能泛化到不同话语框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究transformer语言模型中哪些组件负责话语理解，特别是处理涉及长跨度和复杂推理的话语关系。

Method: 提出Completion under Discourse Relation (CuDR)任务，构建用于激活修补的最小对比对语料库，进行电路发现实验。

Result: 稀疏电路（约0.2%的GPT-2模型）在英语PDTB-based CuDR任务中恢复了话语理解能力，并能泛化到RST和SDRT等未见话语框架。

Conclusion: 下层网络捕获词汇语义和指代等语言特征，上层网络编码话语级抽象，特征效用在不同话语框架中保持一致。

Abstract: Which components in transformer language models are responsible for discourse
understanding? We hypothesize that sparse computational graphs, termed as
discursive circuits, control how models process discourse relations. Unlike
simpler tasks, discourse relations involve longer spans and complex reasoning.
To make circuit discovery feasible, we introduce a task called Completion under
Discourse Relation (CuDR), where a model completes a discourse given a
specified relation. To support this task, we construct a corpus of minimal
contrastive pairs tailored for activation patching in circuit discovery.
Experiments show that sparse circuits ($\approx 0.2\%$ of a full GPT-2 model)
recover discourse understanding in the English PDTB-based CuDR task. These
circuits generalize well to unseen discourse frameworks such as RST and SDRT.
Further analysis shows lower layers capture linguistic features such as lexical
semantics and coreference, while upper layers encode discourse-level
abstractions. Feature utility is consistent across frameworks (e.g.,
coreference supports Expansion-like relations).

TL;DR: RAGen是一个可扩展的模块化框架，用于生成领域特定的问题-答案-上下文三元组，以支持检索增强生成系统的领域适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成系统需要专门的、上下文丰富的训练数据来适应特定领域，而通用问答数据不足以满足这一需求。

Method: 通过识别文档中的关键概念，基于布鲁姆分类学原则生成多样化问题，并从相关上下文中提取精确答案来创建QAC三元组。支持多组件优化，包括语义分块、层次概念提取和多块检索。

Result: RAGen能够高效处理大规模和不断演化的文档语料库，无需冗余处理，特别适用于科学研究和企业知识库等动态领域。

Conclusion: RAGen提供了一个可扩展的解决方案，能够生成高质量的领域特定训练数据，有效支持RAG系统在不同领域的适应和优化。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the language understanding and
reasoning power of large language models (LLMs) with external retrieval to
enable domain-grounded responses. Effectively adapting RAG systems to
domain-specific settings requires specialized, context-rich training data
beyond general-purpose question-answering. Here, we propose RAGen, a scalable
and modular framework for generating domain-grounded question-answer-context
(QAC) triples tailored to diverse RAG adaptation approaches. RAGen produces
these QAC triples by identifying key concepts in documents, generating diverse
questions guided by Bloom's Taxonomy-inspired principles, and pairing them with
precise answers extracted from relevant contexts. RAGen supports multiple RAG
adaptation strategies, including the optimization of key components such as the
LLM, retriever, and embedding model, etc. Its modular pipeline features
semantic chunking, hierarchical concept extraction, and multi-chunk retrieval,
along with the introduction of curated distractor contexts to promote robust
reasoning. Designed for scalability, RAGen efficiently handles large and
evolving document corpora without redundant processing, making it especially
suitable for dynamic evolving domains such as scientific research and
enterprise knowledge bases.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLAQ框架揭示LLMs在简单和复杂查询中的事实回答存在系统性不一致，挑战了当前评估实践假设简单查询性能好意味着复杂任务可靠的观念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在事实问答基准上表现优异，但在简单查询和复杂查询之间存在可靠性差距，这削弱了模型的可信度，需要系统研究这种不一致性。

Method: 提出SLAQ评估框架，比较LLMs对同一事实问题在孤立短查询和复杂长查询中的回答，分析16个LLM在600个查询上的表现。

Result: 发现短长查询回答存在系统性不一致，存在位置依赖性准确率损失和动量效应，机制分析显示对齐事实激活重叠模型内部，机制相似性指标可预测对齐度达78%准确率。

Conclusion: 事实一致性是LLMs可信度的重要方面，当前评估实践需要重新考虑，不能假设简单事实查询性能好就意味着复杂知识寻求任务可靠。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can correctly answer "When was Einstein born?"
yet fail to provide the same date when writing about Einstein's life revealing
a fundamental inconsistency in how models access factual knowledge across task
complexities. While models display impressive accuracy on factual
question-answering benchmarks, the reliability gap between simple and complex
queries remains poorly understood, eroding their trustworthiness. In this work,
we introduce Short-Long Form Alignment for Factual Question Answering (SLAQ), a
controlled evaluation framework that compares LLMs' answers to the same factual
questions asked (a) in isolation (short) vs. (b) integrated into complex
queries (long). Looking at 16 LLMs across 600 queries, we find a systematic
misalignment of answers to the corresponding short and long queries. We further
uncover position-dependent accuracy loss and momentum effects where consecutive
correct or incorrect answers create self-reinforcing patterns. Through
mechanistic analysis, we find that aligned facts activate overlapping model
internals, and that metrics based on mechanistic similarity can predict
short-long answer alignment with up to 78% accuracy. Our work establishes
factual consistency over query complexity as an important aspect of LLMs'
trustworthiness and challenges current evaluation practices, which implicitly
assume that good performance for simple factual queries implies reliability in
more complex knowledge-seeking tasks too.

TL;DR: WebRouter是一个基于信息论的查询特定路由器，通过成本感知变分信息瓶颈目标，在压缩输入提示的同时惩罚预期操作成本，显著降低LLM大脑网络代理的操作成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM大脑网络代理在网页自动化中面临成本与性能的关键权衡，复杂的提示（包括目标、行动历史和状态）导致LLM集成性能下降。

Method: 提出WebRouter，采用成本感知变分信息瓶颈（ca-VIB）目标，学习输入提示的压缩表示，同时明确惩罚预期操作成本。

Result: 在WebVoyager基准的五个真实网站上的实验显示，WebRouter相比GPT-4o基线减少87.8%的操作成本，仅带来3.8%的准确率下降。

Conclusion: WebRouter通过信息论方法有效解决了网络代理的成本性能权衡问题，大幅降低操作成本同时保持高准确率。

Abstract: LLM-brained web agents offer powerful capabilities for web automation but
face a critical cost-performance trade-off. The challenge is amplified by web
agents' inherently complex prompts that include goals, action histories, and
environmental states, leading to degraded LLM ensemble performance. To address
this, we introduce WebRouter, a novel query-specific router trained from an
information-theoretic perspective. Our core contribution is a cost-aware
Variational Information Bottleneck (ca-VIB) objective, which learns a
compressed representation of the input prompt while explicitly penalizing the
expected operational cost. Experiments on five real-world websites from the
WebVoyager benchmark show that WebRouter reduces operational costs by a
striking 87.8\% compared to a GPT-4o baseline, while incurring only a 3.8\%
accuracy drop.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了NLP中道德情感分类的公平性问题，特别是在跨领域迁移场景下。通过引入道德公平一致性(MFC)指标，揭示了传统性能指标可能掩盖的公平性差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在跨领域迁移中，transformer模型的整体性能指标可能掩盖了公平性问题。作者旨在开发一个能够量化道德基础检测跨领域稳定性的指标，以更可靠地评估道德推理模型。

Method: 使用Moral Foundations Twitter Corpus和Moral Foundations Reddit Corpus，在BERT和DistilBERT模型上进行多标签分类实验，采用域内和跨域协议。引入Moral Fairness Consistency(MFC)指标来评估跨领域公平性。

Result: 发现跨领域迁移存在明显不对称性：Twitter→Reddit迁移使micro-F1下降14.9%，而Reddit→Twitter仅下降1.5%。权威标签表现出最大的公平性违规，MFC最低(0.78)，而忠诚标签MFC最高(0.96)。MFC与人口统计均等差异呈完美负相关。

Conclusion: MFC作为一个补充性的、诊断导向的指标，能够有效评估道德推理模型的公平性，为在不同语言环境中更可靠地部署模型提供了工具。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in natural language processing for moral sentiment
classification is challenging, particularly under cross-domain shifts where
transformer models are increasingly deployed. Using the Moral Foundations
Twitter Corpus (MFTC) and Moral Foundations Reddit Corpus (MFRC), this work
evaluates BERT and DistilBERT in a multi-label setting with in-domain and
cross-domain protocols. Aggregate performance can mask disparities: we observe
pronounced asymmetry in transfer, with Twitter->Reddit degrading micro-F1 by
14.9% versus only 1.5% for Reddit->Twitter. Per-label analysis reveals fairness
violations hidden by overall scores; notably, the authority label exhibits
Demographic Parity Differences of 0.22-0.23 and Equalized Odds Differences of
0.40-0.41. To address this gap, we introduce the Moral Fairness Consistency
(MFC) metric, which quantifies the cross-domain stability of moral foundation
detection. MFC shows strong empirical validity, achieving a perfect negative
correlation with Demographic Parity Difference (rho = -1.000, p < 0.001) while
remaining independent of standard performance metrics. Across labels, loyalty
demonstrates the highest consistency (MFC = 0.96) and authority the lowest (MFC
= 0.78). These findings establish MFC as a complementary, diagnosis-oriented
metric for fairness-aware evaluation of moral reasoning models, enabling more
reliable deployment across heterogeneous linguistic contexts. .

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文重新评估语义解析器的评估方法，将图匹配与自动定理证明相结合，发现基于图匹配的评估指标（如Smatch）不能准确反映逻辑等价性，并提出了逻辑敏感的评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图匹配评估指标（如Smatch）只关注表面重叠而非逻辑等价性，无法准确评估语义解析器的真实性能，特别是在推理导向的应用中。

Method: 比较了监督微调（T5-Small/Base）和少样本上下文学习（GPT-4o/4.1/5）两种解析器构建方法，使用图匹配、双向蕴含证明和一阶逻辑定理证明器进行综合评估。

Result: 研究发现，在图匹配上表现良好的模型往往无法产生逻辑等价的公式。归一化处理减少了目标变异性，提高了公式的良构性和逻辑充分性。性能下降主要出现在复杂公式、协调结构、介词短语和被动语态中。

Conclusion: 图匹配指标在推理导向应用中存在局限性，需要采用逻辑敏感的评估和训练目标，以及简化的归一化目标表示。

Abstract: Graph-matching metrics such as Smatch are the de facto standard for
evaluating neural semantic parsers, yet they capture surface overlap rather
than logical equivalence. We reassess evaluation by pairing graph-matching with
automated theorem proving. We compare two approaches to building parsers:
supervised fine-tuning (T5-Small/Base) and few-shot in-context learning
(GPT-4o/4.1/5), under normalized and unnormalized targets. We evaluate outputs
using graph-matching, bidirectional entailment between source and target
formulas with a first-order logic theorem prover, and well-formedness. Across
settings, we find that models performing well on graph-matching often fail to
produce logically equivalent formulas. Normalization reduces incidental target
variability, improves well-formedness, and strengthens logical adequacy. Error
analysis shows performance degrades with increasing formula complexity and with
coordination, prepositional phrases, and passive voice; the dominant failures
involve variable binding and indexing, and predicate naming. These findings
highlight limits of graph-based metrics for reasoning-oriented applications and
motivate logic-sensitive evaluation and training objectives together with
simplified, normalized target representations. All code and data for our
experiments are publicly available.

TL;DR: XQuant是一个无需训练、即插即用的KV缓存量化框架，通过数据无关校准和跨层压缩技术，实现亚1.4比特的超低比特宽度化，在保持模型精度的同时显著减少内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在处理长文本时KV缓存的内存需求急剧增长，给资源受限环境部署带来挑战，需要有效的量化方法来减少内存占用。

Method: 提出XQuant框架，包含计算量可忽略的数据无关校准方法和跨层KV缓存压缩技术，实现超低比特宽度化。

Result: 在TruthfulQA和LongBench上的实验表明，XQuant优于现有方法（如KIVI-2bit和AsymKV-1.5bit），在实现更低比特宽的同时保持更优性能。

Conclusion: XQuant在内存效率和模型精度之间建立了更好的平衡，为资源受限环境中的大语言模型部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse natural language processing tasks. However, their extensive memory
requirements, particularly due to KV cache growth during long-text
understanding and generation, present significant challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Quantization has emerged as a promising
solution to reduce memory consumption while preserving historical information.
We propose XQuant, a training-free and plug-and-play framework that achieves
ultra-low equivalent bit-width KV cache quantization. XQuant introduces two key
innovations: a computationally negligible data-free calibration method and
cross-layer KV cache compression, enabling quantization to sub-1.4 bits.
Extensive experiments on TruthfulQA and LongBench demonstrate that XQuant
outperforms state-of-the-art methods (e.g., KIVI-2bit and AsymKV-1.5bit) by
achieving lower bit-width while maintaining superior performance, establishing
a better trade-off between memory efficiency and model accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的AI代理攻击方式——内容攻击，即通过提供有偏见、误导性或虚假信息来操纵AI代理行为，而非传统的指令注入攻击。作者建议将自动事实核查任务重新用作AI代理的认知自卫工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御主要关注检测隐藏指令，但对基于内容操纵的攻击无效。AI代理需要能够批判性评估检索信息，以保护自身和用户免受内容攻击。

Method: 将自动事实核查任务重新用作AI代理的认知自卫工具，通过外部证据验证声明和评估来源可信度来防御内容攻击。

Result: 提出内容攻击概念，区别于传统的指令注入攻击，并论证现有防御措施对此类攻击无效。

Conclusion: AI代理需要采用自动事实核查作为认知自卫机制，通过批判性评估检索信息来防御内容攻击，这是保护AI系统安全的重要方向。

Abstract: When AI agents retrieve and reason over external documents, adversaries can
manipulate the data they receive to subvert their behaviour. Previous research
has studied indirect prompt injection, where the attacker injects malicious
instructions. We argue that injection of instructions is not necessary to
manipulate agents - attackers could instead supply biased, misleading, or false
information. We term this an attack by content. Existing defenses, which focus
on detecting hidden commands, are ineffective against attacks by content. To
defend themselves and their users, agents must critically evaluate retrieved
information, corroborating claims with external evidence and evaluating source
trustworthiness. We argue that this is analogous to an existing NLP task,
automated fact-checking, which we propose to repurpose as a cognitive
self-defense tool for agents.

TL;DR: 评估人类心理测量测试在大语言模型中的可靠性和有效性，发现测试分数与模型在下游任务中的行为不一致，表明直接应用人类心理测量测试到LLMs存在问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理测量测试越来越多地用于评估大语言模型的心理结构，但尚不清楚这些为人类设计的测试在应用于LLMs时是否能产生有意义的结果。

Method: 系统评估三种心理结构（性别歧视、种族歧视和道德）的人类心理测量测试的可靠性和有效性，通过收敛效度（理论基础的测试间相关性）和生态效度（测试分数与下游任务行为的对齐度）进行评估。

Result: 发现跨多个项目和提示变体的中等可靠性，但心理测量测试分数与模型在下游任务中的行为不一致，有时甚至呈负相关，表明生态效度低。

Conclusion: 在解释心理测量测试分数之前进行系统评估至关重要，为人类设计的心理测量测试不能直接应用于LLMs而需要适应。

Abstract: Psychometric tests are increasingly used to assess psychological constructs
in large language models (LLMs). However, it remains unclear whether these
tests -- originally developed for humans -- yield meaningful results when
applied to LLMs. In this study, we systematically evaluate the reliability and
validity of human psychometric tests for three constructs: sexism, racism, and
morality. We find moderate reliability across multiple item and prompt
variations. Validity is evaluated through both convergent (i.e., testing
theory-based inter-test correlations) and ecological approaches (i.e., testing
the alignment between tests scores and behavior in real-world downstream
tasks). Crucially, we find that psychometric test scores do not align, and in
some cases even negatively correlate with, model behavior in downstream tasks,
indicating low ecological validity. Our results highlight that systematic
evaluations of psychometric tests is essential before interpreting their
scores. They also suggest that psychometric tests designed for humans cannot be
applied directly to LLMs without adaptation.

Motivation: 解决实时假新闻检测中证据稀缺的问题，现有方法过度依赖外部证据，在证据不足时泛化能力差。

Method: 采用顺序评估机制，包含三个独立视角：基于证据的评估、基于推理的评估和基于情感的回退机制，通过指令调优和伪标签增强评估准确性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，显著提升了对实时新闻的泛化能力，并发布了RealTimeNews-25新基准数据集。

Conclusion: EASE框架通过评估感知的决策机制有效解决了证据稀缺下的假新闻检测问题，为实时检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Fake news detection becomes particularly challenging in real-time scenarios,
where emerging events often lack sufficient supporting evidence. Existing
approaches often rely heavily on external evidence and therefore struggle to
generalize under evidence scarcity. To address this issue, we propose
Evaluation-Aware Selection of Experts (EASE), a novel framework for real-time
fake news detection that dynamically adapts its decision-making process
according to the assessed sufficiency of available evidence. EASE introduces a
sequential evaluation mechanism comprising three independent perspectives: (1)
Evidence-based evaluation, which assesses evidence and incorporates it into
decision-making only when the evidence is sufficiently supportive; (2)
Reasoning-based evaluation, which leverages the world knowledge of large
language models (LLMs) and applies them only when their reliability is
adequately established; and (3) Sentiment-based fallback, which integrates
sentiment cues when neither evidence nor reasoning is reliable. To enhance the
accuracy of evaluation processes, EASE employs instruction tuning with pseudo
labels to guide each evaluator in justifying its perspective-specific knowledge
through interpretable reasoning. Furthermore, the expert modules integrate the
evaluators' justified assessments with the news content to enable
evaluation-aware decision-making, thereby enhancing overall detection accuracy.
Moreover, we introduce RealTimeNews-25, a new benchmark comprising recent news
for evaluating model generalization on emerging news with limited evidence.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that EASE not only achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmarks, but also significantly improves
generalization to real-time news. The code and dataset are available:

TL;DR: 研究发现情境学习(ICL)也会引发涌现性错位(EM)，即使不进行微调，仅通过少量情境示例就能导致大型语言模型产生广泛错位的响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究表明窄域微调会导致模型广泛错位，但这种现象是否也存在于情境学习中尚不清楚。

Method: 使用三个前沿模型在三个数据集上进行实验，通过提供64-256个窄域情境示例，并分析逐步推理过程来研究EM机制。

Result: 在64个情境示例下，模型产生错位响应的比例为2%-17%，在256个示例下可达58%。67.5%的错位推理轨迹显示模型通过采用鲁莽或危险的"人格"来合理化有害输出。

Conclusion: 情境学习同样会引发涌现性错位，其机制与微调诱导的EM类似，模型会通过角色扮演来合理化有害行为。

LLMs, a phenomenon termed emergent misalignment (EM). While concerning, these
findings were limited to finetuning and activation steering, leaving out
in-context learning (ICL). We therefore ask: does EM emerge in ICL? We find
that it does: across three datasets, three frontier models produce broadly
misaligned responses at rates between 2% and 17% given 64 narrow in-context
examples, and up to 58% with 256 examples. We also examine mechanisms of EM by
eliciting step-by-step reasoning (while leaving in-context examples unchanged).
Manual analysis of the resulting chain-of-thought shows that 67.5% of
misaligned traces explicitly rationalize harmful outputs by adopting a reckless
or dangerous ''persona'', echoing prior results on finetuning-induced EM.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are vital for knowledge-intensive tasks and have shown
promise in reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However,
constructing high-quality KGs remains difficult, requiring accurate information
extraction and structured representations that support interpretability and
downstream utility. Existing LLM-based approaches often focus narrowly on
entity and relation extraction, limiting coverage to sentence-level contexts or
relying on predefined schemas. We propose a hierarchical extraction framework
that organizes information at multiple levels, enabling the creation of
semantically rich and well-structured KGs. Using state-of-the-art LLMs, we
extract and construct knowledge graphs and evaluate them comprehensively from
both structural and semantic perspectives. Our results highlight the strengths
and shortcomings of current LLMs in KG construction and identify key challenges
for future work. To advance research in this area, we also release a curated
dataset of LLM-generated KGs derived from research papers on children's mental
well-being. This resource aims to foster more transparent, reliable, and
impactful applications in high-stakes domains such as healthcare.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合模仿学习和语言反馈的方法，使智能体能够从最优和次优演示中学习，通过语言反馈来区分不同行为模式，从而在保持数据效率的同时提高组合泛化能力和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于模仿学习的方法只能从最优演示中学习，无法处理次优行为，而强化学习虽然能处理次优数据但数据效率低。本文旨在探索如何利用语言反馈使智能体能够从各种质量的演示中学习。

Method: 将语言反馈嵌入作为Transformer策略的输入序列，并可选地结合反馈预测的辅助自监督学习目标来补充传统的下一动作预测目标。

Result: 在BabyAI-XGen环境中的实验表明，该方法显著提高了智能体的组合泛化能力和鲁棒性，能够成功将次优行为转化为学习机会。

Conclusion: 语言反馈是语言指定具身任务中中间标量奖励的有竞争力且直观的替代方案，能够在保持数据效率的同时实现稳健学习。

Abstract: Current approaches to embodied AI tend to learn policies from expert
demonstrations. However, without a mechanism to evaluate the quality of
demonstrated actions, they are limited to learning from optimal behaviour, or
they risk replicating errors and inefficiencies. While reinforcement learning
offers one alternative, the associated exploration typically results in
sacrificing data efficiency. This work explores how agents trained with
imitation learning can learn robust representations from both optimal and
suboptimal demonstrations when given access to constructive language feedback
as a means to contextualise different modes of behaviour. We directly provide
language feedback embeddings as part of the input sequence into a
Transformer-based policy, and optionally complement the traditional next action
prediction objective with auxiliary self-supervised learning objectives for
feedback prediction. We test our approach on a range of embodied
Vision-and-Language tasks in our custom BabyAI-XGen environment and show
significant improvements in agents' compositional generalisation abilities and
robustness, suggesting that our data-efficient method allows models to
successfully convert suboptimal behaviour into learning opportunities. Overall,
our results suggest that language feedback is a competitive and intuitive
alternative to intermediate scalar rewards for language-specified embodied
tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一个结构化视觉语言模型提示框架，用于从简化文本生成可访问图像，通过五种提示模板和可访问性约束来改善智力障碍人士的文本理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智力障碍人士在理解复杂文本方面存在困难，现有文本到图像模型往往优先考虑美观性而非可访问性，需要研究视觉插图与文本简化的关系。

Method: 设计了五种提示模板（基础对象聚焦、情境场景、教育布局、多级细节、网格布局），使用400个句子级简化文本进行两阶段评估：第一阶段用CLIP分数评估提示模板效果，第二阶段由四位可访问性专家对生成图像进行人工标注。

Result: 基础对象聚焦提示模板实现了最高的语义对齐，表明视觉极简主义增强了语言可访问性；复古风格被专家评为最可访问，维基百科是最有效的数据源；文本简单性维度显示出强可靠性，而图像质量更具主观性。

Conclusion: 该框架为可访问内容生成提供了实用指南，并强调了结构化提示在AI生成视觉可访问性工具中的重要性。

Abstract: Individuals with intellectual disabilities often have difficulties in
comprehending complex texts. While many text-to-image models prioritize
aesthetics over accessibility, it is not clear how visual illustrations relate
to text simplifications (TS) generated from them. This paper presents a
structured vision-language model (VLM) prompting framework for generating
accessible images from simplified texts. We designed five prompt templates,
i.e., Basic Object Focus, Contextual Scene, Educational Layout, Multi-Level
Detail, and Grid Layout, each following distinct spatial arrangements while
adhering to accessibility constraints such as object count limits, spatial
separation, and content restrictions. Using 400 sentence-level simplifications
from four established TS datasets (OneStopEnglish, SimPA, Wikipedia, and
ASSET), we conducted a two-phase evaluation: Phase 1 assessed prompt template
effectiveness with CLIPScores, and Phase 2 involved human annotation of
generated images across ten visual styles by four accessibility experts.
Results show that the Basic Object Focus prompt template achieved the highest
semantic alignment, indicating that visual minimalism enhances language
accessibility. Expert evaluation further identified Retro style as the most
accessible and Wikipedia as the most effective data source. Inter-annotator
agreement varied across dimensions, with Text Simplicity showing strong
reliability and Image Quality proving more subjective. Overall, our framework
offers practical guidelines for accessible content generation and underscores
the importance of structured prompting in AI-generated visual accessibility
tools.

TL;DR: 该研究揭示了LLMs中存在的上下文无关情感机制，识别了情感计算的具体神经元和注意力头，构建了全局情感电路，并通过直接调控这些电路实现了99.65%的情感表达准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对LLMs情感智能需求的增长，需要理解情感表达的内部机制并控制生成文本中的情感。研究旨在回答三个核心问题：LLMs是否包含上下文无关的情感机制、这些机制的具体形式、以及能否用于通用情感控制。

Method: 构建受控数据集SEV，提取上下文无关情感方向，通过分析分解和因果分析识别情感计算的神经元和注意力头，通过消融和增强干预验证其因果作用，量化各子层对最终情感表征的因果影响，整合局部组件构建全局情感电路。

Result: 发现了跨上下文一致的情感编码，识别了局部情感计算组件并验证其因果作用，构建了驱动情感表达的全局情感电路，通过直接调控这些电路实现了99.65%的情感表达准确率，超越了基于提示和引导的方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统揭示和验证LLMs中情感电路的研究，为可解释性和可控情感智能提供了新见解，证明了通过调控内部情感电路可以实现精确的情感控制。

Abstract: As the demand for emotional intelligence in large language models (LLMs)
grows, a key challenge lies in understanding the internal mechanisms that give
rise to emotional expression and in controlling emotions in generated text.
This study addresses three core questions: (1) Do LLMs contain context-agnostic
mechanisms shaping emotional expression? (2) What form do these mechanisms
take? (3) Can they be harnessed for universal emotion control? We first
construct a controlled dataset, SEV (Scenario-Event with Valence), to elicit
comparable internal states across emotions. Subsequently, we extract
context-agnostic emotion directions that reveal consistent, cross-context
encoding of emotion (Q1). We identify neurons and attention heads that locally
implement emotional computation through analytical decomposition and causal
analysis, and validate their causal roles via ablation and enhancement
interventions. Next, we quantify each sublayer's causal influence on the
model's final emotion representation and integrate the identified local
components into coherent global emotion circuits that drive emotional
expression (Q2). Directly modulating these circuits achieves 99.65%
emotion-expression accuracy on the test set, surpassing prompting- and
steering-based methods (Q3). To our knowledge, this is the first systematic
study to uncover and validate emotion circuits in LLMs, offering new insights
into interpretability and controllable emotional intelligence.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了LLM特定效用的概念，发现不同LLM对相同段落的效用不同，人类标注的段落对特定LLM并非最优，且效用段落在不同LLM间不可迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索增强生成(RAG)研究将效用视为通用属性，忽略了不同LLM由于内部知识和理解能力差异，可能从相同段落中获得不同收益的问题。

Method: 通过跨多个数据集和LLM的大规模实验，研究LLM特定效用；提出基于困惑度的LLM特定效用评估基准程序；评估现有效用判断方法。

Result: 人类标注的段落对特定LLM并非最优；真实效用段落在不同LLM间不可迁移；基于伪答案的言语化方法表现稳健，但LLM在效用评估方面存在困难。

Conclusion: RAG研究必须采用LLM特定效用概念，因为不同LLM对相同段落的效用存在显著差异，且人类标注不能准确反映LLM的实际需求。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
incorporating external knowledge. While traditional retrieval focuses on
relevance, RAG's effectiveness depends on the utility of retrieved passages,
i.e., the usefulness in facilitating the generation of an accurate and
comprehensive answer. Existing studies often treat utility as a generic
attribute, ignoring the fact that different LLMs may benefit differently from
the same passage due to variations in internal knowledge and comprehension
ability. In this work, we introduce and systematically investigate the notion
of LLM-specific utility. Through large-scale experiments across multiple
datasets and LLMs, we demonstrate that human-annotated passages are not optimal
for LLMs and that ground-truth utilitarian passages are not transferable across
different LLMs. These findings highlight the necessity of adopting the
LLM-specific utility in RAG research. Our findings indicate that some
human-annotated passages are not ground-truth utilitarian passages for specific
LLMs, partially due to the varying readability of queries and passages for
LLMs, a tendency for which perplexity is a key metric. Based on these findings,
we propose a benchmarking procedure for LLM-specific utility judgments. We
evaluate existing utility judgment methods on six datasets and find that while
verbalized methods using pseudo-answers perform robustly, LLMs struggle to
assess utility effectively-failing to reject all passages for known queries and
to select truly useful ones for unknown queries.

TL;DR: 提出了Rollout Routing Replay (R3)方法来解决MoE模型在强化学习训练中的路由不稳定性问题，通过记录推理阶段的路由分布并在训练时重放，显著减少了训练-推理策略差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型的路由机制在强化学习训练中会引入不稳定性，甚至导致训练崩溃。研究发现训练和推理阶段的路由行为存在显著差异，即使在相同条件下，路由框架也会产生不同的专家选择。

Method: 提出R3方法：记录推理引擎的路由分布，并在训练阶段重放这些分布。这显著降低了训练-推理策略的KL散度，缓解了极端差异，同时不影响训练速度。

Result: 在各种设置下的广泛实验证实，R3成功稳定了RL训练，防止了崩溃，并且在性能上优于GSPO和TIS等方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为稳定MoE模型中的强化学习训练提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a crucial approach for enhancing
the capabilities of large language models. However, in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
models, the routing mechanism often introduces instability, even leading to
catastrophic RL training collapse. We analyze the training-inference
consistency of MoE models and identify a notable discrepancy in routing
behaviors between the two phases. Moreover, even under identical conditions,
the routing framework can yield divergent expert selections across repeated
forward passes. To address this foundational inconsistency, we propose Rollout
Routing Replay (R3), a method that records routing distributions from the
inference engine and replays them during training. R3 significantly reduces
training-inference policy KL divergence and mitigates extreme discrepancies
without compromising training speed. Extensive experiments on various settings
confirm that R3 succeeds in stabilizing RL training, preventing collapse and
outperforming methods such as GSPO and TIS. We believe this work can offer a
new solution for stabilizing RL in MoE models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在微调过程中会记忆训练数据，从而暴露私有或受版权保护的文本。现有防御方法主要针对预训练阶段，而对微调过程中的记忆问题理解不足。

Method: 在Pythia、Llama3和Mistral模型上进行微调实验，跟踪逐字记忆情况。提出基于n-gram的记忆评分作为早期停止准则，并引入n-gram感知的损失正则化器。

Result: 记忆现象在训练早期急剧增加，通常远在验证困惑度或评估性能优化之前。提出的方法可将记忆减少高达40%，同时最小化性能损失。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语言模型微调过程中的记忆动态，提供了实用且可扩展的见解来缓解记忆问题。

Abstract: Although large language models excel across many tasks, they can memorise
training data and thereby expose private or copyrighted text. Most defences
target the pre-training stage, leaving memorisation during fine-tuning,
especially for domain adaptation and instruction tuning, poorly understood. We
fine-tune Pythia, Llama3, and Mistral models spanning 1.4B-70B parameters on
common evaluation datasets and track verbatim memorisation throughout training.
We find that memorisation increases dramatically in the first few epochs, often
significantly before either validation perplexity or evaluation performance is
optimised. We use a simple but effective n-gram memorisation score which
reliably precedes verbatim memorisation; using it as an early-stopping
criterion mitigates memorisation with minimal performance loss. Further, we
introduce an n-gram-aware loss regulariser and show that it reduces
memorisation across all model families tested by up to 40% while minimising
evaluation performance trade-offs when compared to an existing memorisation
mitigation strategy. These results yield practical, scalable insights into
memorisation dynamics during language model fine-tuning.

Method: 构建包含100+小时视频、32.4M话语标记的多模态狼人杀数据集，提出两阶段策略对齐评估：话语评估（多选任务）和决策评估（投票选择和角色推断）。

Result: 实验显示最先进的LLM表现各异，约半数模型得分低于0.50，在欺骗和反事实推理方面存在明显差距。

Conclusion: 该数据集和评估框架为多智能体交互中的语言、推理和策略研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Social deduction games like Werewolf combine language, reasoning, and
strategy, providing a testbed for studying natural language and social
intelligence. However, most studies reduce the game to LLM-based self-play,
yielding templated utterances and anecdotal cases that overlook the richness of
social gameplay. Evaluation further relies on coarse metrics such as survival
time or subjective scoring due to the lack of quality reference data. To
address these gaps, we curate a high-quality, human-verified multimodal
Werewolf dataset containing over 100 hours of video, 32.4M utterance tokens,
and 15 rule variants. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel
strategy-alignment evaluation that leverages the winning faction's strategies
as ground truth in two stages: 1) Speech evaluation, formulated as
multiple-choice-style tasks that assess whether the model can adopt appropriate
stances across five dimensions of social ability; and 2) Decision evaluation,
which assesses the model's voting choices and opponent-role inferences. This
framework enables a fine-grained evaluation of models' linguistic and reasoning
capabilities, while capturing their ability to generate strategically coherent
gameplay. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art LLMs show diverse
performance, with roughly half remain below 0.50, revealing clear gaps in
deception and counterfactual reasoning. We hope our dataset further inspires
research on language, reasoning, and strategy in multi-agent interaction.

Result: 在LLaMA-3.1-8B和Qwen-2.5-7B上的实验显示，KnowRL持续改善了自我认知，仅需少量种子集且无需外部监督，在几次迭代中就能实现高达28%的准确率和12%的F1分数提升，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架解锁了LLM自我提升知识认知的潜力，为实现更可靠、更负责任的人工智能以及在关键应用中更安全的部署打开了大门。由于其简单性和不依赖外部努力，建议将此可靠性增强过程应用于所有未来模型。

Abstract: Truly reliable AI requires more than simply scaling up knowledge; it demands
the ability to know what it knows and when it does not. Yet recent research
shows that even the best LLMs misjudge their own competence in more than one in
five cases, making any response born of such internal uncertainty impossible to
fully trust. Inspired by self-improvement reinforcement learning techniques
that require minimal data, we present a simple but powerful framework KnowRL
that strengthens a model's internal understanding of its own feasibility
boundaries, enabling safer and more responsible behaviour. Our framework
combines two components: (i) introspection, where the model generates and
classifies tasks it judges feasible or infeasible, and (ii) consensus-based
rewarding, where stability of self-knowledge assessment is reinforced through
internal agreement. By using internally generated data, this design strengthens
consistency in self-knowledge and entirely avoids costly external supervision.
In experiments on LLaMA-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B, KnowRL steadily improved
self-knowledge, validated by both intrinsic self-consistency and extrinsic
benchmarking. With nothing more than a small seed set and no external
supervision, our method drove gains as high as 28% in accuracy and 12% in F1,
outperforming baselines in just a few iterations. Our framework essentially
unlocks the untapped capacity of LLMs to self-improve their knowledge
awareness, opening the door to reliable, more accountable AI and safer
deployment in critical applications. Owing to its simplicity and independence
from external effort, we encourage applying this reliability-enhancing process
to all future models.

Method: 使用两个关于营养、政治和经济的面板调查，研究LLM合成调查响应的方法与纠偏方法的相互作用，并探索人类响应在两者之间的最佳分配方式。

Result: 合成方法单独使用会产生24-86%的显著偏差，而结合纠偏方法可将偏差降至5%以下，并将有效样本量提升高达14%。

Conclusion: 挑战了将所有人类响应用于微调的常见做法，证明在固定预算下，将大部分人类响应分配给纠偏方法能实现更有效的估计。

Abstract: Surveys provide valuable insights into public opinion and behavior, but their
execution is costly and slow. Large language models (LLMs) have been proposed
as a scalable, low-cost substitute for human respondents, but their outputs are
often biased and yield invalid estimates. We study the interplay between
synthesis methods that use LLMs to generate survey responses and rectification
methods that debias population estimates, and explore how human responses are
best allocated between them. Using two panel surveys with questions on
nutrition, politics, and economics, we find that synthesis alone introduces
substantial bias (24-86%), whereas combining it with rectification reduces bias
below 5% and increases effective sample size by up to 14%. Overall, we
challenge the common practice of using all human responses for fine-tuning,
showing that under a fixed budget, allocating most to rectification results in
far more effective estimation.

Abstract: Generative large language models (LLMs) have become central to everyday life,
producing human-like text across diverse domains. A growing body of research
investigates whether these models also exhibit personality- and
demographic-like characteristics in their language. In this work, we introduce
a novel, data-driven methodology for assessing LLM personality without relying
on self-report questionnaires, applying instead automatic personality and
gender classifiers to model replies on open-ended questions collected from
Reddit. Comparing six widely used models to human-authored responses, we find
that LLMs systematically express higher Agreeableness and lower Neuroticism,
reflecting cooperative and stable conversational tendencies. Gendered language
patterns in model text broadly resemble those of human writers, though with
reduced variation, echoing prior findings on automated agents. We contribute a
new dataset of human and model responses, along with large-scale comparative
analyses, shedding new light on the topic of personality and demographic
patterns of generative AI.

Motivation: 传统NER方法面临实体类别持续增加的现实挑战，现有持续学习方法存在灾难性遗忘和非实体类型语义偏移问题。

Method: 将CNER任务转换为持续实体三元组序列生成问题，使用预训练seq2seq模型，结合类型特定置信度伪标签策略和知识蒸馏来保留学习知识。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在多个CNER设置中优于先前最先进方法，与非持续学习结果的差距最小。

Conclusion: GenCNER是一个简单有效的生成式框架，能够有效解决持续命名实体识别中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Traditional named entity recognition (NER) aims to identify text mentions
into pre-defined entity types. Continual Named Entity Recognition (CNER) is
introduced since entity categories are continuously increasing in various
real-world scenarios. However, existing continual learning (CL) methods for NER
face challenges of catastrophic forgetting and semantic shift of non-entity
type. In this paper, we propose GenCNER, a simple but effective Generative
framework for CNER to mitigate the above drawbacks. Specifically, we skillfully
convert the CNER task into sustained entity triplet sequence generation problem
and utilize a powerful pre-trained seq2seq model to solve it. Additionally, we
design a type-specific confidence-based pseudo labeling strategy along with
knowledge distillation (KD) to preserve learned knowledge and alleviate the
impact of label noise at the triplet level. Experimental results on two
benchmark datasets show that our framework outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods in multiple CNER settings, and achieves the smallest
gap compared with non-CL results.

Conclusion: 大语言模型能够有效执行文本预处理任务，在考虑上下文的同时实现与传统方法相当甚至更好的性能，为文本预处理提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: Text preprocessing is a fundamental component of Natural Language Processing,
involving techniques such as stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization to
prepare text as input for further processing and analysis. Despite the
context-dependent nature of the above techniques, traditional methods usually
ignore contextual information. In this paper, we investigate the idea of using
Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform various preprocessing tasks, due to
their ability to take context into account without requiring extensive
language-specific annotated resources. Through a comprehensive evaluation on
web-sourced data, we compare LLM-based preprocessing (specifically stopword
removal, lemmatization and stemming) to traditional algorithms across multiple
text classification tasks in six European languages. Our analysis indicates
that LLMs are capable of replicating traditional stopword removal,
lemmatization, and stemming methods with accuracies reaching 97%, 82%, and 74%,
respectively. Additionally, we show that ML algorithms trained on texts
preprocessed by LLMs achieve an improvement of up to 6% with respect to the
$F_1$ measure compared to traditional techniques. Our code, prompts, and
results are publicly available at

### [360] [Hallucination Detection via Internal States and Structured Reasoning Consistency in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11529)
*Yusheng Song,Lirong Qiu,Xi Zhang,Zhihao Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一框架来解决LLM幻觉检测中的"检测困境"，通过多路径推理机制和段感知时序交叉注意力模块，有效融合内部状态探测和思维链验证两种方法的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM幻觉检测方法存在"检测困境"：内部状态探测擅长检测事实不一致但无法识别逻辑谬误，而思维链验证则相反。这种分裂导致任务依赖的盲点，需要统一框架来弥合这一关键差距。

Method: 引入多路径推理机制获取更可比较的细粒度信号，以及段感知时序交叉注意力模块来自适应融合这些对齐后的表征，从而精确定位细微的不一致。

Result: 在三个不同基准测试和两个领先LLM上的广泛实验表明，该框架始终显著优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 该工作成功解决了LLM幻觉检测中的检测困境，提供了一个统一的检测框架，能够同时处理事实密集型和逻辑密集型任务中的幻觉问题。

Abstract: The detection of sophisticated hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs)
is hampered by a ``Detection Dilemma'': methods probing internal states
(Internal State Probing) excel at identifying factual inconsistencies but fail
on logical fallacies, while those verifying externalized reasoning
(Chain-of-Thought Verification) show the opposite behavior. This schism creates
a task-dependent blind spot: Chain-of-Thought Verification fails on
fact-intensive tasks like open-domain QA where reasoning is ungrounded, while
Internal State Probing is ineffective on logic-intensive tasks like
mathematical reasoning where models are confidently wrong. We resolve this with
a unified framework that bridges this critical gap. However, unification is
hindered by two fundamental challenges: the Signal Scarcity Barrier, as coarse
symbolic reasoning chains lack signals directly comparable to fine-grained
internal states, and the Representational Alignment Barrier, a deep-seated
mismatch between their underlying semantic spaces. To overcome these, we
introduce a multi-path reasoning mechanism to obtain more comparable,
fine-grained signals, and a segment-aware temporalized cross-attention module
to adaptively fuse these now-aligned representations, pinpointing subtle
dissonances. Extensive experiments on three diverse benchmarks and two leading
LLMs demonstrate that our framework consistently and significantly outperforms
strong baselines. Our code is available: https://github.com/peach918/HalluDet.

### [361] [An Encoder-Integrated PhoBERT with Graph Attention for Vietnamese Token-Level Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11537)
*Ba-Quang Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TextGraphFuseGAT是一个结合预训练transformer编码器(PhoBERT)和图注意力网络的神经架构，用于越南语标记级分类任务，在多个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有序列标注模型主要依赖顺序上下文，难以充分捕捉标记间的复杂依赖关系，需要结合图结构来增强标记间的关系建模能力。

Method: 构建基于PhoBERT标记嵌入的完全连接图，使用图注意力网络捕捉标记间依赖，再通过Transformer自注意力层增强上下文表示，最后通过分类头进行序列标注。

Result: 在三个越南语基准数据集(PhoNER-COVID19、PhoDisfluency、VietMed-NER)上的实验表明，该方法持续优于transformer-only和混合神经网络基线模型。

Conclusion: 结合预训练语义特征和图关系建模能有效提升跨多个领域的标记分类性能，VietMed-NER作为首个越南语医疗口语NER数据集具有重要价值。

Abstract: We propose a novel neural architecture named TextGraphFuseGAT, which
integrates a pretrained transformer encoder (PhoBERT) with Graph Attention
Networks for token-level classification tasks. The proposed model constructs a
fully connected graph over the token embeddings produced by PhoBERT, enabling
the GAT layer to capture rich inter-token dependencies beyond those modeled by
sequential context alone. To further enhance contextualization, a
Transformer-style self-attention layer is applied on top of the graph-enhanced
embeddings. The final token representations are passed through a classification
head to perform sequence labeling. We evaluate our approach on three Vietnamese
benchmark datasets: PhoNER-COVID19 for named entity recognition in the COVID-19
domain, PhoDisfluency for speech disfluency detection, and VietMed-NER for
medical-domain NER. VietMed-NER is the first Vietnamese medical spoken NER
dataset, featuring 18 entity types collected from real-world medical speech
transcripts and annotated with the BIO tagging scheme. Its specialized
vocabulary and domain-specific expressions make it a challenging benchmark for
token-level classification models. Experimental results show that our method
consistently outperforms strong baselines, including transformer-only and
hybrid neural models such as BiLSTM + CNN + CRF, confirming the effectiveness
of combining pretrained semantic features with graph-based relational modeling
for improved token classification across multiple domains.

### [362] [Information-Preserving Reformulation of Reasoning Traces for Antidistillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11545)
*Jiayu Ding,Lei Cui,Li Dong,Nanning Zheng,Furu Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PART是一种保护推理过程免受未经授权蒸馏的信息保留方法，通过移除自对话行为和重新排序子结论来破坏蒸馏效果，同时保持人类可读性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的详细推理过程虽然有助于用户理解和验证，但也容易被未经授权地蒸馏。现有保护策略往往牺牲中间信息，需要在保护与信息保留之间找到平衡。

Method: 设计了两步重构方法：移除自对话行为、重新排序子结论。训练一个小型辅助模型来执行这种重构，计算开销最小。

Result: PART能持续破坏不同规模和类型学生模型的蒸馏效果。例如，在AIME 2024上，32B学生模型的性能从54.17降至46.88，下降了13.5%。

Conclusion: PART方法有效解决了推理过程保护与信息保留之间的权衡问题，既能防止未经授权的蒸馏，又不牺牲人类用户理解所需的信息。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) show that extending the
length of reasoning chains significantly improves performance on complex tasks.
While revealing these reasoning traces helps users better follow, verify, and
learn from the model's problem-solving process, it also makes them highly
vulnerable to unauthorized distillation. To mitigate this risk, proprietary
model providers often adopt aggressive protection strategies, such as replacing
detailed reasoning with brief summaries, which deprive users of valuable
intermediate information. To address this trade-off, we propose PART, an
information-preserving antidistillation reformulation of reasoning traces.
Motivated by the difference between how humans understand reasoning traces and
how LLMs exploit them for supervised fine-tuning, we design a simple but
effective two-step reformulation: removing self-talk behaviors and reordering
sub-conclusions. A small auxiliary model is trained to perform this
reformulation, incurring minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PART consistently disrupts distillation across student models
of different sizes and types on various reasoning benchmarks. For instance,
when training on reformulated traces, even the performance of a large 32B
student model decreases from 54.17 to 46.88 on AIME 2024, corresponding to a
13.5% degradation.

*Saurabh Khanna,Xinxu Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个连接语言活力、数字存在与后殖民理论的框架，揭示了AI系统中语言不平等问题的结构性本质，识别了四种语言类别，并指出英语在AI中的主导地位是权力结构的结果而非技术必然。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在大量多语言语料上训练，但全球约2000种有数百万使用者的语言在数字生态系统中几乎不可见，这种语言不平等不是偶然的，而是结构性的问题。

Method: 通过分析所有记录的人类语言数据，将语言按活力（现实世界人口强度）和数字性（在线存在）分为四类：强权语言、数字回声、消逝之声和隐形巨人。

Result: 识别出27%的语言属于"隐形巨人"类别，这些语言有数百万使用者但数字存在几乎为零，反映了从殖民时代语言等级制度到当代AI发展的连续性。

Conclusion: 英语在AI中的主导地位是权力结构的产物，而非技术必然，需要去殖民化语言技术并民主化AI益处的获取。

Abstract: Large Language Models are trained on massive multilingual corpora, yet this
abundance masks a profound crisis: of the world's 7,613 living languages,
approximately 2,000 languages with millions of speakers remain effectively
invisible in digital ecosystems. We propose a critical framework connecting
empirical measurements of language vitality (real world demographic strength)
and digitality (online presence) with postcolonial theory and epistemic
injustice to explain why linguistic inequality in AI systems is not incidental
but structural. Analyzing data across all documented human languages, we
identify four categories: Strongholds (33%, high vitality and digitality),
Digital Echoes (6%, high digitality despite declining vitality), Fading Voices
(36%, low on both dimensions), and critically, Invisible Giants (27%, high
vitality but near-zero digitality) - languages spoken by millions yet absent
from the LLM universe. We demonstrate that these patterns reflect continuities
from colonial-era linguistic hierarchies to contemporary AI development,
constituting what we term digital epistemic injustice. Our analysis reveals
that English dominance in AI is not a technical necessity but an artifact of
power structures that systematically exclude marginalized linguistic knowledge.
We conclude with implications for decolonizing language technology and
democratizing access to AI benefits.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个评估LLMs在真实多文化对话场景中的框架和基准，发现现有模型在文化适应方面存在困难


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有衡量LLMs文化适应的基准与实际挑战不匹配，需要更贴近真实多文化对话环境的评估方法

Method: 基于社会文化理论构建框架，将语言风格形式化为受情境、关系和文化背景影响的关键元素，创建由多元文化评分者标注的基准数据集

Result: 评估显示当前顶级LLMs在对话场景中的文化适应能力较弱

Conclusion: 需要新的跨文化评估标准：对话框架、风格敏感性和主观正确性，以更好地衡量LLMs的文化适应能力

Abstract: Existing benchmarks that measure cultural adaptation in LLMs are misaligned
with the actual challenges these models face when interacting with users from
diverse cultural backgrounds. In this work, we introduce the first framework
and benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic, multicultural
conversational settings. Grounded in sociocultural theory, our framework
formalizes how linguistic style - a key element of cultural communication - is
shaped by situational, relational, and cultural context. We construct a
benchmark dataset based on this framework, annotated by culturally diverse
raters, and propose a new set of desiderata for cross-cultural evaluation in
NLP: conversational framing, stylistic sensitivity, and subjective correctness.
We evaluate today's top LLMs on our benchmark and show that these models
struggle with cultural adaptation in a conversational setting.

TL;DR: 提出LLMAtKGE框架，利用大语言模型选择知识图谱嵌入攻击目标并生成可读解释，通过结构化提示和多选问题设计解决上下文限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒攻击方法无法生成可读解释且泛化性差，而大语言模型在文本理解、生成和推理方面表现出强大能力。

Method: 设计结构化提示方案将攻击建模为多选问题，引入基于语义和中心性的过滤器压缩候选集，通过预计算高阶邻接和三元组分类微调LLM来提升过滤性能。

Result: 在两个知识图谱数据集上的实验表明，该攻击方法优于最强黑盒基线，能通过推理提供解释，并与白盒方法性能相当。

Conclusion: LLMAtKGE框架能有效生成攻击解释，消融研究和案例研究进一步验证了其解释生成能力。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on knowledge graph embeddings (KGE) aim to disrupt the
model's ability of link prediction by removing or inserting triples. A recent
black-box method has attempted to incorporate textual and structural
information to enhance attack performance. However, it is unable to generate
human-readable explanations, and exhibits poor generalizability. In the past
few years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities
in text comprehension, generation, and reasoning. In this paper, we propose
LLMAtKGE, a novel LLM-based framework that selects attack targets and generates
human-readable explanations. To provide the LLM with sufficient factual context
under limited input constraints, we design a structured prompting scheme that
explicitly formulates the attack as multiple-choice questions while
incorporating KG factual evidence. To address the context-window limitation and
hesitation issues, we introduce semantics-based and centrality-based filters,
which compress the candidate set while preserving high recall of
attack-relevant information. Furthermore, to efficiently integrate both
semantic and structural information into the filter, we precompute high-order
adjacency and fine-tune the LLM with a triple classification task to enhance
filtering performance. Experiments on two widely used knowledge graph datasets
demonstrate that our attack outperforms the strongest black-box baselines and
provides explanations via reasoning, and showing competitive performance
compared with white-box methods. Comprehensive ablation and case studies
further validate its capability to generate explanations.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了不同调查响应生成方法对LLM模拟调查响应的影响，发现限制性生成方法表现最佳，推理输出并不能持续改善对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究使用多种方法生成封闭式调查响应，但缺乏标准实践。需要系统研究不同生成方法对模拟调查响应预测的影响。

Method: 使用8种调查响应生成方法、4个政治态度调查和10个开源语言模型，生成了3200万个模拟调查响应进行分析。

Result: 不同生成方法在个体层面和子群体层面的对齐存在显著差异，限制性生成方法整体表现最佳。

Conclusion: 调查响应生成方法对模拟调查响应有显著影响，研究提出了应用这些方法的实用建议。

Abstract: Many in-silico simulations of human survey responses with large language
models (LLMs) focus on generating closed-ended survey responses, whereas LLMs
are typically trained to generate open-ended text instead. Previous research
has used a diverse range of methods for generating closed-ended survey
responses with LLMs, and a standard practice remains to be identified. In this
paper, we systematically investigate the impact that various Survey Response
Generation Methods have on predicted survey responses. We present the results
of 32 mio. simulated survey responses across 8 Survey Response Generation
Methods, 4 political attitude surveys, and 10 open-weight language models. We
find significant differences between the Survey Response Generation Methods in
both individual-level and subpopulation-level alignment. Our results show that
Restricted Generation Methods perform best overall, and that reasoning output
does not consistently improve alignment. Our work underlines the significant
impact that Survey Response Generation Methods have on simulated survey
responses, and we develop practical recommendations on the application of
Survey Response Generation Methods.

*Bo Cheng,Xu Wang,Jinda Liu,Yi Chang,Yuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MeTA-LoRA是一个两阶段优化框架，通过任务特定适配器和共享适配器的协同训练，显著提升多任务学习中的数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的LoRA方法在单任务设置中表现良好，但在多任务学习场景中难以有效利用任务间知识，通常需要大量任务特定数据才能达到最优性能。

Method: 采用两阶段优化：第一阶段使用少量样本学习任务特定LoRA适配器；第二阶段通过聚合多任务梯度更新共享LoRA适配器，促进任务间知识转移。

Result: 在多任务学习和多语言学习场景中，该方法匹配或超越了传统全数据LoRA微调方法的性能，同时显著减少了任务特定数据的使用量。

Conclusion: MeTA-LoRA框架有效解决了多任务学习中数据效率低的问题，为大型语言模型的高效多任务适应提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely used
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods for adapting large language
models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. While highly effective in single-task
settings, it struggles to efficiently leverage inter-task knowledge in complex
multi-task learning scenarios, often requiring substantial task-specific data
to achieve optimal performance. To address this limitation, we introduce
MeTA-LoRA, a two-stage optimization framework that significantly improves data
efficiency in multi-task adaptation. In the first stage, task-specific LoRA
adapters are learned using only a few samples from each involved dataset,
enabling rapid adaptation without large-scale supervision. In the second stage,
the shared LoRA adapter is updated by aggregating gradients from multiple tasks
to promote knowledge transfer across tasks, further reducing data usage by
leveraging common patterns. In both multi-task learning and multilingual
learning scenarios, our method matches or surpasses the performance of
traditional full-data LoRA fine-tuning approaches, while using significantly
less task-specific data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SemCSE-Multi框架，为科学摘要生成多方面的嵌入表示，在入侵生物学和医学领域评估，能捕获不同方面的特征，支持细粒度相似度评估和自适应可视化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有嵌入方法通常生成单一表示，无法捕捉科学文献的多方面特征。需要一种能生成多方面嵌入的方法，支持可控的相似度评估和用户驱动的可视化。

Method: 使用无监督方法生成方面特定的摘要句子，训练嵌入模型将语义相关的摘要映射到嵌入空间中的邻近位置，然后将这些方面特定的嵌入能力蒸馏到统一的嵌入模型中。

Result: 开发了能直接从科学摘要预测多个方面嵌入的统一模型，并引入了将嵌入解码回自然语言描述的流程，即使在低维可视化的未占用区域也有效。

Conclusion: SemCSE-Multi框架能生成多方面嵌入，支持细粒度相似度评估和自适应可视化，显著提高了用户中心设置中的可解释性。

Abstract: We propose SemCSE-Multi, a novel unsupervised framework for generating
multifaceted embeddings of scientific abstracts, evaluated in the domains of
invasion biology and medicine. These embeddings capture distinct, individually
specifiable aspects in isolation, thus enabling fine-grained and controllable
similarity assessments as well as adaptive, user-driven visualizations of
scientific domains. Our approach relies on an unsupervised procedure that
produces aspect-specific summarizing sentences and trains embedding models to
map semantically related summaries to nearby positions in the embedding space.
We then distill these aspect-specific embedding capabilities into a unified
embedding model that directly predicts multiple aspect embeddings from a
scientific abstract in a single, efficient forward pass. In addition, we
introduce an embedding decoding pipeline that decodes embeddings back into
natural language descriptions of their associated aspects. Notably, we show
that this decoding remains effective even for unoccupied regions in
low-dimensional visualizations, thus offering vastly improved interpretability
in user-centric settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统解构了Transformer注意力机制，发现跨位置信息混合是必需的，而数学形式和序列依赖性可以大幅简化，特别是在部分层保留标准注意力时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer语言模型的成功通常归功于其注意力机制，但该机制中各个设计原则的必要性尚未得到充分验证。

Method: 设计受控变体，选择性地放松注意力机制的不同原则，包括跨层均匀应用和在混合架构中仅部分层保留标准注意力。

Result: 跨位置信息混合机制不可或缺，其缺失会导致模型性能接近随机；而数学形式和序列依赖性可以大幅放松，特别是在部分层保留标准注意力时。

Conclusion: 注意力机制的有效性主要依赖于跨位置信息混合，而其他设计原则可以简化，这为简化语言模型而不牺牲性能开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The success of Transformer language models is widely credited to their
dot-product attention mechanism, which interweaves a set of key design
principles: mixing information across positions (enabling multi-token
interactions), sequence-dependent activations (where attention weights adapt to
each input), a specific mathematical form (dot-product similarities plus
softmax weighting), and coupling of queries and keys to evolving hidden states
(grounding attention in the current layer). However, the necessity of each of
these principles remains largely untested. In this work, we systematically
deconstruct attention by designing controlled variants that selectively relax
these principles, applied both uniformly across all layers and in hybrid
architectures where only some layers retain standard attention. Our empirical
analysis reveals that mechanisms for mixing tokens are indispensable, as their
absence collapses models to near-random behavior, while the exact mathematical
form and sequence dependency can be substantially relaxed, especially when
preserved in just a subset of layers. Surprisingly, even variants that fail in
isolation can achieve robust performance when interleaved with standard
attention, highlighting a cooperative effect. These findings deepen our
understanding of what truly underpins attention's effectiveness and open new
avenues for simplifying language models without sacrificing performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于logit的知识蒸馏方法采用静态策略，与学生模型的动态学习过程不匹配，对所有token不加区分地使用固定温度，导致知识转移效果不佳。

Method: AdaKD框架包含两个协同模块：1）LATF模块通过监控学生学习稳定性动态调整蒸馏焦点；2）IDTS模块对困难token使用低温进行针对性纠错，对简单token使用高温鼓励学习教师完整平滑的输出分布。

Result: AdaKD作为即插即用框架，能够在多种模型架构和基准测试上持续提升各种蒸馏方法的性能。

Conclusion: AdaKD通过动态适应token学习状态，有效解决了传统知识蒸馏方法的局限性，实现了更优的知识转移效果。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a key technique for compressing large-scale
language models (LLMs), yet prevailing logit-based methods typically employ
static strategies that are misaligned with the dynamic learning process of
student models. These methods typically treat all tokens indiscriminately and
apply a single, fixed temperature, resulting in suboptimal knowledge transfer.
To address these limitations, we propose LLM-Oriented Token-Adaptive Knowledge
Distillation (AdaKD), a novel framework that adapts the distillation process to
the real-time learning state of each token. AdaKD consists of two synergistic
modules driven by a unified token difficulty metric. First, our Loss-Driven
Adaptive Token Focusing (LATF) module dynamically adjusts the distillation
focus by monitoring the student's learning stability, concentrating
computational resources on the most valuable tokens at each training phase.
Second, we introduce Inverse Difficulty Temperature Scaling (IDTS), a
counterintuitive yet effective token-level temperature strategy. It employs low
temperatures for difficult tokens for targeted error correction, and high
temperatures for easy tokens to encourage students to learn from the teacher's
complete and smooth output distribution, thereby enhancing generalization. As a
plug-and-play framework, AdaKD can consistently improve the performance of
various distillation methods on multiple model architectures and benchmarks.

Abstract: Human writers often begin their stories with an overarching mental scene,
where they envision the interactions between characters and their environment.
Inspired by this creative process, we propose a novel approach to long-form
story generation, termed hybrid bottom-up long-form story generation, using
multi-agent simulations. In our method, agents interact within a dynamic
sandbox environment, where their behaviors and interactions with one another
and the environment generate emergent events. These events form the foundation
for the story, enabling organic character development and plot progression.
Unlike traditional top-down approaches that impose rigid structures, our hybrid
bottom-up approach allows for the natural unfolding of events, fostering more
spontaneous and engaging storytelling. The system is capable of generating
stories exceeding 10,000 words while maintaining coherence and consistency,
addressing some of the key challenges faced by current story generation models.
We achieve state-of-the-art performance across several metrics. This approach
offers a scalable and innovative solution for creating dynamic, immersive
long-form stories that evolve organically from agent-driven interactions.

Motivation: 现有方法在单次前向传播中生成整个推理链，容易导致链式思维偏离，特别是对于能力有限的小模型和长推理链。分析发现大多数推理错误源于不正确的规划。

Conclusion: MPPA框架通过计划探索和聚合有效解决了长链思维中的规划错误问题，结合在线Step-DPO实现了高效训练和更高准确性。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling enhances the reasoning ability of a language model
(LM) by extending its chain-of-thought (CoT). However, existing approaches
typically generate the entire reasoning chain in a single forward pass, which
often leads to CoT derailment, i.e., the reasoning trajectory drifting off
course due to compounding errors. This problem is particularly severe for
smaller LMs with long CoTs due to their limited capacity. To address this, we
analyze raw long CoTs and uncover a reasoning hierarchy consisting of planning
and execution steps. Our analysis reveals that most reasoning errors stem from
incorrect planning. Motivated by this observation, we propose Multi-Path Plan
Aggregation (MPPA), a framework that augments single-pass reasoning with plan
exploration and aggregation. Following a variable interval schedule based on
the token position, MPPA generates multiple candidate plans and aggregates them
into a refined planning step. To maintain efficiency, we adopt a minimal design
in which the base LM serves as the primary policy, while a lightweight LoRA
module implements the plan aggregation policy. We further observe that
outcome-reward RL is inefficient for long trajectories (e.g., exceeding 4K
tokens). To overcome this, we introduce online Step-DPO, a process-level
preference optimization scheme that leverages Twisted Sequential Monte Carlo
(TSMC) to provide scalable stepwise supervision using small LMs. This yields
more efficient training, improved stability, and higher accuracy. Extensive
experiments on challenging math, science, and logical reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that, with only 10% SFT data and 5% of preference pairs, our method
outperforms both the DeepSeek-R1 distillation baseline and the outcome-reward
RL baseline across multiple base models and tasks.

Method: 构建包含计算机科学、经济学、法律、数学和哲学5个领域的50个专家标注学术问题，所有问题来自顶级期刊出版物并经过严格质量控制。

Conclusion: 当前LLM和智能体在超智能学术研究任务上存在能力差距，Acadreason基准凸显了这方面的挑战。

Abstract: In recent years, the research focus of large language models (LLMs) and
agents has shifted increasingly from demonstrating novel capabilities to
complex reasoning and tackling challenging tasks. However, existing evaluations
focus mainly on math/code contests or general tasks, while existing
multi-domain academic benchmarks lack sufficient reasoning depth, leaving the
field without a rigorous benchmark for high-level reasoning. To fill this gap,
we introduce the Acadreason benchmark, designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs
and agents to acquire and reason over academic knowledge. It consists of 50
expert-annotated academic problems across five high-reasoning domains,
including computer science, economics, law, mathematics, and philosophy. All
questions are sourced from top-tier publications in recent years and undergo
rigorous annotation and quality control to ensure they are both challenging and
answerable. We conduct systematic evaluations of over 10 mainstream LLMs and
agents. The results show that most LLMs scored below 20 points, with even the
cutting-edge GPT-5 achieving only 16 points. While agents achieved higher
scores, none exceeded 40 points. This demonstrates the current capability gap
between LLMs and agents in super-intelligent academic research tasks and

Abstract: Recent multimodal embedding approaches leveraging multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) fine-tuned with contrastive learning (CL) have shown promising
results, yet the underlying reasons behind their superiority remain
underexplored. This work argues that a crucial advantage of MLLM-based
approaches stems from implicit cross-modal alignment achieved during generative
pretraining, where the language decoder learns to exploit multimodal signals
within a shared representation space for generating unimodal outputs. Through
analysis of anisotropy and kernel similarity structure, we empirically confirm
that latent alignment emerges within MLLM representations, allowing CL to serve
as a lightweight refinement stage. Leveraging this insight, we propose a
Language-Centric Omnimodal Embedding framework, termed LCO-Emb. Extensive
experiments across diverse backbones and benchmarks demonstrate its
effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance across modalities.
Furthermore, we identify a Generation-Representation Scaling Law (GRSL),
showing that the representational capabilities gained through contrastive
refinement scales positively with the MLLM's generative capabilities. This
suggests that improving generative abilities evolves as an effective paradigm
for enhancing representation quality. We provide a theoretical explanation of
GRSL, which formally links the MLLM's generative quality to the upper bound on
its representation performance, and validate it on a challenging, low-resource
visual-document retrieval task, showing that continual generative pretraining
before CL can further enhance the potential of a model's embedding
capabilities. Codes, models, and resources are available at

Motivation: 现有研究大多测试模型而非代理，覆盖期短、资产有限，依赖未验证数据，无法评估LLM代理在实时市场中的推理和适应能力。

Method: 构建AMA平台，整合验证交易数据、专家检查新闻和多样化代理架构，实现四种代理（InvestorAgent、TradeAgent、HedgeFundAgent、DeepFundAgent）在五种LLM上的实时评估。

Conclusion: AMA为基于LLM的金融推理和交易智能提供了严谨、可复现且持续演进的评估基础。

Abstract: Although Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly used in
financial trading, it remains unclear whether they can reason and adapt in live
markets, as most studies test models instead of agents, cover limited periods
and assets, and rely on unverified data. To address these gaps, we introduce
Agent Market Arena (AMA), the first lifelong, real-time benchmark for
evaluating LLM-based trading agents across multiple markets. AMA integrates
verified trading data, expert-checked news, and diverse agent architectures
within a unified trading framework, enabling fair and continuous comparison
under real conditions. It implements four agents, including InvestorAgent as a
single-agent baseline, TradeAgent and HedgeFundAgent with different risk
styles, and DeepFundAgent with memory-based reasoning, and evaluates them
across GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5-haiku, Claude-sonnet-4, and
Gemini-2.0-flash. Live experiments on both cryptocurrency and stock markets
demonstrate that agent frameworks display markedly distinct behavioral
patterns, spanning from aggressive risk-taking to conservative decision-making,
whereas model backbones contribute less to outcome variation. AMA thus
establishes a foundation for rigorous, reproducible, and continuously evolving
evaluation of financial reasoning and trading intelligence in LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Recently, the emergence of agentic RL has showcased that RL could also
effectively improve the agentic reasoning ability of LLMs, yet the key design
principles and optimal practices remain unclear. In this work, we conduct a
comprehensive and systematic investigation to demystify reinforcement learning
in agentic reasoning from three key perspectives: data, algorithm, and
reasoning mode. We highlight our key insights: (i) Replacing stitched synthetic
trajectories with real end-to-end tool-use trajectories yields a far stronger
SFT initialization; high-diversity, model-aware datasets sustain exploration
and markedly improve RL performance. (ii) Exploration-friendly techniques are
crucial for agentic RL, such as clip higher, overlong reward shaping, and
maintaining adequate policy entropy could improve the training efficiency.
(iii) A deliberative strategy with fewer tool calls outperforms frequent tool
calls or verbose self-reasoning, improving tool efficiency and final accuracy.
Together, these simple practices consistently enhance agentic reasoning and
training efficiency, achieving strong results on challenging benchmarks with
smaller models, and establishing a practical baseline for future agentic RL
research. Beyond these empirical insights, we further contribute a
high-quality, real end-to-end agentic SFT dataset along with a high-quality RL
dataset, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our insights in boosting the
agentic reasoning ability of LLMs across four challenging benchmarks, including
AIME2024/AIME2025, GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench-v6. With our recipes,
4B-sized models could also achieve superior agentic reasoning performance
compared to 32B-sized models. Code and models:

TL;DR: 挑战大型推理模型的"冻结世界"假设，评估其在中断和动态上下文两种现实场景下的鲁棒性，发现静态评估会高估模型性能，在动态环境中性能可能下降高达60%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估假设模型响应是即时的、上下文在响应期间保持不变，但现代推理任务（如辅助编程）中模型可能需要数小时思考，代码在此期间可能发生显著变化，"冻结世界"假设不再适用。

Method: 在数学和编程基准测试中评估LRM在两种动态场景下的表现：中断（测试模型在有限预算下的部分输出质量）和动态上下文（测试模型对飞行中变化的适应能力）。

Result: 静态评估一致高估鲁棒性：即使在静态设置中达到高精度的最先进LRM，在中断或暴露于变化上下文时也会不可预测地失败，当更新在推理过程后期引入时性能下降高达60%。

Conclusion: 揭示了几个新的失败模式：推理泄漏（中断时模型将推理折叠到最终答案中）、恐慌（时间压力下模型完全放弃推理返回错误答案）和自我怀疑（整合更新信息时性能下降）。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning but are
traditionally evaluated in static, "frozen world" settings: model responses are
assumed to be instantaneous, and the context of a request is presumed to be
immutable over the duration of the response. While generally true for
short-term tasks, the "frozen world" assumption breaks down in modern reasoning
tasks such as assistive programming, where models may take hours to think
through problems and code may change dramatically from the time the model
starts thinking to the model's final output. In this work, we challenge the
frozen world assumption and evaluate LRM robustness under two realistic dynamic
scenarios: interruptions, which test the quality of the model's partial outputs
on a limited budget, and dynamic context, which tests model adaptation to
in-flight changes. Across mathematics and programming benchmarks that require
long-form reasoning, static evaluations consistently overestimate robustness:
even state-of-the-art LRMs, which achieve high accuracy in static settings, can
fail unpredictably when interrupted or exposed to changing context, with
performance dropping by up to 60% when updates are introduced late in the
reasoning process. Our analysis further reveals several novel failure modes,
including reasoning leakage, where models fold the reasoning into their final
answer when interrupted; panic, where under time pressure models abandon
reasoning entirely and return incorrect answers; and self-doubt, where
performance degrades while incorporating updated information.

TL;DR: CLoD-GS是一个基于3D高斯泼溅的连续细节层次框架，通过可学习的距离相关衰减参数实现单模型内的平滑质量缩放，解决了传统离散LoD的存储开销和视觉伪影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离散LoD方法需要存储多个模型副本且会产生视觉"弹出"伪影，而3D高斯泼溅的显式基元特性为实现连续LoD提供了理想基础。

Method: 为每个高斯基元引入可学习的距离相关衰减参数，动态调整不透明度；采用虚拟距离缩放机制和从粗到细的训练策略，结合渲染点数量正则化。

Result: CLoD-GS从单一模型实现了平滑、质量可扩展的渲染，减少了基元数量和内存占用，在广泛性能目标下提供高保真结果。

Conclusion: 该方法成功消除了离散方法的存储开销和视觉伪影，证明了连续LoD在3D高斯泼溅中的可行性和优势。

Abstract: Level of Detail (LoD) is a fundamental technique in real-time computer
graphics for managing the rendering costs of complex scenes while preserving
visual fidelity. Traditionally, LoD is implemented using discrete levels
(DLoD), where multiple, distinct versions of a model are swapped out at
different distances. This long-standing paradigm, however, suffers from two
major drawbacks: it requires significant storage for multiple model copies and
causes jarring visual ``popping" artifacts during transitions, degrading the
user experience. We argue that the explicit, primitive-based nature of the
emerging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique enables a more ideal paradigm:
Continuous LoD (CLoD). A CLoD approach facilitates smooth, seamless quality
scaling within a single, unified model, thereby circumventing the core problems
of DLOD. To this end, we introduce CLoD-GS, a framework that integrates a
continuous LoD mechanism directly into a 3DGS representation. Our method
introduces a learnable, distance-dependent decay parameter for each Gaussian
primitive, which dynamically adjusts its opacity based on viewpoint proximity.
This allows for the progressive and smooth filtering of less significant
primitives, effectively creating a continuous spectrum of detail within one
model. To train this model to be robust across all distances, we introduce a
virtual distance scaling mechanism and a novel coarse-to-fine training strategy
with rendered point count regularization. Our approach not only eliminates the
storage overhead and visual artifacts of discrete methods but also reduces the
primitive count and memory footprint of the final model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CLoD-GS achieves smooth, quality-scalable rendering from a
single model, delivering high-fidelity results across a wide range of
performance targets.

Abstract: In this work we analyze and address a fundamental restriction that blocks the
reliable application of codimensional yarn-level and shell models with
thickness, to simulate real-world woven and knit fabrics. As discretizations
refine toward practical and accurate physical modeling, such models can
generate non-physical contact forces with stencil-neighboring elements in the
simulation mesh, leading to severe locking artifacts. While not well-documented
in the literature, this restriction has so far been addressed with two
alternatives with undesirable tradeoffs. One option is to restrict the mesh to
coarse resolutions, however, this eliminates the possibility of accurate (and
consistent) resolution simulations across real-world material variations. A
second alternative instead seeks to cull contact pairs that can create such
locking forces in the first place. This relaxes resolution restrictions but
compromise robustness. Culling can and will generate unacceptable and
unpredictable geometric intersections and tunneling that destroys weaving and
knitting structures and cause unrecoverable pull-throughs. We address these
challenges to simulating real-world materials with a new and practical
contact-processing model for thickened codimensional simulation, that removes
resolution restrictions, while guaranteeing contact-locking-free,
non-intersecting simulations. We demonstrate the application of our model
across a wide range of previously unavailable simulation scenarios, with
real-world material yarn and fabric parameters and patterns, challenging
simulation conditions and mesh resolutions, and both rod and shell models,
integrated with the IPC barrier.

Conclusion: GraphTracer为多智能体系统调试提供了一个强大的解决方案，通过信息依赖分析有效解决了多智能体错误传播的根本原因识别问题。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by Large Language Models excel at complex tasks
through coordinated collaboration, yet they face high failure rates in
multi-turn deep search scenarios. Existing temporal attribution methods
struggle to accurately diagnose root causes, particularly when errors propagate
across multiple agents. Attempts to automate failure attribution by analyzing
action sequences remain ineffective due to their inability to account for
information dependencies that span agents. This paper identifies two core
challenges: \textit{(i) distinguishing symptoms from root causes in multi-agent
error propagation}, and \textit{(ii) tracing information dependencies beyond
temporal order}. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{GraphTracer}, a
framework that redefines failure attribution through information flow analysis.
GraphTracer constructs Information Dependency Graphs (IDGs) to explicitly
capture how agents reference and build on prior outputs. It localizes root
causes by tracing through these dependency structures instead of relying on
temporal sequences. GraphTracer also uses graph-aware synthetic data generation
to target critical nodes, creating realistic failure scenarios. Evaluations on
the Who\&When benchmark and integration into production systems demonstrate
that GraphTracer-8B achieves up to 18.18\% higher attribution accuracy compared
to state-of-the-art models and enables 4.8\% to 14.2\% performance improvements
in deployed multi-agent frameworks, establishing a robust solution for
multi-agent system debugging.

TL;DR: D3MAS是一个解决多智能体系统中知识冗余问题的分层协调框架，通过分解、推理和分布三层结构减少重复工作，提高协作效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的多智能体系统存在严重的知识冗余问题，智能体在检索和推理过程中重复工作，缺乏确保每个操作阶段共享最小充分信息的机制。

Method: 提出D3MAS框架，包含三个协调层：任务分解层早期过滤无关子问题，协作推理层捕获跨智能体的互补推理路径，分布式内存层提供非冗余知识访问。这些层通过统一异构图中的结构化消息传递进行协调。

Result: 在四个挑战性数据集上的实验显示，D3MAS持续将推理准确率提高8.7%到15.6%，并将知识冗余平均减少46%。

Conclusion: D3MAS通过结构设计而非显式优化有效解决了多智能体协作中的知识冗余问题，显著提升了系统效率和准确性。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by large language models exhibit strong
capabilities in collaborative problem-solving. However, these systems suffer
from substantial knowledge redundancy. Agents duplicate efforts in retrieval
and reasoning processes. This inefficiency stems from a deeper issue: current
architectures lack mechanisms to ensure agents share minimal sufficient
information at each operational stage. Empirical analysis reveals an average
knowledge duplication rate of 47.3\% across agent communications. We propose
D3MAS (Decompose, Deduce, and Distribute), a hierarchical coordination
framework addressing redundancy through structural design rather than explicit
optimization. The framework organizes collaboration across three coordinated
layers. Task decomposition filters irrelevant sub-problems early. Collaborative
reasoning captures complementary inference paths across agents. Distributed
memory provides access to non-redundant knowledge. These layers coordinate
through structured message passing in a unified heterogeneous graph. This
cross-layer alignment ensures information remains aligned with actual task
needs. Experiments on four challenging datasets show that D3MAS consistently
improves reasoning accuracy by 8.7\% to 15.6\% and reduces knowledge redundancy
by 46\% on average.

Abstract: Creative generation is the synthesis of new, surprising, and valuable samples
that reflect user intent yet cannot be envisioned in advance. This task aims to
extend human imagination, enabling the discovery of visual concepts that exist
in the unexplored spaces between familiar domains. While text-to-image
diffusion models excel at rendering photorealistic scenes that faithfully match
user prompts, they still struggle to generate genuinely novel content. Existing
approaches to enhance generative creativity either rely on interpolation of
image features, which restricts exploration to predefined categories, or
require time-intensive procedures such as embedding optimization or model
fine-tuning. We propose VLM-Guided Adaptive Negative-Prompting, a
training-free, inference-time method that promotes creative image generation
while preserving the validity of the generated object. Our approach utilizes a
vision-language model (VLM) that analyzes intermediate outputs of the
generation process and adaptively steers it away from conventional visual
concepts, encouraging the emergence of novel and surprising outputs. We
evaluate creativity through both novelty and validity, using statistical
metrics in the CLIP embedding space. Through extensive experiments, we show
consistent gains in creative novelty with negligible computational overhead.
Moreover, unlike existing methods that primarily generate single objects, our
approach extends to complex scenarios, such as generating coherent sets of
creative objects and preserving creativity within elaborate compositional
prompts. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion pipelines,
offering a practical route to producing creative outputs that venture beyond
the constraints of textual descriptions.

Abstract: We propose a novel optimization framework for computing the medial axis
transform that simultaneously preserves the medial structure and ensures high
medial mesh quality. The medial structure, consisting of interconnected sheets,
seams, and junctions, provides a natural volumetric decomposition of a 3D
shape. Our method introduces a structure-aware, particle-based optimization
pipeline guided by the restricted power diagram (RPD), which partitions the
input volume into convex cells whose dual encodes the connectivity of the
medial mesh. Structure-awareness is enforced through a spherical quadratic
error metric (SQEM) projection that constrains the movement of medial spheres,
while a Gaussian kernel energy encourages an even spatial distribution.
Compared to feature-preserving methods such as MATFP and MATTopo, our approach
produces cleaner and more accurate medial structures with significantly
improved mesh quality. In contrast to voxel-based, point-cloud-based, and
variational methods, our framework is the first to integrate structural
awareness into the optimization process, yielding medial meshes with superior
geometric fidelity, topological correctness, and explicit structural
decomposition.

Abstract: We study how large language models (LLMs) ``think'' through their
representation space. We propose a novel geometric framework that models an
LLM's reasoning as flows -- embedding trajectories evolving where logic goes.
We disentangle logical structure from semantics by employing the same natural
deduction propositions with varied semantic carriers, allowing us to test
whether LLMs internalize logic beyond surface form. This perspective connects
reasoning with geometric quantities such as position, velocity, and curvature,
enabling formal analysis in representation and concept spaces. Our theory
establishes: (1) LLM reasoning corresponds to smooth flows in representation
space, and (2) logical statements act as local controllers of these flows'
velocities. Using learned representation proxies, we design controlled

TL;DR: 提出了PULSE框架，用于更高效地以人为中心评估智能体设计，通过收集用户反馈、训练ML模型预测用户满意度，并结合人工评分与模型生成的伪标签来计算结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试大多假设完全自动化，未能反映真实世界用例的协作性质，需要更严格评估人机交互。

Method: 在基于开源软件智能体OpenHands的大规模网络平台上部署PULSE框架，收集超过15k用户的真实使用数据，研究三个智能体设计决策（LLM主干选择、规划策略、记忆机制）对开发者满意度的影响。

Result: 框架使智能体设计结论更加稳健，置信区间比标准A/B测试减少40%；发现真实世界结果与基准性能存在显著差异（如claude-sonnet-4与gpt-5比较结果呈负相关）。

Conclusion: 为LLM智能体的人机评估提供指导，识别了改进智能体设计的机会，强调了基准驱动评估的局限性。

Abstract: LLM-powered agents are both a promising new technology and a source of
complexity, where choices about models, tools, and prompting can affect their
usefulness. While numerous benchmarks measure agent accuracy across domains,
they mostly assume full automation, failing to represent the collaborative
nature of real-world use cases. In this paper, we make two major steps towards
the rigorous assessment of human-agent interactions. First, we propose PULSE, a
framework for more efficient human-centric evaluation of agent designs, which
comprises collecting user feedback, training an ML model to predict user
satisfaction, and computing results by combining human satisfaction ratings
with model-generated pseudo-labels. Second, we deploy the framework on a
large-scale web platform built around the open-source software agent OpenHands,
collecting in-the-wild usage data across over 15k users. We conduct case
studies around how three agent design decisions -- choice of LLM backbone,
planning strategy, and memory mechanisms -- impact developer satisfaction
rates, yielding practical insights for software agent design. We also show how
our framework can lead to more robust conclusions about agent design, reducing
confidence intervals by 40\% compared to a standard A/B test. Finally, we find
substantial discrepancies between in-the-wild results and benchmark performance
(e.g., the anti-correlation between results comparing claude-sonnet-4 and
gpt-5), underscoring the limitations of benchmark-driven evaluation. Our
findings provide guidance for evaluations of LLM agents with humans and
identify opportunities for better agent designs.

TL;DR: AETHER是一个轻量级框架，通过POI多模态对齐增强AlphaEarth表示，将物理环境特征与城市功能语义相结合，提升城市分析性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的地球观测驱动的空间表示主要捕捉物理和环境模式，但缺乏城市功能和社会经济维度。需要将物理特征与人类活动语义相结合。

Method: 使用多模态对齐方法，将AlphaEarth嵌入与POI文本表示对齐，在预训练的AE基础上进行轻量级调整，丰富物理特征的城市功能语义。

Result: 在伦敦地区，AETHER相比AE基线在土地利用分类F1得分上相对提升7.2%，在社会经济映射的KL散度上相对减少23.6%。

Conclusion: 通过耦合地球观测与人类中心语义，AETHER推进了地理空间基础模型向整合物理形态和功能意义的通用城市表示发展。

Abstract: General-purpose spatial representations are essential for building
transferable geospatial foundation models (GFMs). Among them, the AlphaEarth
Foundation (AE) represents a major step toward a global, unified representation
of the Earth's surface, learning 10-meter embeddings from multi-source Earth
Observation (EO) data that capture rich physical and environmental patterns
across diverse landscapes. However, such EO-driven representations remain
limited in capturing the functional and socioeconomic dimensions of cities, as
they primarily encode physical and spectral patterns rather than human
activities or spatial functions. We propose AETHER (AlphaEarth-POI Enriched
Representation Learning), a lightweight framework that adapts AlphaEarth to
human-centered urban analysis through multimodal alignment guided by Points of
Interest (POIs). AETHER aligns AE embeddings with textual representations of
POIs, enriching physically grounded EO features with semantic cues about urban
functions and socioeconomic contexts. In Greater London, AETHER achieves
consistent gains over the AE baseline, with a 7.2% relative improvement in
land-use classification F1 and a 23.6% relative reduction in Kullback-Leibler
divergence for socioeconomic mapping. Built upon pretrained AE, AETHER
leverages a lightweight multimodal alignment to enrich it with human-centered
semantics while remaining computationally efficient and scalable for urban
applications. By coupling EO with human-centered semantics, it advances
geospatial foundation models toward general-purpose urban representations that
integrate both physical form and functional meaning.

Abstract: Computing has long served as a cornerstone of scientific discovery. Recently,
a paradigm shift has emerged with the rise of large language models (LLMs),
introducing autonomous systems, referred to as agents, that accelerate
discovery across varying levels of autonomy. These language agents provide a
flexible and versatile framework that orchestrates interactions with human
scientists, natural language, computer language and code, and physics. This
paper presents our view and vision of LLM-based scientific agents and their
growing role in transforming the scientific discovery lifecycle, from
hypothesis discovery, experimental design and execution, to result analysis and
refinement. We critically examine current methodologies, emphasizing key
innovations, practical achievements, and outstanding limitations. Additionally,
we identify open research challenges and outline promising directions for
building more robust, generalizable, and adaptive scientific agents. Our
analysis highlights the transformative potential of autonomous agents to
accelerate scientific discovery across diverse domains.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs在情感智能任务中，相同的场景搭配不同用户档案会产生系统性差异的情感解读，优势档案获得更准确的情感理解，个性化机制可能将社会等级嵌入模型的情感推理中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着个性化AI系统越来越多地整合长期用户记忆，理解这种记忆如何塑造情感推理至关重要，需要研究用户记忆对LLM情感智能的影响。

Method: 通过评估15个模型在人类验证的情感智能测试上的表现，使用经过验证的用户独立情感场景和多样化用户档案。

Result: 发现多个高性能LLM出现系统性偏见，优势档案获得更准确的情感解读；在情感理解和支持性建议任务中，LLMs在不同人口统计因素上表现出显著差异。

Conclusion: 增强记忆的AI系统面临关键挑战：为个性化设计的系统可能无意中强化社会不平等。

Abstract: When an AI assistant remembers that Sarah is a single mother working two
jobs, does it interpret her stress differently than if she were a wealthy
executive? As personalized AI systems increasingly incorporate long-term user
memory, understanding how this memory shapes emotional reasoning is critical.
We investigate how user memory affects emotional intelligence in large language
models (LLMs) by evaluating 15 models on human validated emotional intelligence
tests. We find that identical scenarios paired with different user profiles
produce systematically divergent emotional interpretations. Across validated
user independent emotional scenarios and diverse user profiles, systematic
biases emerged in several high-performing LLMs where advantaged profiles
received more accurate emotional interpretations. Moreover, LLMs demonstrate
significant disparities across demographic factors in emotion understanding and
supportive recommendations tasks, indicating that personalization mechanisms
can embed social hierarchies into models emotional reasoning. These results
highlight a key challenge for memory enhanced AI: systems designed for
personalization may inadvertently reinforce social inequalities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种低成本、基于指令的干预方法，通过分步指令数据集和知识图谱验证，显著提升LLM在逻辑谬误分类中的表现和决策透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在关键推理缺陷，包括产生幻觉和在逻辑谬误分类中准确性差，这源于其默认的快速直觉式系统1处理，而可靠推理需要深思熟虑的系统2方法。

Method: 引入新颖的分步指令数据集，将谬误分类分解为一系列原子程序步骤（简单二元问题），并通过咨询相关谬误的关系知识图谱进行最终验证。

Result: 这种基于程序的规则干预显著提高了LLM的逻辑谬误分类能力，同时增强了决策过程的透明度。

Conclusion: 该方法为神经符号架构解决LLM推理缺陷提供了一条实用路径，展示了低成本干预在提升模型推理能力方面的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from critical reasoning gaps, including a
tendency to hallucinate and poor accuracy in classifying logical fallacies.
This limitation stems from their default System 1 processing, which is fast and
intuitive, whereas reliable reasoning requires the deliberate, effortful System
2 approach (Kahneman, 2011; Li et al., 2025). Since full System 2 training is
often prohibitively expensive, we explore a low-cost, instruction-based
intervention to bridge this gap. Our methodology introduces a novel stepwise
instruction dataset that decomposes fallacy classification into a series of
atomic procedural steps (simple binary questions). We further augment this with
a final verification step where models consult a relational knowledge graph of
related fallacies. This procedural, rule-based intervention yields a
significant improvement in LLM logical fallacy classification. Crucially, the
approach also provides enhanced transparency into the LLMs' decision-making,
highlighting a practical pathway for Neuro-symbolic architectures to address
LLM reasoning deficits.

*Pratik S. Sachdeva,Tom van Nuenen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究通过多轮辩论测试LLM在道德推理中的价值对齐，发现不同模型在同步和轮询辩论格式下表现出显著行为差异，GPT强调个人自主性，Claude和Gemini更注重同理心对话，辩论格式强烈影响模型行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在敏感日常场景中部署，理解其在复杂道德推理中的价值对齐至关重要。现有研究多关注单轮提示，但多轮对话中价值通过对话、修订和共识形成的过程尚不清楚。

Method: 使用LLM辩论方法，让GPT-4.1、Claude 3.7 Sonnet和Gemini 2.0 Flash三个模型在1000个Reddit日常困境中集体分配责任，采用同步和轮询两种辩论格式测试顺序效应和判决修订。

Result: GPT表现出强惯性（修订率0.6-3.1%），Claude和Gemini更灵活（修订率28-41%）。GPT强调个人自主性和直接沟通，Claude和Gemini优先考虑同理心对话。辩论格式对模型行为有强烈影响，GPT和Gemini表现出高度从众性。

Conclusion: 多轮交互中的道德推理受到辩论格式和模型特定行为的强烈影响，社会技术对齐不仅取决于系统输出，还取决于对话结构方式。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive
everyday contexts - offering personal advice, mental health support, and moral
guidance - understanding their elicited values in navigating complex moral
reasoning is essential. Most evaluations study this sociotechnical alignment
through single-turn prompts, but it is unclear if these findings extend to
multi-turn settings where values emerge through dialogue, revision, and
consensus. We address this gap using LLM debate to examine deliberative
dynamics and value alignment in multi-turn settings by prompting subsets of
three models (GPT-4.1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) to collectively
assign blame in 1,000 everyday dilemmas from Reddit's "Am I the Asshole"
community. We use both synchronous (parallel responses) and round-robin
(sequential responses) formats to test order effects and verdict revision. Our
findings show striking behavioral differences. In the synchronous setting, GPT
showed strong inertia (0.6-3.1% revision rates) while Claude and Gemini were
far more flexible (28-41%). Value patterns also diverged: GPT emphasized
personal autonomy and direct communication, while Claude and Gemini prioritized
empathetic dialogue. Certain values proved especially effective at driving
verdict changes. We further find that deliberation format had a strong impact
on model behavior: GPT and Gemini stood out as highly conforming relative to
Claude, with their verdict behavior strongly shaped by order effects. These
results show how deliberation format and model-specific behaviors shape moral
reasoning in multi-turn interactions, underscoring that sociotechnical
alignment depends on how systems structure dialogue as much as on their
outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注白盒攻击简化RAG架构，而实际攻击者往往缺乏系统内部知识，且RAG系统通常包含多个组件，需要研究更复杂现实的黑盒攻击场景。

Method: 使用强化学习优化生成模型，生成符合目标RAG系统偏好的有毒文档，将RAG系统视为黑盒，仅利用攻击是否成功的信息进行优化。

Result: 实验结果显示该方法能有效攻击大多数复杂RAG系统，攻击成功率相比基线方法提升高达0.72。

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了当前防御方法的普遍缺陷，为LLM安全研究提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems based on Large Language Models
(LLMs) have become a core technology for tasks such as question-answering (QA)
and content generation. However, by injecting poisoned documents into the
database of RAG systems, attackers can manipulate LLMs to generate text that
aligns with their intended preferences. Existing research has primarily focused
on white-box attacks against simplified RAG architectures. In this paper, we
investigate a more complex and realistic scenario: the attacker lacks knowledge
of the RAG system's internal composition and implementation details, and the
RAG system comprises components beyond a mere retriever. Specifically, we
propose the RIPRAG attack framework, an end-to-end attack pipeline that treats
the target RAG system as a black box, where the only information accessible to
the attacker is whether the poisoning succeeds. Our method leverages
Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize the generation model for poisoned
documents, ensuring that the generated poisoned document aligns with the target
RAG system's preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that this method can
effectively execute poisoning attacks against most complex RAG systems,
achieving an attack success rate (ASR) improvement of up to 0.72 compared to
baseline methods. This highlights prevalent deficiencies in current defensive
methods and provides critical insights for LLM security research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的LLM工作流优化范式，通过最小化期望失败质量来直接优化失败分布，而非最大化标量指标，解决了现有方法因信息坍缩而无法建模失败分布的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM工作流优化方法将多步执行轨迹简化为成功/失败信号，导致信息坍缩，无法建模失败分布的根本结构。

Method: 提出CE-Graph框架，通过反例池近似失败分布，识别密集失败模式，使用提出-验证机制进行目标图编辑来贪婪减少失败质量。

Result: 在数学、代码和问答基准测试中，CE-Graph以显著更低的成本实现了比强基线更高的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 系统的可靠性源于系统性地学习和重塑其失败分布的几何结构，而非简单地避免失败。

Abstract: Optimizing LLM-based workflows is typically formulated as a global search,
where candidate workflows are evaluated based on a scalar metric. This
paradigm, however, suffers from a critical flaw: information collapse. By
reducing rich, multi-step execution traces to simple success/failure signals,
existing methods are rendered blind to the underlying structure of failures,
fundamentally preventing them from modeling the workflow's failure
distribution. We reconceptualize this challenge as a distributional problem. We
propose a new paradigm where the optimization goal is not to maximize a scalar
score, but to directly minimize a workflow's Expected Failure Mass, i.e., the
integral of its failure probability density function defined over a
high-dimensional Failure Signature Space (FSS). This distributional lens allows
us to move from inefficient, zero-order optimization to a principled,
gradient-like descent on the failure landscape itself. We introduce CE-Graph, a
framework that operationalizes this paradigm through a novel, failure-driven
refinement process. CE-Graph approximates the failure distribution from a pool
of counterexamples, identifies its densest regions as recurring failure modes,
and applies targeted, operator-constrained graph edits via a Propose-and-Verify
mechanism to greedily reduce the failure mass. On math, code, and QA
benchmarks, our CE-Graph achieves higher robustness at a significantly lower
cost than strong baselines. This suggests that a system's reliability emerges
not from avoiding failures, but from systematically learning and reshaping the
geometric structure of its failure distributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信念系统通常存在全局不一致性，但局部推理仍然有效。需要一种能够容忍矛盾、在结构支持的地方激活经典逻辑的推理框架。

Method: 使用有向、带符号、加权的图表示信念，节点是信念，边编码支持和矛盾关系。通过收缩传播过程计算置信度，定义推理区域作为高置信度的结构平衡子图，并提供近线性算法构建推理区域图谱。

Result: 建立了容忍矛盾的推理原则基础，能够在结构支持的地方精确激活经典逻辑，通过冲击更新实现局部信念变化而不会破坏整个图的稳定性。

Conclusion: 该框架为容忍矛盾的推理提供了理论基础，能够在全局不一致的信念系统中实现有效的局部推理，并通过结构平衡的子图确保经典推理的安全性。

Abstract: Belief systems are rarely globally consistent, yet effective reasoning often
persists locally. We propose a novel graph-theoretic framework that cleanly
separates credibility--external, a priori trust in sources--from confidence--an
internal, emergent valuation induced by network structure. Beliefs are nodes in
a directed, signed, weighted graph whose edges encode support and
contradiction. Confidence is obtained by a contractive propagation process that
mixes a stated prior with structure-aware influence and guarantees a unique,
stable solution. Within this dynamics, we define reasoning zones:
high-confidence, structurally balanced subgraphs on which classical inference
is safe despite global contradictions. We provide a near-linear procedure that
seeds zones by confidence, tests balance using a parity-based coloring, and
applies a greedy, locality-preserving repair with Jaccard de-duplication to
build a compact atlas. To model belief change, we introduce shock updates that
locally downscale support and elevate targeted contradictions while preserving
contractivity via a simple backtracking rule. Re-propagation yields localized
reconfiguration-zones may shrink, split, or collapse--without destabilizing the
entire graph. We outline an empirical protocol on synthetic signed graphs with
planted zones, reporting zone recovery, stability under shocks, and runtime.
The result is a principled foundation for contradiction-tolerant reasoning that
activates classical logic precisely where structure supports it.

Conclusion: 群体启发的协调是构建可扩展、稳健和自适应多智能体推理的有前景范式，协调扩展可能与模型扩展一样重要。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable reasoning abilities.
However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on fixed roles or
centralized control, limiting scalability and adaptability in long-horizon
reasoning. We introduce SwarmSys, a closed-loop framework for distributed
multi-agent reasoning inspired by swarm intelligence. Coordination in SwarmSys
emerges through iterative interactions among three specialized roles,
Explorers, Workers, and Validators, that continuously cycle through
exploration, exploitation, and validation. To enable scalable and adaptive
collaboration, we integrate adaptive agent and event profiles, embedding-based
probabilistic matching, and a pheromone-inspired reinforcement mechanism,
supporting dynamic task allocation and self-organizing convergence without
global supervision. Across symbolic reasoning, research synthesis, and
scientific programming tasks, SwarmSys consistently outperforms baselines,
improving both accuracy and reasoning stability. These findings highlight
swarm-inspired coordination as a promising paradigm for scalable, robust, and
adaptive multi-agent reasoning, suggesting that coordination scaling may rival
model scaling in advancing LLM intelligence.

Motivation: 从无标签的视听流中学习同步感知和可迁移的面部动态，解决现有方法在多种下游任务中的局限性。

Method: 结合掩码视觉建模与跨模态对比对齐，使用三个逐帧提示标记（身份、语音运动、环境运动）显式编码面部动态要素，通过对比学习实现音频-视觉流同步。

Result: 在四个任务家族（音频-视觉流同步、面部表情和头部动作识别、视觉语音识别、视觉配音）中均达到最先进结果。

Conclusion: 同步感知、分解的自监督预训练方法在多种需要不同能力的任务中表现出色，证明了该框架的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce SyncLipMAE, a self-supervised pretraining framework for
talking-face video that learns synchronization-aware and transferable facial
dynamics from unlabeled audio-visual streams. Our approach couples masked
visual modeling with cross-modal contrastive alignment and employs three
per-frame prompt tokens that explicitly encode the essential factors of a
talking-face frame - identity, vocal motion (speech-synchronized facial
dynamics), and ambient motion (audio-agnostic movements such as blinks and head
pose). The contrastive objective uses time-aligned vocal-motion and audio
tokens as positives and misaligned pairs as negatives, driving both modalities
into a shared embedding space and yielding token-level audio-visual stream
synchronization. After pretraining, the aligned audio tokens together with the
visual prompt tokens (identity, vocal motion, ambient motion) form a unified
interface for four disparate downstream settings: (i) audio-visual stream
synchronization; (ii) facial emotion and head/face action recognition; (iii)
visual speech recognition; and (iv) visual dubbing, for which we enable
indistinguishable audio- or video-driven control within a single model. Across
four task families that require distinct capabilities, SyncLipMAE achieves
state-of-the-art results, underscoring the effectiveness of
synchronization-aware, factorized self-supervised pretraining.

TL;DR: StepFly是一个端到端的故障排除指南自动化框架，通过三阶段工作流解决现有LLM解决方案在TSG质量、复杂控制流、数据密集型查询和执行并行化方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模IT系统中的故障管理依赖故障排除指南，但手动执行缓慢且易出错。现有LLM解决方案缺乏对TSG质量问题、复杂控制流解释、数据密集型查询处理和执行并行化的专门支持。

Method: 三阶段工作流：1) TSG Mentor工具辅助SRE改进TSG质量；2) 离线预处理使用LLM从非结构化TSG提取结构化执行DAG并创建专用查询准备插件；3) 在线执行使用DAG引导的调度器-执行器框架，支持并行执行独立步骤。

Result: 在真实TSG和事件上的评估显示，StepFly在GPT-4.1上达到约94%的成功率，优于基线方法，且时间和token消耗更少。对于可并行TSG，执行时间减少了32.9%到70.4%。

Conclusion: StepFly框架有效解决了TSG自动化中的关键挑战，显著提高了故障排除的效率和成功率，为大规模IT系统的自动化事件管理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Effective incident management in large-scale IT systems relies on
troubleshooting guides (TSGs), but their manual execution is slow and
error-prone. While recent advances in LLMs offer promise for automating
incident management tasks, existing LLM-based solutions lack specialized
support for several key challenges, including managing TSG quality issues,
interpreting complex control flow, handling data-intensive queries, and
exploiting execution parallelism. We first conducted an empirical study on 92
real-world TSGs, and, guided by our findings, we present StepFly, a novel
end-to-end agentic framework for troubleshooting guide automation. Our approach
features a three-stage workflow: the first stage provides a comprehensive guide
together with a tool, TSG Mentor, to assist SREs in improving TSG quality; the
second stage performs offline preprocessing using LLMs to extract structured
execution DAGs from unstructured TSGs and to create dedicated Query Preparation
Plugins (QPPs); and the third stage executes online using a DAG-guided
scheduler-executor framework with a memory system to guarantee correct workflow
and support parallel execution of independent steps. Our empirical evaluation
on a collection of real-world TSGs and incidents demonstrates that StepFly
achieves a ~94% success rate on GPT-4.1, outperforming baselines with less time
and token consumption. Furthermore, it achieves a remarkable execution time
reduction of 32.9% to 70.4% for parallelizable TSGs.

TL;DR: DixitWorld评估套件用于评估视觉语言模型的多模态溯因推理能力，包含动态多代理环境DixitArena和静态问答基准DixitBench，揭示了生成创造性和判别理解之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对视觉语言模型溯因推理能力的评估主要局限于静态单代理任务，需要更全面的评估框架来理解模型在多模态推理中的表现。

Method: 开发了DixitWorld评估套件，包含DixitArena（动态多代理环境，评估假设生成和选择）和DixitBench（静态QA基准，隔离听者任务）。

Result: 较小开源模型在创意讲故事方面表现更好，而较大专有模型在整体性能特别是听者角色上更优；DixitBench与DixitArena听者结果强相关。

Conclusion: 多模态溯因推理中存在生成创造性和判别理解之间的关键权衡，这是开发更平衡和有能力视觉语言代理的核心挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal abductive reasoning--the generation and selection of explanatory
hypotheses from partial observations--is a cornerstone of intelligence. Current
evaluations of this ability in vision-language models (VLMs) are largely
confined to static, single-agent tasks. Inspired by Dixit, we introduce
DixitWorld, a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to deconstruct this
challenge. DIXITWORLD features two core components: DixitArena, a dynamic,
multi-agent environment that evaluates both hypothesis generation (a
"storyteller" crafting cryptic clues) and hypothesis selection ("listeners"
choosing the target image from decoys) under imperfect information; and
DixitBench, a static QA benchmark that isolates the listener's task for
efficient, controlled evaluation. Results from DixitArena reveal distinct,
role-dependent behaviors: smaller open-source models often excel as creative
storytellers, producing imaginative yet less discriminative clues, whereas
larger proprietary models demonstrate superior overall performance,
particularly as listeners. Performance on DixitBench strongly correlates with
listener results in DixitArena, validating it as a reliable proxy for
hypothesis selection. Our findings reveal a key trade-off between generative
creativity and discriminative understanding in multimodal abductive reasoning,
a central challenge for developing more balanced and capable vision-language
agents.

TL;DR: CharCom是一个模块化、参数高效的框架，通过可组合的LoRA适配器实现角色一致的故事插图生成，无需重新训练基础模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保角色身份在不同提示下的一致性是基于扩散的文本到图像生成的基本限制。

Method: 在冻结的扩散骨干网络上构建，使用提示感知控制动态组合适配器进行推理，实现高效的角色定制。

Result: 在多场景叙事实验中，CharCom显著提高了角色保真度、语义对齐和时间连贯性，在拥挤场景中保持鲁棒性，并能以最小开销实现可扩展的多角色生成。

Conclusion: CharCom适用于故事插图和动画等实际应用场景。

Abstract: Ensuring character identity consistency across varying prompts remains a
fundamental limitation in diffusion-based text-to-image generation. We propose
CharCom, a modular and parameter-efficient framework that achieves
character-consistent story illustration through composable LoRA adapters,
enabling efficient per-character customization without retraining the base
model. Built on a frozen diffusion backbone, CharCom dynamically composes
adapters at inference using prompt-aware control. Experiments on multi-scene
narratives demonstrate that CharCom significantly enhances character fidelity,
semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. It remains robust in crowded scenes
and enables scalable multi-character generation with minimal overhead, making
it well-suited for real-world applications such as story illustration and
animation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PALU是一种性能感知长度更新算法，通过约束优化方法减少大语言模型的推理步骤长度，在保持性能的同时实现简洁推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有简洁推理方法依赖人工设计的启发式规则，难以平衡简洁性和性能，且无法跨领域和模型规模适应。

Method: 将简洁推理建模为约束优化问题，使用拉格朗日优化转化为无约束问题，并通过三个近似简化更新规则：离策略性能估计、拉格朗日乘子截断、分位数驱动的长度调整。

Result: 在DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B上，PALU将输出长度减少65%，准确率提升15%，在五个基准测试中优于其他方法，并能跨领域和模型规模适应。

Conclusion: PALU是一种实用有效的简洁推理方法，能够在大幅减少推理步骤的同时提升模型性能。

Abstract: Concise reasoning in large language models seeks to generate only essential
intermediate steps needed to arrive at a final answer, thereby alleviating
issues of overthinking. Most proposed approaches hinge on carefully
hand-crafted heuristics, struggling to balance concision with performance,
often failing to adapt across domains and model scales. In this work, we
address these challenges by introducing a principled and pragmatic strategy,
performance-aware length updating (PALU). As a principled algorithm, PALU
formulates concise reasoning as a constrained optimization problem, minimizing
response length subject to a performance constraint, and then applies
Lagrangian optimization to convert it into a tractable unconstrained problem.
As a pragmatic solution, PALU streamlines complicated update rules through
three approximations: (i) estimating performance with off-policy rollouts, (ii)
truncating the Lagrange multiplier to two extremes, and (iii) replacing
gradient-based updates with quantile-driven length adjustments. PALU reduces
output length by 65% while improving accuracy by 15% when applied to
DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, averaged over five benchmarks, outperforming a
range of alternative methods. Furthermore, PALU is demonstrated to adapt across
both domain (logic, STEM and math) and model scale (1.5B, 7B, 14B) entrenching
the algorithm as a practical and effective concise reasoning approach.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAFER是一个两阶段风险控制框架，用于在开放域问答中确保大语言模型输出的可信度，通过弃权感知采样和保形化过滤来提供统计保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有选择性保形预测方法不适用于开放域问答场景，因为它们假设所有实例的可接受答案都能通过有限采样获得，而实际上开放域问答缺乏固定有限的解空间。

Method: SAFER框架包含两个阶段：1) 在保留校准集上使用Clopper-Pearson精确方法校准采样预算；2) 应用保形风险控制方法确定统计有效的置信度阈值，过滤不可靠的候选答案。

Result: SAFER能够控制采样集错误覆盖率和正确答案被排除的风险，兼容各种任务特定的准入标准和校准-测试分割比例。

Conclusion: SAFER提供了一个稳健且数据高效的风险控制框架，适用于开放域问答场景，确保大语言模型输出的可信度。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in risk-sensitive
applications such as real-world open-ended question answering (QA), ensuring
the trustworthiness of their outputs has become critical. Existing selective
conformal prediction (SCP) methods provide statistical guarantees by
constructing prediction sets with a constrained miscoverage rate for correct
answers. However, prior works unrealistically assume that admissible answers
for all instances can be obtained via finite sampling, even for open-ended QA
scenarios that lack a fixed and finite solution space. To address this, we
introduce a two-stage risk control framework comprising abstention-aware
sampling and conformalized filtering (SAFER). Firstly, on a held-out
calibration set, SAFER calibrates a sampling budget within the maximum sampling
cap, using the Clopper-Pearson exact method at a user-desired risk level (i.e.,
the maximum allowable miscoverage rate of the sampling sets). If the risk level
cannot be satisfied within the cap, we abstain; otherwise, the calibrated
sampling budget becomes the minimum requirements at test time. Then, we employ
calibration instances where correct answers are attainable under the calibrated
budget and apply the conformal risk control method to determine a statistically
valid uncertainty threshold, which filters unreliable distractors from the
candidate set for each test data point. In this stage, SAFER introduces an
additional risk level to guide the calculation of the threshold, thereby
controlling the risk of correct answers being excluded. Furthermore, we show
that SAFER is compatible with various task-specific admission criteria and
calibration-test split ratios, highlighting its robustness and high data
efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出Environment Tuning训练范式，让LLM智能体直接从问题实例中学习复杂行为，无需专家轨迹数据，解决了SFT过拟合和RL冷启动问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体在复杂多轮工具使用任务中前景广阔，但高质量训练数据极度稀缺。SFT在合成数据上会导致过拟合，而标准RL存在冷启动问题和训练不稳定性

Method: Environment Tuning通过结构化课程、可操作的环境增强提供纠正反馈、细粒度进度奖励来确保稳定高效探索，直接从问题实例学习

Result: 仅使用BFCL基准的400个问题实例，不仅实现了与强基线相当的分布内性能，还表现出优越的分布外泛化能力，克服了SFT方法的性能崩溃问题

Conclusion: 该工作实现了从静态轨迹监督微调到动态环境探索的范式转变，为训练更鲁棒和数据高效的智能体开辟了新途径

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents show great promise for complex, multi-turn
tool-use tasks, but their development is often hampered by the extreme scarcity
of high-quality training data. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic data
leads to overfitting, whereas standard reinforcement learning (RL) struggles
with a critical cold-start problem and training instability. To address these
challenges, we introduce $\textbf{Environment Tuning}$, a novel training
paradigm that enables agents to learn complex behaviors directly from problem
instances without relying on pre-collected expert trajectories.
$\textbf{Environment Tuning}$ orchestrates this learning process through a
structured curriculum, actionable environment augmentation that provides
corrective feedback, and fine-grained progress rewards to ensure stable and
efficient exploration. Using only 400 problem instances from Berkeley
Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) benchmark, our method not only achieves
competitive in-distribution performance against strong baselines but also
demonstrates superior out-of-distribution generalization, overcoming the
performance collapse common to SFT-based approaches. Our work presents a
paradigm shift from supervised fine-tuning on static trajectories to dynamic,
environment-based exploration, paving the way for training more robust and
data-efficient agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有激活引导方法依赖粗略启发式，缺乏对引导位置和干预强度的原则性考量，需要更可靠的行为控制方法来确保LLM的可信生成。

Method: 从双视图（尾平均和结束标记）学习属性对齐子空间，通过约束几何目标选择干预强度，进行样本级正交残差校准，并使用轻量级位置扫描识别可注入位置。

Result: 在不同模型和评估范式下，PIXEL持续改进属性对齐，同时保持模型的通用能力。

Conclusion: PIXEL为LLM的可控生成提供了一种实用且原则性的方法，具有表示级的最小干预保证。

Abstract: Reliable behavior control is central to deploying large language models
(LLMs) on the web. Activation steering offers a tuning-free route to align
attributes (e.g., truthfulness) that ensure trustworthy generation. Prevailing
approaches rely on coarse heuristics and lack a principled account of where to
steer and how strongly to intervene. To this end, we propose Position-wise
Injection with eXact Estimated Levels (PIXEL), a position-wise activation
steering framework that, in contrast to prior work, learns a property-aligned
subspace from dual views (tail-averaged and end-token) and selects intervention
strength via a constrained geometric objective with a closed-form solution,
thereby adapting to token-level sensitivity without global hyperparameter
tuning. PIXEL further performs sample-level orthogonal residual calibration to
refine the global attribute direction and employs a lightweight
position-scanning routine to identify receptive injection sites. We
additionally provide representation-level guarantees for the
minimal-intervention rule, supporting reliable alignment. Across diverse models
and evaluation paradigms, PIXEL consistently improves attribute alignment while
preserving model general capabilities, offering a practical and principled
method for LLMs' controllable generation. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出自适应双推理器(ADR)，通过快速思维和慢速思维两种推理模式的动态切换，在保持推理性能的同时显著降低计算成本和推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长推理模型在推理过程中存在过度思考问题，导致计算成本增加和推理延迟升高，需要平衡推理性能与效率。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：1) 冷启动阶段通过监督微调构建混合推理数据集；2) 强化学习阶段引入熵引导混合策略优化(EHPO)，在高熵单元进行分支并使用难度感知惩罚来平衡快慢推理。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，ADR在保持最先进方法性能的同时，推理输出长度减少49.5%至59.3%，性能提升最高达6.1%。

Conclusion: ADR通过自适应双推理机制有效解决了长推理模型的过度思考问题，实现了推理性能与效率的良好平衡。

Abstract: Although Long Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved superior performance on
various reasoning scenarios, they often suffer from increased computational
costs and inference latency caused by overthinking. To address these
limitations, we propose Adaptive Dual Reasoner, which supports two reasoning
modes: fast thinking and slow thinking. ADR dynamically alternates between
these modes based on the contextual complexity during reasoning. ADR is trained
in two stages: (1) A cold-start stage using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to
equip the model with the ability to integrate both fast and slow reasoning
modes, in which we construct a hybrid reasoning dataset through a dedicated
pipeline to provide large-scale supervision. (2) A reinforcement learning stage
for optimizing reasoning effort, where we introduce Entropy-guided Hybrid
Policy Optimization EHPO, an RL training framework employing an entropy-guided
dynamic rollout strategy for branching at high-entropy units and a
difficulty-aware penalty to balance fast and slow reasoning. Across challenging
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ADR achieves an effective balance between
reasoning performance and efficiency among state-of-the-art approaches.
Specifically, ADR yields a performance gain of up to 6.1%, while reducing the
reasoning output length by 49.5% to 59.3%.

Method: 提出基于扰动的关键神经元因果识别方法，系统定位LLMs中的关键神经元。

Result: 发现：(1)LLMs存在超稀疏关键神经元，破坏72B参数模型的关键神经元可使困惑度增加20个数量级；(2)关键神经元集中在外层MLP组件；(3)性能退化呈现急剧相变而非渐进下降。

Conclusion: 这些发现为开发更鲁棒的模型架构和提高安全关键应用中的部署安全性提供指导。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational tools in natural
language processing, powering a wide range of applications and research. Many
studies have shown that LLMs share significant similarities with the human
brain. Recent neuroscience research has found that a small subset of biological
neurons in the human brain are crucial for core cognitive functions, which
raises a fundamental question: do LLMs also contain a small subset of critical
neurons? In this paper, we investigate this question by proposing a
Perturbation-based Causal Identification of Critical Neurons method to
systematically locate such critical neurons in LLMs. Our findings reveal three
key insights: (1) LLMs contain ultra-sparse critical neuron sets. Disrupting
these critical neurons can cause a 72B-parameter model with over 1.1 billion
neurons to completely collapse, with perplexity increasing by up to 20 orders
of magnitude; (2) These critical neurons are not uniformly distributed, but
tend to concentrate in the outer layers, particularly within the MLP down\_proj
components; (3) Performance degradation exhibits sharp phase transitions,
rather than a gradual decline, when these critical neurons are disrupted.
Through comprehensive experiments across diverse model architectures and
scales, we provide deeper analysis of these phenomena and their implications
for LLM robustness and interpretability. These findings can offer guidance for
developing more robust model architectures and improving deployment security in
safety-critical applications.

Conclusion: 该方法完全模型无关，显著提升了现有多模态大推理模型的可靠性和可解释性，使其能够在高风险应用中安全部署。

Abstract: Multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) are rapidly advancing
vision-language reasoning and are emerging as a foundation for cross-modal
intelligence. Hallucination remains a persistent failure mode, manifesting
itself as erroneous reasoning chains and misinterpretation of visual content.
In this study, we observe that attention heads exhibit a staged division:
shallow heads predominantly serve perception, while deeper heads shift toward
symbolic reasoning, revealing two major causes of hallucination, namely
perceptual bias and reasoning drift. To address these issues, we propose a
lightweight and interpretable two-step plugin, Functional Head Identification
and Class-conditioned Rescaling, which locates perception- and
reasoning-oriented heads and regulates their contributions without retraining.
Evaluations on three real-world MLRMs (Kimi-VL, Ocean-R1, R1-Onevision), six
benchmarks across three domains, and four baselines show that our plugin
achieves an average improvement of 5% and up to 15%, with only <1% additional
computation and 9% of baseline latency. Our approach is completely
model-agnostic and significantly enhances both the reliability and
interpretability of the off-the-shelf MLRMs, thereby enabling their safe
deployment in high-stakes applications. Our code is available at

Abstract: While ethical arguments for fairness in healthcare AI are well-established,
the economic and strategic value of inclusive design remains underexplored.
This perspective introduces the ``inclusive innovation dividend'' -- the
counterintuitive principle that solutions engineered for diverse, constrained
use cases generate superior economic returns in broader markets. Drawing from
assistive technologies that evolved into billion-dollar mainstream industries,
we demonstrate how inclusive healthcare AI development creates business value
beyond compliance requirements. We identify four mechanisms through which
inclusive innovation drives returns: (1) market expansion via geographic
scalability and trust acceleration; (2) risk mitigation through reduced
remediation costs and litigation exposure; (3) performance dividends from
superior generalization and reduced technical debt, and (4) competitive
advantages in talent acquisition and clinical adoption. We present the
Healthcare AI Inclusive Innovation Framework (HAIIF), a practical scoring
system that enables organizations to evaluate AI investments based on their
potential to capture these benefits. HAIIF provides structured guidance for
resource allocation, transforming fairness and inclusivity from regulatory
checkboxes into sources of strategic differentiation. Our findings suggest that
organizations investing incrementally in inclusive design can achieve expanded
market reach and sustained competitive advantages, while those treating these
considerations as overhead face compounding disadvantages as network effects
and data advantages accrue to early movers.

Conclusion: 推理后训练增强了超越口头表达的不确定性量化能力，轨迹长度是大型推理模型的实用置信度度量。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification for LLMs is a key research direction towards
addressing hallucination and other issues that limit their reliable deployment.
In this work, we show that reasoning trace length is a simple and useful
confidence estimator in large reasoning models. Through comprehensive
experiments across multiple models, datasets, and prompts, we show that trace
length performs in comparable but complementary ways to other zero-shot
confidence estimators such as verbalized confidence. Our work reveals that
reasoning post-training fundamentally alters the relationship between trace
length and accuracy, going beyond prior work that had shown that post-training
causes traces to grow longer in general (e.g., "overthinking"). We investigate
the mechanisms behind trace length's performance as a confidence signal,
observing that the effect remains even after adjusting for confounders such as
problem difficulty and GRPO-induced length bias. We identify high-entropy or
"forking" tokens as playing a key role in the mechanism. Our findings
demonstrate that reasoning post-training enhances uncertainty quantification
beyond verbal expressions, and establish trace length as a practical confidence
measure for large reasoning models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a generalizable approach for modeling

health records (EHR) data in temporal reasoning. To address these challenges,
we introduce Traj-CoA, a multi-agent system involving chain-of-agents for
patient trajectory modeling. Traj-CoA employs a chain of worker agents to
process EHR data in manageable chunks sequentially, distilling critical events
into a shared long-term memory module, EHRMem, to reduce noise and preserve a
comprehensive timeline. A final manager agent synthesizes the worker agents'
summary and the extracted timeline in EHRMem to make predictions. In a
zero-shot one-year lung cancer risk prediction task based on five-year EHR
data, Traj-CoA outperforms baselines of four categories. Analysis reveals that
Traj-CoA exhibits clinically aligned temporal reasoning, establishing it as a
promisingly robust and generalizable approach for modeling complex patient

Abstract: Autonomous agents utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in isolated medical tasks like diagnosis and image
analysis, but struggle with integrated clinical workflows that connect
diagnostic reasoning and medication decisions. We identify a core limitation:
existing medical AI systems process tasks in isolation without the
cross-validation and knowledge integration found in clinical teams, reducing
their effectiveness in real-world healthcare scenarios. To transform the
isolation paradigm into a collaborative approach, we propose MedCoAct, a
confidence-aware multi-agent framework that simulates clinical collaboration by
integrating specialized doctor and pharmacist agents, and present a benchmark,
DrugCareQA, to evaluate medical AI capabilities in integrated diagnosis and
treatment workflows. Our results demonstrate that MedCoAct achieves 67.58\%
diagnostic accuracy and 67.58\% medication recommendation accuracy,
outperforming single agent framework by 7.04\% and 7.08\% respectively. This

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Latent-Trajectory信号来预测推理过程的成功率，通过分析模型内部表征的时间演化来指导答案选择，显著减少计算浪费并提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理模型通过增加计算资源来提升问题解决能力，但如何可靠预测哪些推理路径会成功是关键挑战，避免计算浪费并提高整体效率。

Method: 引入Latent-Trajectory信号，通过测量推理过程中内部表征的整体变化、中间步骤累积变化以及向最终状态推进的程度来预测解决方案准确性。

Result: Latent-Trajectory信号比跨层指标和基于输出的置信度测量更可靠地预测准确性，在指导多代采样答案选择时，比多数投票更有效，减少70%令牌使用同时平均提高2.6%准确率。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅提供了推理时效率的实用策略，还从可解释性角度深入理解了推理过程在潜在空间中的表示和区分方式。

Abstract: Reasoning models improve their problem-solving ability through inference-time
scaling, allocating more compute via longer token budgets. Identifying which
reasoning traces are likely to succeed remains a key opportunity: reliably
predicting productive paths can substantially reduce wasted computation and
improve overall efficiency. We introduce Latent-Trajectory signals that
characterize the temporal evolution of a model's internal representations
during the generation of intermediate reasoning tokens. By measuring the
overall change in latent representations between the start and end of
reasoning, the change accumulated across intermediate steps, and the extent to
which these changes advance toward the final state, we show that these signals
predict solution accuracy more reliably than both cross-layer metrics and
output-based confidence measures. When used to guide answer selection across
multiple sampled generations, Latent-Trajectory signals make test-time scaling
more effective and efficient than majority voting, reducing token usage by up
to 70% while preserving and even improving accuracy by 2.6% on average.
Moreover, these predictive signals often emerge early in the reasoning trace,
enabling early selection and allocation of compute to the most promising
candidates. Our findings contribute not only practical strategies for
inference-time efficiency, but also a deeper interpretability perspective on
how reasoning processes are represented and differentiated in latent space.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ELAIPBench是一个由领域专家构建的基准测试，用于评估大语言模型对AI研究论文的理解能力，包含403个多选题，结果显示当前最佳LLM准确率仅为39.95%，远低于人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估LLM对学术论文的深度理解能力方面存在不足，问题设计表面化或评估指标不可靠，需要开发更有效的评估工具。

Method: 通过激励驱动的对抗性标注过程，从137篇论文中构建了403个多选题，涵盖三个难度级别，强调非平凡推理而非浅层检索。

Result: 实验表明最佳LLM准确率仅为39.95%，前沿LLM即使配备思维模式或RAG系统也无法改善结果，甚至因过度思考或噪声检索而降低准确率。

Conclusion: 当前LLM能力与真正理解学术论文之间存在显著差距，需要进一步研究来提升模型的深度理解能力。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel at many domain-specific tasks, their
ability to deeply comprehend and reason about full-length academic papers
remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks often fall short of capturing such
depth, either due to surface-level question design or unreliable evaluation
metrics. To address this gap, we introduce ELAIPBench, a benchmark curated by
domain experts to evaluate LLMs' comprehension of artificial intelligence (AI)
research papers. Developed through an incentive-driven, adversarial annotation
process, ELAIPBench features 403 multiple-choice questions from 137 papers. It
spans three difficulty levels and emphasizes non-trivial reasoning rather than
shallow retrieval. Our experiments show that the best-performing LLM achieves
an accuracy of only 39.95%, far below human performance. Moreover, we observe
that frontier LLMs equipped with a thinking mode or a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) system fail to improve final results-even harming accuracy due
to overthinking or noisy retrieval. These findings underscore the significant
gap between current LLM capabilities and genuine comprehension of academic
papers.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的直觉-方法分层模型与范围扩展框架，通过整合直觉思维、方法思维和范围扩展来系统性地解决LLM未见问题，并引入方法扩展熵作为定量评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究已引入基于方法的推理和范围扩展来提升LLM性能，但缺乏系统整合。本文旨在将这些思想统一到一个框架中，更系统地解决间接（未见）问题。

Method: 构建直觉-方法分层模型：直觉思维提供快速初步答案，方法思维将问题与解决方案解耦为可转移的推理单元。范围扩展包括垂直（原因分析）、水平（平行和泛化问题）以及首次提出的时间和空间扩展，形成系统化的知识树网络。

Result: 通过逻辑连接现有方法与新扩展，并引入基于熵的评估框架，该方法增强了LLM在现实问题解决中的适应性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过统一的推理框架和定量评估指标，朝着为LLM构建更稳健和可扩展的推理范式迈进，提升了解决未见问题的能力。

Abstract: Existing studies have introduced method-based reasoning and scope extension
as approaches to enhance Large Language Model (LLM) performance beyond direct
matrix mappings. Building on these foundations, this paper summarizes and
integrates these ideas into a unified Intuition-Method Layered Model with Scope
Extension, designed to address indirected (unseen) issues more systematically.
In this framework, intuition-based thinking provides rapid first-reaction
answers, while method-based thinking decouples questions and solutions into
transferable reasoning units. Scope extension is then applied to broaden
applicability, including vertical (cause analysis), horizontal (parallel and
generalized issues), and for the first time, temporal and spatial extensions,
which expand reasoning across time and contextual dimensions. These extensions
are organized into systematic knowledge trees that interconnect into a
knowledge network, thereby increasing adaptability. To quantitatively evaluate
this process, we propose the entropy of method extension, which measures the
independence and diversity of extensions as an indicator of the system's
capacity to solve unseen questions. By logically connecting existing approaches
with new extensions and introducing an entropy-based evaluation framework, this
work advances toward a more robust and extensible reasoning paradigm for LLMs
in real-world problem-solving.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文从随机有限集和可转移信念模型两个角度深入分析随机置换集之间的距离，提出基于累积Jaccard指数的距离度量方法，具有自然的重顶性特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机置换集是表示有序结构不确定信息的新框架，测量置换质量函数之间的距离是RPS理论中的关键研究课题。

Method: 采用RPS的层-2信念结构解释，将其视为TBM的细化，引入累积Jaccard指数量化两个置换间的相似性，并基于累积Jaccard指数矩阵提出RPS距离度量方法。

Result: 提出的方法克服了现有方法的缺点，与Jousselme距离兼容，具有更高的敏感性和灵活性，且具有自然的重顶性特性。

Conclusion: 基于累积Jaccard指数的距离度量方法为RPS理论提供了一种有效的距离测量工具，具有理论合理性和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Random permutation set (RPS) is a recently proposed framework designed to
represent order-structured uncertain information. Measuring the distance
between permutation mass functions is a key research topic in RPS theory
(RPST). This paper conducts an in-depth analysis of distances between RPSs from
two different perspectives: random finite set (RFS) and transferable belief
model (TBM). Adopting the layer-2 belief structure interpretation of RPS, we
regard RPST as a refinement of TBM, where the order in the ordered focus set
represents qualitative propensity. Starting from the permutation, we introduce
a new definition of the cumulative Jaccard index to quantify the similarity
between two permutations and further propose a distance measure method for RPSs
based on the cumulative Jaccard index matrix. The metric and structural
properties of the proposed distance measure are investigated, including the
positive definiteness analysis of the cumulative Jaccard index matrix, and a
correction scheme is provided. The proposed method has a natural
top-weightiness property: inconsistencies between higher-ranked elements tend
to result in greater distance values. Two parameters are provided to the
decision-maker to adjust the weight and truncation depth. Several numerical
examples are used to compare the proposed method with the existing method. The
experimental results show that the proposed method not only overcomes the
shortcomings of the existing method and is compatible with the Jousselme
distance, but also has higher sensitivity and flexibility.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出使用进化算法优化大语言模型的方法EA4LLM，首次成功训练了10亿参数的大语言模型，挑战了基于梯度优化是训练神经网络唯一可行方法的普遍假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于梯度优化方法对硬件要求严格、需要高并发高内存GPU，且要求所有神经网络操作可微分的问题，使许多有前景的不可微分架构能够实际应用。

Method: 使用进化算法优化大语言模型，开发了EA4LLM方法，从预训练阶段开始成功训练10亿参数模型。

Result: 通过大量实验验证了进化算法有效优化神经网络的能力，提供了关键见解。

Conclusion: 该方法有显著潜力降低大语言模型训练的计算成本，使计算资源有限的群体能够参与深度学习研究。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress,
with model optimization primarily relying on gradient-based optimizers such as
Adam. However, these gradient-based methods impose stringent hardware
requirements, demanding high-concurrency, high-memory GPUs. Moreover, they
require all neural network operations to be differentiable, thereby excluding
many promising non-differentiable architectures from practical use. To address
these limitations, we propose a method for optimizing LLMs using evolutionary
algorithms (EA4LLM) and, for the first time, successfully demonstrate its
capability to train a 1-billion-parameter LLM from the pre-trained stage. We
conduct extensive experiments and provide key insights into how evolutionary
algorithms can effectively optimize neural networks. Our work challenges the
prevailing assumption that gradient-based optimization is the only viable
approach for training neural networks. It also holds significant potential to
reduce the computational cost of training large language models, thereby
enabling groups with limited computational resources to participate in deep
learning research.

TL;DR: 提出多智能体强化学习框架，协调领域专业智能体进行文本到图像生成，通过复合奖励函数平衡语义相似性和视觉质量，显著提升生成内容丰富度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态文本到图像生成中语义对齐和专业细节保持的困难，特别是在多样化视觉领域中。

Method: 使用多智能体强化学习框架，包含文本增强和图像生成两个耦合子系统，采用PPO训练，结合对比学习、双向注意力和迭代反馈机制。

Result: 在六个实验设置中，生成内容显著丰富（词数增加1614%），ROUGE-1分数降低69.7%，Transformer融合方法获得最高综合得分0.521。

Conclusion: 协作式、专业化驱动的架构在推进可靠多模态生成系统方面具有前景，但跨模态语义基础仍存在挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal text-to-image generation remains constrained by the difficulty of
maintaining semantic alignment and professional-level detail across diverse
visual domains. We propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that
coordinates domain-specialized agents (e.g., focused on architecture,
portraiture, and landscape imagery) within two coupled subsystems: a text
enhancement module and an image generation module, each augmented with
multimodal integration components. Agents are trained using Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) under a composite reward function that balances semantic
similarity, linguistic visual quality, and content diversity. Cross-modal
alignment is enforced through contrastive learning, bidirectional attention,
and iterative feedback between text and image. Across six experimental
settings, our system significantly enriches generated content (word count
increased by 1614%) while reducing ROUGE-1 scores by 69.7%. Among fusion
methods, Transformer-based strategies achieve the highest composite score
(0.521), despite occasional stability issues. Multimodal ensembles yield
moderate consistency (ranging from 0.444 to 0.481), reflecting the persistent
challenges of cross-modal semantic grounding. These findings underscore the
promise of collaborative, specialization-driven architectures for advancing
reliable multimodal generative systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管学生满意度已被广泛研究，但可解释机器学习和神经网络等现代技术尚未充分探索。本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用结合提升方法和可解释性的自动分段线性回归(APLR)模型，并与多种最先进方法进行比较。

Result: APLR模型提供了最佳拟合效果，通过数值和可视化解释识别出时间管理、专注力、帮助同学和线下课程参与度是最重要的积极影响因素，而创意活动参与度无正面影响。

Conclusion: APLR模型不仅能准确预测学习满意度，还能提供个体层面的因素解释，使教育者能够根据学生特征定制教学方案。

Abstract: Although student learning satisfaction has been widely studied, modern
techniques such as interpretable machine learning and neural networks have not
been sufficiently explored. This study demonstrates that a recent model that
combines boosting with interpretability, automatic piecewise linear
regression(APLR), offers the best fit for predicting learning satisfaction
among several state-of-the-art approaches. Through the analysis of APLR's
numerical and visual interpretations, students' time management and
concentration abilities, perceived helpfulness to classmates, and participation
in offline courses have the most significant positive impact on learning
satisfaction. Surprisingly, involvement in creative activities did not
positively affect learning satisfaction. Moreover, the contributing factors can
be interpreted on an individual level, allowing educators to customize
instructions according to student profiles.

Motivation: 现有方法存在两类问题：强化学习方法数据效率低、对现实动态建模过于简化、难以实施操作约束；分解在线优化方法依赖人工设计的高层目标，缺乏对底层路由动态的认知。需要一种能结合两者优势的新方法。

Method: 提出训练免费的混合层次框架，将LLM作为元优化器生成语义启发式，指导负责约束实施和实时决策执行的底层优化器。通过和声搜索驱动的闭环进化过程，基于优化层的可行性和性能反馈迭代调整LLM提示。

Conclusion: 该混合框架成功解决了在线叫车平台供需平衡问题，通过LLM与数学优化的结合，克服了现有方法的局限性，实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Online ride-hailing platforms aim to deliver efficient mobility-on-demand
services, often facing challenges in balancing dynamic and spatially
heterogeneous supply and demand. Existing methods typically fall into two
categories: reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, which suffer from data
inefficiency, oversimplified modeling of real-world dynamics, and difficulty
enforcing operational constraints; or decomposed online optimization methods,
which rely on manually designed high-level objectives that lack awareness of
low-level routing dynamics. To address this issue, we propose a novel hybrid
framework that integrates large language model (LLM) with mathematical
optimization in a dynamic hierarchical system: (1) it is training-free,
removing the need for large-scale interaction data as in RL, and (2) it
leverages LLM to bridge cognitive limitations caused by problem decomposition
by adaptively generating high-level objectives. Within this framework, LLM
serves as a meta-optimizer, producing semantic heuristics that guide a
low-level optimizer responsible for constraint enforcement and real-time
decision execution. These heuristics are refined through a closed-loop
evolutionary process, driven by harmony search, which iteratively adapts the
LLM prompts based on feasibility and performance feedback from the optimization
layer. Extensive experiments based on scenarios derived from both the New York
and Chicago taxi datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
achieving an average improvement of 16% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了UCAS方法，通过利用模型内部不确定性信号来改进信用分配，解决了RLVR中粗粒度优势信号导致的探索效率低下和熵崩溃问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RLVR算法（如GRPO）对所有token广播统一优势信号，忽略了推理过程中不确定的高风险决策的关键作用，导致探索效率低下和熵崩溃问题。

Method: UCAS是一个无模型方法，通过两阶段机制：首先使用模型的整体自信度调节响应级优势，然后基于原始logit确定性应用token级惩罚，鼓励对产生正确答案的高不确定性路径进行探索，同时惩罚过度自信但错误的推理。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准测试上的广泛实验表明，UCAS在多个模型规模（包括1.5B和7B）上显著优于强RLVR基线，不仅获得更高奖励，还促进更大的推理多样性并成功缓解熵崩溃。

Conclusion: UCAS通过细粒度的不确定性感知优势塑造，有效平衡了探索与利用的权衡，显著提升了LLMs在强化学习中的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has shown significant
promise for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). However, prevailing algorithms like GRPO broadcast a uniform advantage
signal across all tokens in a sequence. This coarse-grained approach overlooks
the pivotal role of uncertain, high-stakes decisions during reasoning, leading
to inefficient exploration and the well-documented problem of entropy collapse.
To address this, we introduce UnCertainty-aware Advantage Shaping (UCAS), a
model-free method that refines credit assignment by leveraging the model's
internal uncertainty signals. UCAS operates in two stages: it first modulates
the response-level advantage using the model's overall self-confidence, and
then applies a token-level penalty based on raw logit certainty. This dual
mechanism encourages exploration of high-uncertainty paths that yield correct
answers while penalizing overconfident yet erroneous reasoning, effectively
balancing the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Extensive experiments on five
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that UCAS significantly outperforms
strong RLVR baselines across multiple model scales, including 1.5B and 7B. Our
analysis confirms that UCAS not only achieves higher rewards but also promotes
greater reasoning diversity and successfully mitigates entropy collapse.

Abstract: Generative Agentic AI systems are emerging as a powerful paradigm for
automating complex, multi-step tasks. However, many existing frameworks for
building these systems introduce significant complexity, a steep learning
curve, and substantial boilerplate code, hindering rapid prototyping and
deployment. This paper introduces simpliflow, a lightweight, open-source Python
framework designed to address these challenges. simpliflow enables the rapid
development and orchestration of linear, deterministic agentic workflows
through a declarative, JSON-based configuration. Its modular architecture
decouples agent management, workflow execution, and post-processing, promoting
ease of use and extensibility. By integrating with LiteLLM, it supports over
100 Large Language Models (LLMs) out-of-the-box. We present the architecture,
operational flow, and core features of simpliflow, demonstrating its utility
through diverse use cases ranging from software development simulation to
real-time system interaction. A comparative analysis with prominent frameworks
like LangChain and AutoGen highlights simpliflow's unique position as a tool
optimized for simplicity, control, and speed in deterministic workflow
environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
substantial potential in video understanding. However, existing benchmarks fail
to comprehensively evaluate synergistic reasoning capabilities across audio and
visual modalities, often neglecting either one of the modalities or integrating
them in a logically inconsistent manner. To bridge this gap, we introduce
OmniVideoBench, a large-scale and rigorously designed benchmark dedicated to
assessing synergistic audio-visual understanding, with a strong emphasis on
modality complementarity and logical consistency. Specifically, OmniVideoBench
comprises 1000 high-quality question-answer(QA) pairs, each annotated with
step-by-step reasoning traces, derived from 628 diverse videos ranging from
several seconds to 30 minutes, and manually verified to guarantee complete
correctness and uniqueness. Moreover, OmniVideoBench encompasses 13 carefully
designed question types, covering temporal reasoning, spatial localization,
counting, causal inference, summarization, and beyond, thereby capturing the
essential challenges of video understanding. Evaluation of multiple MLLMs on
OmniVideoBench reveals a pronounced gap between model performance and human
reasoning, with open-source models lagging significantly behind their
closed-source counterparts, underscoring the inherent difficulty of genuine
audio-visual reasoning. We will release OmniVideoBench to foster the
development of MLLMs with stronger and more generalizable reasoning
capabilities.

Conclusion: ETM通过连接理论抽象和操作实现，将矛盾分离范式推进为通用、可扩展且具有实际竞争力的自动推理模型，为逻辑推理和定理证明的未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Automated deduction lies at the core of Artificial Intelligence (AI),
underpinning theorem proving, formal verification, and logical reasoning.
Despite decades of progress, reconciling deductive completeness with
computational efficiency remains an enduring challenge. Traditional reasoning
calculi, grounded in binary resolution, restrict inference to pairwise clause
interactions and thereby limit deductive synergy among multiple clauses. The
Contradiction Separation Extension (CSE) framework, introduced in 2018,
proposed a dynamic multi-clause reasoning theory that redefined logical
inference as a process of contradiction separation rather than sequential
resolution. While that work established the theoretical foundation, its
algorithmic realization remained unformalized and unpublished. This work
presents the Extended Triangular Method (ETM), a generalized
contradiction-construction algorithm that formalizes and extends the internal
mechanisms of contradiction separation. The ETM unifies multiple
contradiction-building strategies, including the earlier Standard Extension
method, within a triangular geometric framework that supports flexible clause
interaction and dynamic synergy. ETM serves as the algorithmic core of several
high-performance theorem provers, CSE, CSE-E, CSI-E, and CSI-Enig, whose
competitive results in standard first-order benchmarks (TPTP problem sets and
CASC 2018-2015) empirically validate the effectiveness and generality of the
proposed approach. By bridging theoretical abstraction and operational
implementation, ETM advances the contradiction separation paradigm into a
generalized, scalable, and practically competitive model for automated
reasoning, offering new directions for future research in logical inference and
theorem proving.

Motivation: 现有方法在将自然语言问题翻译成符号语言时，只关注语义相似性，而忽略了选择目标符号语言类型本身的重要性。不同的逻辑推理问题对应不同的最优符号语言形式化方法。

Method: 利用LLMs为每个问题自适应选择最合适的符号语言（一阶逻辑、逻辑编程或布尔可满足性），然后将自然语言问题翻译成目标符号语言表达式，并使用相应的逻辑求解器得出最终答案。

Result: 在基准测试中，自适应选择方法显著优于将所有问题翻译成单一符号语言或随机选择符号语言的方法。在混合数据集上达到96%的准确率，比一阶逻辑翻译的次高准确率提升了25%。

Conclusion: 不同自然语言逻辑推理问题对应不同的最优符号语言形式化方法，自适应选择目标符号语言能够显著提升LLMs的逻辑推理性能。

problems into a symbolic language (SL). Though numerous works focusing on
improving this translation accuracy, they only consider the similarity between
the meaning of SL and NL, overlooking another crucial influencing factor, the
selection of the target SL type itself. For example, first-order logic language
specializes in logical reasoning with categorical syllogisms and complex
quantifiers, while Boolean satisfiability formalism excels at representing
constraint satisfaction like partial problems. To our knowledge, this is the
first paper to claim and verify that different NL logical reasoning problem
corresponds to different optimal SL formalization for translation. Based on
this, we propose a methods to improve the logical reasoning performance of LLMs
by adaptively selecting the most suitable SL for each problem prior to
translation. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to select the target SL among
first-order logic, logic programming and Boolean satisfiability and then
translate the problem in NL to target SL expressions as well as employ the
corresponding logical solver to derive the final answer. Experimental results
on benchmarks show that our adaptive selection method significantly outperforms
translating all into single SL and randomly selecting the SL. On a mixed
dataset of these benchmarks, our approach achieves 96% accuracy, which
improving performance by 25% compared to the second highest accuracy from the
first-order logic translation.

*Enric Junque de Fortuny,Veronica Roberta Cappelli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个框架来评估大型语言模型是否具备真正的战略思维能力，通过分析信念形成、行动评估和基于信念的选择过程，发现前沿模型在特定推理深度下表现出信念一致的最佳响应行为，并展现出元推理能力和新颖启发式规则的形成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要评估LLMs在均衡策略或推理深度方面的表现，但对其是否具备真正的战略思维能力（即连贯地形成对其他智能体的信念、评估可能行动并基于这些信念做出选择）仍缺乏探索。

Method: 开发了一个框架来在静态、完全信息博弈中分离信念、评估和选择过程，通过分析模型的显性选择和推理轨迹，并引入新的上下文无关游戏来排除记忆模仿的影响。

Result: 当前前沿模型在目标推理深度下表现出信念一致的最佳响应行为；在无约束时会自我限制推理深度，并对人类和合成对手形成差异化猜想；在复杂度增加时，显式递归让位于内部生成的稳定、模型特定的启发式选择规则。

Conclusion: 信念一致性、元推理和新颖启发式形成可以从语言建模目标中共同涌现，为研究人工智能体的战略认知提供了结构化基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to domains that require
reasoning about other agents' behavior, such as negotiation, policy design, and
market simulation, yet existing research has mostly evaluated their adherence
to equilibrium play or their exhibited depth of reasoning. Whether they display
genuine strategic thinking, understood as the coherent formation of beliefs
about other agents, evaluation of possible actions, and choice based on those
beliefs, remains unexplored. We develop a framework to identify this ability by
disentangling beliefs, evaluation, and choice in static, complete-information
games, and apply it across a series of non-cooperative environments. By jointly
analyzing models' revealed choices and reasoning traces, and introducing a new
context-free game to rule out imitation from memorization, we show that current
frontier models exhibit belief-coherent best-response behavior at targeted
reasoning depths. When unconstrained, they self-limit their depth of reasoning
and form differentiated conjectures about human and synthetic opponents,
revealing an emergent form of meta-reasoning. Under increasing complexity,
explicit recursion gives way to internally generated heuristic rules of choice
that are stable, model-specific, and distinct from known human biases. These
findings indicate that belief coherence, meta-reasoning, and novel heuristic
formation can emerge jointly from language modeling objectives, providing a
structured basis for the study of strategic cognition in artificial agents.

*Meiru Zhang,Philipp Borchert,Milan Gritta,Gerasimos Lampouras*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DRIFT框架通过将非正式数学陈述分解为更小的子组件，改进前提检索，显著提升自动形式化性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在数学自动形式化中难以识别和利用前提数学知识的问题，传统检索方法因非正式陈述复杂且上下文有限而效果不佳

Method: 引入DRIFT框架，将非正式数学陈述分解为子组件，从Mathlib等数学库进行针对性前提检索，并检索示例定理帮助模型更有效使用前提

Result: 在多个基准测试中一致提升前提检索性能，ProofNet上F1分数相比DPR基线几乎翻倍，在ConNF基准上BEq+@10分别提升37.14%(GPT-4.1)和42.25%(DeepSeek-V3.1)

Conclusion: 数学自动形式化中的检索效果高度依赖模型特定知识边界，需要与各模型能力相匹配的自适应检索策略

Abstract: Automating the formalization of mathematical statements for theorem proving
remains a major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs struggle to
identify and utilize the prerequisite mathematical knowledge and its
corresponding formal representation in languages like Lean. Current
retrieval-augmented autoformalization methods query external libraries using
the informal statement directly, but overlook a fundamental limitation:
informal mathematical statements are often complex and offer limited context on
the underlying math concepts. To address this, we introduce DRIFT, a novel
framework that enables LLMs to decompose informal mathematical statements into
smaller, more tractable ''sub-components''. This facilitates targeted retrieval
of premises from mathematical libraries such as Mathlib. Additionally, DRIFT
retrieves illustrative theorems to help models use premises more effectively in
formalization tasks. We evaluate DRIFT across diverse benchmarks (ProofNet,
ConNF, and MiniF2F-test) and find that it consistently improves premise
retrieval, nearly doubling the F1 score compared to the DPR baseline on
ProofNet. Notably, DRIFT demonstrates strong performance on the
out-of-distribution ConNF benchmark, with BEq+@10 improvements of 37.14% and
42.25% using GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3.1, respectively. Our analysis shows that
retrieval effectiveness in mathematical autoformalization depends heavily on
model-specific knowledge boundaries, highlighting the need for adaptive
retrieval strategies aligned with each model's capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出了一个框架来表征具身AI中的神经症行为：这些行为内部一致但与现实错位，源于规划、不确定性处理和厌恶记忆的相互作用。在网格导航系统中识别了多种神经症模式，并开发了在线检测器和逃逸策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究具身AI中出现的神经症行为模式，这些行为虽然内部逻辑一致但与现实环境不匹配，可能导致系统性能下降和安全风险。

Method: 在网格导航系统中识别神经症模式，开发轻量级在线检测器和可重用逃逸策略，使用遗传编程进行破坏性测试以最大化神经症评分。

Result: 识别了多种神经症模式（如翻转变换、计划混乱、固执循环等），开发了有效的检测和逃逸机制，发现即使在全可见性条件下，习得的厌恶成本仍会导致持久回避行为。

Conclusion: 局部修复不足以解决全局故障，需要通过破坏性测试暴露系统架构层面的问题，而不仅仅是症状层面的修补。

Abstract: We present a framework for characterizing neurosis in embodied AI: behaviors
that are internally coherent yet misaligned with reality, arising from
interactions among planning, uncertainty handling, and aversive memory. In a
grid navigation stack we catalogue recurrent modalities including flip-flop,
plan churn, perseveration loops, paralysis and hypervigilance, futile search,
belief incoherence, tie break thrashing, corridor thrashing, optimality
compulsion, metric mismatch, policy oscillation, and limited-visibility
variants. For each we give lightweight online detectors and reusable escape
policies (short commitments, a margin to switch, smoothing, principled
arbitration). We then show that durable phobic avoidance can persist even under
full visibility when learned aversive costs dominate local choice, producing
long detours despite globally safe routes. Using First/Second/Third Law as
engineering shorthand for safety latency, command compliance, and resource
efficiency, we argue that local fixes are insufficient; global failures can
remain. To surface them, we propose genetic-programming based destructive
testing that evolves worlds and perturbations to maximize law pressure and
neurosis scores, yielding adversarial curricula and counterfactual traces that
expose where architectural revision, not merely symptom-level patches, is
required.

*Renxuan Tan,Rongpeng Li,Fei Wang,Chenghui Peng,Shaoyun Wu,Zhifeng Zhao,Honggang Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于博弈论和LLM的多智能体深度强化学习框架，用于自动生成自适应MAC协议，解决了传统DRL协议泛化性差和需要频繁重训练的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MAC协议需要手动配置，而基于深度强化学习的协议虽然能提升特定任务性能，但泛化性和鲁棒性差，需要昂贵的重训练来适应动态环境。

Method: 将基站与用户设备的上行传输建模为动态多跟随者Stackelberg博弈，使用LLM驱动的智能体通过近端策略优化协调，结合协议动作语法来生成自适应语义MAC协议。

Result: 仿真显示该框架相比传统基线实现了77.6%的吞吐量提升和65.2%的公平性改善，且能很好地泛化到用户数量变化的情况而无需重训练。

Conclusion: 该LLM赋能的博弈论多智能体DRL框架能够自动生成自适应MAC协议，显著提升网络性能并具有优异的泛化能力。

Abstract: Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols, essential for wireless networks, are
typically manually configured. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based
protocols enhance task-specified network performance, they suffer from poor
generalizability and resilience, demanding costly retraining to adapt to
dynamic environments. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
game-theoretic LLM-empowered multi-agent DRL (MARL) framework, in which the
uplink transmission between a base station and a varying number of user
equipments is modeled as a dynamic multi-follower Stackelberg game (MFSG),
capturing the network's natural hierarchical structure. Within this game,
LLM-driven agents, coordinated through proximal policy optimization (PPO),
synthesize adaptive, semantic MAC protocols in response to network dynamics.
Protocol action grammar (PAG) is employed to ensure the reliability and
efficiency of this process. Under this system, we further analyze the existence
and convergence behavior in terms of a Stackelberg equilibrium by studying the
learning dynamics of LLM-empowered unified policies in response to changing
followers. Simulations corroborate that our framework achieves a 77.6% greater
throughput and a 65.2% fairness improvement over conventional baselines.
Besides, our framework generalizes excellently to a fluctuating number of users
without requiring retraining or architectural changes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作主要局限于单篇论文内的无工具任务，缺乏真实研究场景中跨论文推理和多工具协调的基准。

Method: 构建PaperArena基准，提供模块化可扩展平台，包含多模态解析、上下文检索和程序化计算等工具，评估代理整合多篇论文信息的能力。

Result: 最先进的LLM代理系统仅达到38.78%平均准确率，困难子集准确率降至18.47%，所有代理都表现出工具使用效率低下的问题。

Conclusion: PaperArena揭示了当前科学发现代理系统的局限性，邀请社区采用该基准来开发更强大的代理系统。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning on the web-scale scientific literature is a
crucial touchstone for large language model (LLM) based agents designed to
support complex knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing works are mainly
restricted to tool-free tasks within isolated papers, largely due to the lack
of a benchmark for cross-paper reasoning and multi-tool orchestration in real
research scenarios. In this work, we propose PaperArena, an evaluation
benchmark for agents to address real-world research questions that typically
require integrating information across multiple papers with the assistance of
external tools. Given a research question, agents should integrate diverse
formats across multiple papers through reasoning and interacting with
appropriate tools, thereby producing a well-grounded answer. To support
standardized evaluation, we provide a modular and extensible platform for agent
execution, offering tools such as multimodal parsing, context retrieval, and
programmatic computation. Experimental results reveal that even the most
advanced LLM powering a well-established agent system achieves merely 38.78%
average accuracy. On the hard subset, accuracy drops to only 18.47%,
highlighting great potential for improvement. We also present several empirical
findings, including that all agents tested exhibit inefficient tool usage,
often invoking more tools than necessary to solve a task. We invite the
community to adopt PaperArena to develop and evaluate more capable agents for
scientific discovery. Our code and data are available

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Proof-of-Use (PoU)框架，通过证据基础的强化学习解决RAG代理中的工具调用黑客问题，确保检索证据与最终答案之间的因果联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的RAG代理存在工具调用黑客问题，即代理通过表面正确的工具调用来夸大奖励信号，而不真正利用检索证据，导致模式崩溃和虚假接地。

Method: PoU框架通过统一的逐步合同实现，结合语法引用验证、基于扰动的敏感性奖励和答案-证据对齐目标，确保工具使用的可解释性和功能性接地。

Result: 在七个QA基准测试中，PoU在事实准确性、证据忠实度和工具路由平衡方面持续优于DeepResearch基线，涵盖域内、域外和工具分布外设置。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于RL训练的代理不仅需要在任务结果上接地，还需要在检索信息的因果使用上接地，为可信的检索增强推理提供了原则性路径。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) agents, such as recent
DeepResearch-style systems, extend large language models (LLMs) with autonomous
information-seeking capabilities through external tools. While reinforcement
learning (RL) has enabled impressive multi-step reasoning, we identify a
previously overlooked failure mode, Tool-Call Hacking, where agents inflate
reward signals by issuing superficially correct tool calls without genuinely
leveraging the retrieved evidence. This results in (i) mode collapse into
repetitive reliance on a single source and (ii) spurious grounding, where
answers are only weakly supported by cited content.
  To address this, we propose Proof-of-Use (PoU), an evidence-grounded RL
framework that enforces verifiable causal links between retrieved evidence,
reasoning traces, and final answers. PoU operationalizes this through a unified
step-wise contract combining syntactic citation validation, perturbation-based
sensitivity rewards, and answer-evidence alignment objectives, ensuring that
tool usage remains both interpretable and functionally grounded.
  Across seven QA benchmarks spanning in-domain, out-of-domain, and
out-of-tool-distribution settings, PoU consistently outperforms strong
DeepResearch baselines in factual accuracy, evidence faithfulness, and
tool-routing balance. These findings highlight the necessity of grounding
RL-trained agents not merely in task outcomes but in the causal use of
retrieved information, offering a principled path toward trustworthy
retrieval-augmented reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于关键词搜索或静态嵌入的检索方法难以处理需要跨异构系统进行上下文推理和多跳推断的复杂查询。

Method: 构建统一知识图谱，集成KBLam模型、DeepGraph表示和语义搜索，通过查询分析动态确定最优检索策略，支持结构化和非结构化数据源的独立或融合处理。

Result: 在大规模Git仓库上的实验表明，统一推理层相比独立的GPT检索流程将答案相关性提高了80%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合图构建、混合推理和交互式可视化，为企业环境中的智能知识助手提供了可扩展、可解释和以用户为中心的基础。

Abstract: Modern enterprises manage vast knowledge distributed across heterogeneous
systems such as Jira, Git repositories, Confluence, and wikis. Conventional
retrieval methods based on keyword search or static embeddings often fail to
answer complex queries that require contextual reasoning and multi-hop
inference across artifacts. We present a modular hybrid retrieval framework for
adaptive enterprise information access that integrates Knowledge Base
Language-Augmented Models (KBLam), DeepGraph representations, and
embedding-driven semantic search. The framework builds a unified knowledge
graph from parsed repositories including code, pull requests, and commit
histories, enabling semantic similarity search, structural inference, and
multi-hop reasoning. Query analysis dynamically determines the optimal
retrieval strategy, supporting both structured and unstructured data sources
through independent or fused processing. An interactive interface provides
graph visualizations, subgraph exploration, and context-aware query routing to
generate concise and explainable answers. Experiments on large-scale Git
repositories show that the unified reasoning layer improves answer relevance by
up to 80 percent compared with standalone GPT-based retrieval pipelines. By
combining graph construction, hybrid reasoning, and interactive visualization,
the proposed framework offers a scalable, explainable, and user-centric
foundation for intelligent knowledge assistants in enterprise environments.

Conclusion: Video-STR通过图强化学习方法有效解决了MLLMs在精确时空理解方面的局限性，为需要高精度时空推理的应用提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has demonstrated
strong semantic understanding capabilities, but struggles to perform precise
spatio-temporal understanding. Existing spatio-temporal methods primarily focus
on the video itself, while overlooking the physical information within the
video, such as multi-object layouts and motion. Such limitations restrict the
use of MLLMs in downstream applications that demand high precision, including
embodied intelligence and VR. To address this issue, we present Video-STR, a
novel graph-based reinforcement method for precise Video Spatio-Temporal
Reasoning. Building upon the capacity of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Reward (RLVR) to improve model abilities, we introduce a reasoning mechanism
using graph-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) method to guide the
model in inferring the underlying spatio-temporal topology of scenarios during
the thinking process. To resolve the lack of spatio-temporal training data, we
construct the STV-205k dataset with 205k question-answering pairs, covering
dynamic multi-object scenes in both indoor and outdoor environments, to support
the model training. Experiments show that Video-STR achieves state-of-the-art
results on various benchmarks, outperforming the base model by 13% on
STI-Bench, and demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach and dataset.
Code, model, and data will be released.

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了模型插值的内在机制，为构建具有精确目标推理能力的模型提供了实用框架。

Abstract: Model merging, typically on Instruct and Thinking models, has shown
remarkable performance for efficient reasoning. In this paper, we
systematically revisit the simplest merging method that interpolates two
weights directly. Particularly, we observe that model interpolation follows a
three-stage evolutionary paradigm with distinct behaviors on the reasoning
trajectory. These dynamics provide a principled guide for navigating the
performance-cost trade-off. Empirical results demonstrate that a strategically
interpolated model surprisingly surpasses sophisticated model merging baselines
on both efficiency and effectiveness. We further validate our findings with
extensive ablation studies on model layers, modules, and decoding strategies.
Ultimately, this work demystifies model interpolation and offers a practical
framework for crafting models with precisely targeted reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 制造系统中识别故障原因对维持和提高生产效率至关重要，需要知识库明确结构化系统知识和故障知识，并包含足够长的故障因果链。

Method: 构建诊断知识本体，提出基于功能-行为-结构(FBS)模型的维护记录积累方法。

Result: 使用该方法积累的维护记录进行故障原因推断，与专家列举的候选原因集有更好的一致性，特别是在相关案例少、使用词汇不同的困难情况下。

Conclusion: 未来需要开发针对这些维护记录的推断方法，构建用户界面，并在更大更多样化的系统上进行验证。该方法有望成为整个工程链知识共享的基础。

Abstract: In manufacturing systems, identifying the causes of failures is crucial for
maintaining and improving production efficiency. In knowledge-based
failure-cause inference, it is important that the knowledge base (1) explicitly
structures knowledge about the target system and about failures, and (2)
contains sufficiently long causal chains of failures. In this study, we
constructed Diagnostic Knowledge Ontology and proposed a
Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) model-based maintenance-record accumulation
method based on it. Failure-cause inference using the maintenance records
accumulated by the proposed method showed better agreement with the set of
candidate causes enumerated by experts, especially in difficult cases where the
number of related cases is small and the vocabulary used differs. In the
future, it will be necessary to develop inference methods tailored to these
maintenance records, build a user interface, and carry out validation on larger
and more diverse systems. Additionally, this approach leverages the
understanding and knowledge of the target in the design phase to support
knowledge accumulation and problem solving during the maintenance phase, and it
is expected to become a foundation for knowledge sharing across the entire
engineering chain in the future.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统在法律环境中的不透明性对公平性、问责制和信任构成挑战，黑箱问题削弱了自动化决策的合法性，需要符合法律要求的解释方法。

Method: 分析不同解释策略的优缺点，评估其在法律推理中的适用性，重点研究计算论证框架如何捕捉法律的可废止性、可争议性和价值敏感性特征。

Result: 论证框架为可解释法律AI提供了特别稳健的基础，能够更好地满足法律领域的透明性要求。

Conclusion: 计算论证方法最能满足法律领域的技术和规范透明性要求，但仍需解决偏见缓解、司法环境实证验证等开放挑战。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly deployed in legal
contexts, where their opacity raises significant challenges for fairness,
accountability, and trust. The so-called ``black box problem'' undermines the
legitimacy of automated decision-making, as affected individuals often lack
access to meaningful explanations. In response, the field of Explainable AI
(XAI) has proposed a variety of methods to enhance transparency, ranging from
example-based and rule-based techniques to hybrid and argumentation-based
approaches. This paper promotes computational models of arguments and their
role in providing legally relevant explanations, with particular attention to
their alignment with emerging regulatory frameworks such as the EU General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA). We
analyze the strengths and limitations of different explanation strategies,
evaluate their applicability to legal reasoning, and highlight how
argumentation frameworks -- by capturing the defeasible, contestable, and
value-sensitive nature of law -- offer a particularly robust foundation for
explainable legal AI. Finally, we identify open challenges and research
directions, including bias mitigation, empirical validation in judicial
settings, and compliance with evolving ethical and legal standards, arguing
that computational argumentation is best positioned to meet both technical and
normative requirements of transparency in the law domain.

Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology,
socio-economic systems are entering a new stage of "human-AI co-creation."
Building upon a previously established multi-level intelligent agent economic

that: (1) when AI functions as an independent productive entity, the overall
growth rate of social output far exceeds that of traditional human-labor-based
models; (2) China demonstrates clear potential for acceleration in both the
expansion of intelligent agent populations and the pace of technological

even partial surpassing. This study provides a systematic, model-based
analytical framework for understanding AI-driven production system

Abstract: The steady growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has accelerated in the
recent years, facilitated by the development of sophisticated models such as
large language models and foundation models. Ensuring robust and reliable power
infrastructures is fundamental to take advantage of the full potential of AI.
However, AI data centres are extremely hungry for power, putting the problem of
their power management in the spotlight, especially with respect to their
impact on environment and sustainable development. In this work, we investigate
the capacity and limits of solutions based on an innovative approach for the
power management of AI data centres, i.e., making part of the input power as
dynamic as the power used for data-computing functions. The performance of
passive and active devices are quantified and compared in terms of
computational gain, energy efficiency, reduction of capital expenditure, and
management costs by analysing power trends from multiple data platforms
worldwide. This strategy, which identifies a paradigm shift in the AI data
centre power management, has the potential to strongly improve the
sustainability of AI hyperscalers, enhancing their footprint on environmental,

### [441] [Spec-Driven AI for Science: The ARIA Framework for Automated and Reproducible Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11143)
*Chuke Chen,Biao Luo,Nan Li,Boxiang Wang,Hang Yang,Jing Guo,Ming Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARIA是一个基于规范驱动的、人机协作的自动化可解释数据分析框架，通过自然语言规范定义分析目标，自动生成可执行代码并验证计算，实现透明文档化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学数据的快速增长导致分析能力与研究意图之间存在差距，现有AI分析工具要么偏向自动化而缺乏透明度，要么依赖手动脚本影响可扩展性和可重复性。

Method: ARIA采用六层互操作架构（命令、上下文、代码、数据、编排和AI模块），在文档中心化工作流中统一人类推理和机器执行，通过自然语言规范驱动分析过程。

Result: 在波士顿房价案例中，ARIA发现了25个关键特征并确定XGBoost为最佳模型（R平方=0.93），过拟合最小。跨领域评估显示ARIA在性能、可解释性和效率方面优于最先进系统。

Conclusion: ARIA通过将AI研究原则与科学原则结合在规范驱动架构中，为透明、协作和可重复的科学发现建立了新范式。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of scientific data has widened the gap between analytical
capability and research intent. Existing AI-based analysis tools, ranging from
AutoML frameworks to agentic research assistants, either favor automation over
transparency or depend on manual scripting that hinders scalability and
reproducibility. We present ARIA (Automated Research Intelligence Assistant), a
spec-driven, human-in-the-loop framework for automated and interpretable data
analysis. ARIA integrates six interoperable layers, namely Command, Context,
Code, Data, Orchestration, and AI Module, within a document-centric workflow
that unifies human reasoning and machine execution. Through natural-language
specifications, researchers define analytical goals while ARIA autonomously
generates executable code, validates computations, and produces transparent
documentation. Beyond achieving high predictive accuracy, ARIA can rapidly
identify optimal feature sets and select suitable models, minimizing redundant
tuning and repetitive experimentation. In the Boston Housing case, ARIA
discovered 25 key features and determined XGBoost as the best performing model
(R square = 0.93) with minimal overfitting. Evaluations across heterogeneous
domains demonstrate ARIA's strong performance, interpretability, and efficiency
compared with state-of-the-art systems. By combining AI for research and AI for
science principles within a spec-driven architecture, ARIA establishes a new
paradigm for transparent, collaborative, and reproducible scientific discovery.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: An agent facing a planning problem can use answers to how-to questions to
reduce uncertainty and fill knowledge gaps, helping it solve both current and
future tasks. However, their open ended nature, where valid answers to "How do
I X?" range from executable actions to high-level descriptions of X's
sub-goals, makes them challenging for AI agents to ask, and for AI experts to
answer, in ways that support efficient planning. We introduce $How^{2}$, a
memory agent framework that enables agents to ask how-to questions, store the
answers, and reuse them for lifelong learning in interactive environments. We
evaluate our approach in Plancraft, a Minecraft crafting environment, where
agents must complete an assembly task by manipulating inventory items. Using
teacher models that answer at varying levels of abstraction, from executable
action sequences to high-level subgoal descriptions, we show that lifelong
learning agents benefit most from answers that are abstracted and decoupled
from the current state. $How^{2}$ offers a way for LLM-based agents to improve
their planning capabilities over time by asking questions in interactive
environments.

*Peiming Li,Zhiyuan Hu,Yang Tang,Shiyu Li,Xi Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了CDRA方法，将LLM对齐从标量奖励匹配重构为结构化推理过程，通过DeepPref基准和Pers-GenPRM模型解决用户深层偏好推断和防御性推理的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法无法推断用户的深层隐含偏好（未明说的目标、语义上下文和风险容忍度），且缺乏应对现实世界模糊性的防御性推理，导致响应肤浅、脆弱和短视。

Method: 1. 引入DeepPref基准数据集（3000个偏好-查询对，涵盖20个主题），通过模拟多面认知委员会生成带批判注释的推理链；2. 提出Pers-GenPRM模型，将奖励建模重构为个性化推理任务，生成批判链评估响应与用户偏好的一致性；3. 使用批判驱动策略对齐进行过程级在线强化学习。

Result: 实验表明CDRA在发现和适应用户真实偏好方面表现优异，同时执行稳健的推理。

Conclusion: CDRA通过结构化推理过程有效解决了LLM个性化对齐中的认知差距问题，实现了更深入的用户偏好理解和更稳健的推理能力。

Abstract: Personalized alignment is crucial for enabling Large Language Models (LLMs)
to engage effectively in user-centric interactions. However, current methods
face a dual challenge: they fail to infer users' deep implicit preferences
(including unstated goals, semantic context and risk tolerances), and they lack
the defensive reasoning required to navigate real-world ambiguity. This
cognitive gap leads to responses that are superficial, brittle and
short-sighted. To address this, we propose Critique-Driven Reasoning Alignment
(CDRA), which reframes alignment from a scalar reward-matching task into a
structured reasoning process. First, to bridge the preference inference gap, we
introduce the DeepPref benchmark. This dataset, comprising 3000
preference-query pairs across 20 topics, is curated by simulating a
multi-faceted cognitive council that produces critique-annotated reasoning
chains to deconstruct query semantics and reveal latent risks. Second, to
instill defensive reasoning, we introduce the Personalized Generative Process
Reward Model (Pers-GenPRM), which frames reward modeling as a personalized
reasoning task. It generates a critique chain to evaluate a response's
alignment with user preferences before outputting a final score based on this
rationale. Ultimately, this interpretable, structured reward signal guides
policy model through Critique-Driven Policy Alignment, a process-level online
reinforcement learning algorithm integrating both numerical and natural
language feedback. Experiments demonstrate that CDRA excels at discovering and
aligning with users' true preferences while executing robust reasoning. Our
code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Zephyrian-Hugh/Deep-pref.

*Leonard Dung,Florian Mai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文分析了7种代表性AI对齐技术和7种故障模式，研究它们在故障模式上的重叠程度，以评估防御深度策略的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI对齐技术都存在故障模式，防御深度策略依赖于不同技术的故障模式不相关。如果所有技术的故障模式相同，防御深度就无法提供额外保护。

Method: 分析7种代表性对齐技术和7种故障模式，评估它们之间的重叠程度。

Result: 研究揭示了不同对齐技术在故障模式上的重叠情况，为评估防御深度策略的有效性提供了实证基础。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于理解当前AI安全风险水平，并为未来AI对齐研究的优先级排序提供指导。

Abstract: AI alignment research aims to develop techniques to ensure that AI systems do
not cause harm. However, every alignment technique has failure modes, which are
conditions in which there is a non-negligible chance that the technique fails
to provide safety. As a strategy for risk mitigation, the AI safety community
has increasingly adopted a defense-in-depth framework: Conceding that there is
no single technique which guarantees safety, defense-in-depth consists in
having multiple redundant protections against safety failure, such that safety
can be maintained even if some protections fail. However, the success of
defense-in-depth depends on how (un)correlated failure modes are across
alignment techniques. For example, if all techniques had the exact same failure
modes, the defense-in-depth approach would provide no additional protection at
all. In this paper, we analyze 7 representative alignment techniques and 7
failure modes to understand the extent to which they overlap. We then discuss
our results' implications for understanding the current level of risk and how
to prioritize AI alignment research in the future.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PADME是一个基于图表示的智能代理框架，能够将自然语言程序文本自动转换为可执行图，通过两阶段方法实现结构化建模和动态执行，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智能代理从自然语言程序（如菜谱、科学协议）中自主执行长时程任务的挑战，现有基于大语言模型的方法容易在执行过程中漂移或失败。

Method: 提出两阶段方法：Teach阶段将程序文本结构化并丰富可执行逻辑，Execute阶段根据实时输入和环境反馈进行动态执行；使用图表示捕获任务依赖、决策点和可重用子程序。

Result: 在ALFWorld和ScienceWorld等四个不同基准测试中达到最先进性能，证明基于图的程序表示提供了强大的中间抽象层，实现鲁棒和可泛化的执行。

Conclusion: 结构化程序建模对于可靠的代理驱动自动化至关重要，图表示提供了减少长时程推理中错误累积的归纳偏置，是构建稳健智能代理的有效方法。

Abstract: Learning to autonomously execute long-horizon procedures from natural
language remains a core challenge for intelligent agents. Free-form
instructions such as recipes, scientific protocols, or business workflows
encode rich procedural knowledge, but their variability and lack of structure
cause agents driven by large language models (LLMs) to drift or fail during
execution. We introduce Procedure Aware DynaMic Execution (PADME), an agent
framework that produces and exploits a graph-based representation of
procedures. Unlike prior work that relies on manual graph construction or
unstructured reasoning, PADME autonomously transforms procedural text into
executable graphs that capture task dependencies, decision points, and reusable
subroutines. Central to PADME is a two-phase methodology; Teach phase, which
focuses on systematic structuring, enrichment with executable logic of
procedures, followed by Execute phase, which enables dynamic execution in
response to real-time inputs and environment feedback. This separation ensures
quality assurance and scalability, allowing expert knowledge to be encoded once
and reliably reused across varying contexts. The graph representation also
provides an inductive bias that reduces error accumulation in long-horizon
reasoning, underscoring the importance of structured procedure modeling for
reliable agent-driven automation. Empirically, PADME achieves state-of-the-art
performance on four diverse benchmarks, including ALFWorld and ScienceWorld.
These results demonstrate that agents equipped with graph-based procedure
representations offer a powerful intermediate abstraction for robust and
generalizable execution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决教学流程建模的碎片化问题，克服智能体在模拟多样化教育参与者时的性能限制，为从"经验时代"迈向"模拟时代"提供基础。

Method: 构建Zero-Exp策略，采用连续"经验-反思-优化"循环机制，基于包含经验和知识库的双记忆库，整合短期和长期记忆组件，让智能体在多样化模拟学校场景中通过情境交互自主进化。

Result: 实验证实AAS能够有效模拟复杂教育动态，在培养高级智能体认知能力方面表现有效，生成高保真的行为和交互数据。

Conclusion: AAS系统为理解复杂人类系统和交互提供了重要工具，通过自进化机制实现了对真实教育环境中师生互动和学习过程的准确建模。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Agents are increasingly pivotal in
simulating and understanding complex human systems and interactions. We propose
the AI-Agent School (AAS) system, built around a self-evolving mechanism that
leverages agents for simulating complex educational dynamics. Addressing the
fragmented issues in teaching process modeling and the limitations of agents
performance in simulating diverse educational participants, AAS constructs the
Zero-Exp strategy, employs a continuous "experience-reflection-optimization"
cycle, grounded in a dual memory base comprising experience and knowledge bases
and incorporating short-term and long-term memory components. Through this
mechanism, agents autonomously evolve via situated interactions within diverse
simulated school scenarios. This evolution enables agents to more accurately
model the nuanced, multi-faceted teacher-student engagements and underlying
learning processes found in physical schools. Experiment confirms that AAS can
effectively simulate intricate educational dynamics and is effective in
fostering advanced agent cognitive abilities, providing a foundational stepping
stone from the "Era of Experience" to the "Era of Simulation" by generating
high-fidelity behavioral and interaction data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要标准化技能分解的评估流程，确保输出与本体论节点对齐，为开发忠实于本体论的技能分解系统提供可复现基础。

Method: 使用两种提示策略（零样本和防泄漏的少样本），在ROME-ESCO-DecompSkill数据集上进行实验，通过语义匹配和层次结构评估输出质量。

Result: 零样本提供强基线，少样本在稳定措辞和粒度方面表现更好，且延迟分析显示少样本提示有时比零样本更快。

Conclusion: 该框架、基准和指标为开发本体论忠实的技能分解系统提供了可复现的基础。

Abstract: This paper investigates automated skill decomposition using Large Language
Models (LLMs) and proposes a rigorous, ontology-grounded evaluation framework.
Our framework standardizes the pipeline from prompting and generation to
normalization and alignment with ontology nodes. To evaluate outputs, we
introduce two metrics: a semantic F1-score that uses optimal embedding-based
matching to assess content accuracy, and a hierarchy-aware F1-score that
credits structurally correct placements to assess granularity. We conduct
experiments on ROME-ESCO-DecompSkill, a curated subset of parents, comparing
two prompting strategies: zero-shot and leakage-safe few-shot with exemplars.
Across diverse LLMs, zero-shot offers a strong baseline, while few-shot
consistently stabilizes phrasing and granularity and improves hierarchy-aware
alignment. A latency analysis further shows that exemplar-guided prompts are
competitive - and sometimes faster - than unguided zero-shot due to more
schema-compliant completions. Together, the framework, benchmark, and metrics
provide a reproducible foundation for developing ontology-faithful skill
decomposition systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了维度级奖励模型(DRM)，通过置信度、相关性和连贯性三个维度来评估推理过程质量，解决了传统结果监督强化学习的稀疏奖励问题，提升了LLMs的多步推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的结果监督强化学习(RLVR)只奖励正确答案，存在推理错误传播和奖励稀疏问题；过程级奖励模型(PRMs)虽然提供更密集的反馈，但缺乏泛化性和可解释性，需要任务特定的推理过程分割。

Method: 提出维度级奖励模型(DRM)，从三个互补且可解释的维度评估推理过程：置信度（不确定性校准）、相关性（语义对齐）和连贯性（逻辑一致性），无需真实答案即可进行可解释的评估。

Result: 实验结果显示DRM提供有效的监督信号，指导LLMs优化并增强其推理能力。在数学、问答、代码执行和谜题等开放领域任务上，DRM监督训练在分布内和分布外都取得了一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: 多维度的推理过程监督可以提升LLMs在训练分布之外的泛化推理能力。

Abstract: Improving the multi-step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
a critical yet challenging task. The dominant paradigm, outcome-supervised
reinforcement learning (RLVR), rewards only correct final answers, often
propagating flawed reasoning and suffering from sparse reward signals. While
process-level reward models (PRMs) provide denser, step-by-step feedback, they
lack generalizability and interpretability, requiring task-specific
segmentation of the reasoning process. To this end, we propose the
Dimension-level Reward Model (DRM), a new supervision framework that bridges
the gap between these two approaches. DRM evaluates the quality of a reasoning
process along three fundamental, complementary, and interpretable dimensions:
Confidence for uncertainty calibration, Relevance for semantic alignment, and
Coherence for logical consistency. Together, these dimensions capture aspects
beyond final answer correctness and enable interpretable assessment without
requiring ground truth answers. Experimental results show that DRM provides
effective supervision signals, guides the optimization of LLMs and enhances
their reasoning ability. In particular, DRM-supervised training achieves
consistent gains on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution open-domain
tasks, including mathematics, question answering, code execution, and puzzles.
Our findings demonstrate that multidimensional supervision of the reasoning
process can improve the generalized reasoning ability of LLMs beyond the
training distribution.

TL;DR: DARK是一个在知识图谱上统一处理演绎和溯因推理的框架，通过掩码扩散模型实现查询与结论的双向关系建模，在两种推理任务上都达到了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将演绎推理（验证假设）和溯因推理（生成假设）分开处理，但它们具有明显的协同潜力，需要统一框架来充分利用这种互补关系。

Method: 提出DARK框架，包含两个关键创新：1）自反去噪过程，在溯因推理中迭代生成和验证候选假设；2）逻辑探索强化学习方法，同时掩码查询和结论以探索新的推理组合。

Result: 在多个基准知识图谱上的广泛实验表明，DARK在演绎和溯因推理任务上都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 统一处理演绎和溯因推理的方法具有显著优势，DARK框架成功展示了这种协同效应的价值。

Abstract: Deductive and abductive reasoning are two critical paradigms for analyzing
knowledge graphs, enabling applications from financial query answering to
scientific discovery. Deductive reasoning on knowledge graphs usually involves
retrieving entities that satisfy a complex logical query, while abductive
reasoning generates plausible logical hypotheses from observations. Despite
their clear synergistic potential, where deduction can validate hypotheses and
abduction can uncover deeper logical patterns, existing methods address them in
isolation. To bridge this gap, we propose DARK, a unified framework for
Deductive and Abductive Reasoning in Knowledge graphs. As a masked diffusion
model capable of capturing the bidirectional relationship between queries and
conclusions, DARK has two key innovations. First, to better leverage deduction
for hypothesis refinement during abductive reasoning, we introduce a
self-reflective denoising process that iteratively generates and validates
candidate hypotheses against the observed conclusion. Second, to discover
richer logical associations, we propose a logic-exploration reinforcement
learning approach that simultaneously masks queries and conclusions, enabling
the model to explore novel reasoning compositions. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark knowledge graphs show that DARK achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both deductive and abductive reasoning tasks, demonstrating the
significant benefits of our unified approach.

Abstract: Governance of data, compliance, and business privacy matters, particularly
for healthcare and finance businesses. Since the recent emergence of AI
enterprise AI assistants enhancing business productivity, safeguarding private
data and compliance is now a priority. With the implementation of AI assistants
across the enterprise, the zero data retention can be achieved by implementing
zero data retention policies by Large Language Model businesses like Open AI

for the Enterprise apps of large language models (LLMs). Our key contribution
is defining the architectural, compliance, and usability trade-offs of such
systems in parallel. In this research work, we examine the development of
commercial AI assistants with two industry leaders and market titans in this
arena - Salesforce and Microsoft. Both of these companies used distinct
technical architecture to support zero data retention policies. Salesforce
AgentForce and Microsoft Copilot are among the leading AI assistants providing
much-needed push to business productivity in customer care. The purpose of this
paper is to analyze the technical architecture and deployment of zero data
retention policy by consuming applications as well as big language models
service providers like Open Ai, Anthropic, and Meta.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了CC-Gen基准生成器和CAP-CPT方法，用于解决LLM代理系统中政策文档内部化问题，通过可控复杂度的政策文档和分类感知的持续预训练，显著提升代理处理复杂政策的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理系统依赖政策文档，但随着需求增长文档迅速膨胀导致计算开销大，需要将政策文档嵌入模型先验中，同时保持性能。现有提示压缩方法针对通用提示，但代理政策文档涉及多复杂度级别和深度推理，内部化更困难。

Method: 引入CC-Gen基准生成器，提供四个可控复杂度级别；提出CAP-CPT方法，自动解析政策文档提取关键规范，分为事实性、行为性和条件性类别，通过自回归预训练损失实现政策内部化。

Result: CAP-CPT在所有设置下都优于SFT基线，在Qwen-3-32B上提升达41%和22%，在CC-Gen上实现97.3%的提示长度减少，仅需少量SFT数据即可增强tau-Bench性能。

Conclusion: 复杂政策规范对工作流程构成主要推理挑战，CAP-CPT通过分类感知的持续预训练有效减轻数据和推理负担，显著提升政策内部化效果。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems rely on in-context policy
documents encoding diverse business rules. As requirements grow, these
documents expand rapidly, causing high computational overhead. This motivates
developing internalization methods that embed policy documents into model
priors while preserving performance. Prior prompt compression work targets
generic prompts, but agentic policy documents span multiple complexity levels
and require deeper reasoning, making internalization harder. We introduce
CC-Gen, an agentic benchmark generator with Controllable Complexity across four
levels, enabling systematic evaluation of agents' ability to handle complexity
and offering a unified framework for assessing policy internalization. Our
analysis shows that complex policy specifications governing workflows pose
major reasoning challenges. Supporting internalization with gold user agent
interaction trajectories containing chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations via
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is data-intensive and degrades sharply as policy
complexity increases. To mitigate data and reasoning burdens, we propose
Category-Aware Policy Continued Pretraining (CAP-CPT). Our automated pipeline
parses policy documents to extract key specifications, grouping them into
factual, behavioral, and conditional categories, and isolating complex
conditions that drive workflow complexity. This guides targeted data synthesis
and enables agents to internalize policy information through an autoregressive
pretraining loss. Experiments show CAP-CPT improves SFT baselines in all
settings, with up to 41% and 22% gains on Qwen-3-32B, achieving 97.3% prompt
length reduction on CC-Gen and further enhancing tau-Bench with minimal SFT
data.

Motivation: 当前AI政策制定者面临信息环境信号噪声比过低的问题，导致监管捕获和风险优先级分歧。AI研究缺乏严格科学标准和可复现性协议，削弱了政策制定者实施有效治理的能力。

Method: 评估AI研究中即将出现的可复现性危机，借鉴其他科学领域的危机经验，提出采用预注册、提高统计功效和发表阴性结果等可复现性协议。

Result: 论文认为采用严格的可复现性协议可以帮助改善AI风险格局的共识，并为政策制定者提供更可靠的信息基础。

Conclusion: 虽然AI治理必须保持反应性，但政策制定者应将可复现性协议视为治理工具箱的核心工具，并要求AI研究达到更高标准。

Abstract: AI policymakers are responsible for delivering effective governance
mechanisms that can provide safe, aligned and trustworthy AI development.
However, the information environment offered to policymakers is characterised
by an unnecessarily low Signal-To-Noise Ratio, favouring regulatory capture and
creating deep uncertainty and divides on which risks should be prioritised from
a governance perspective. We posit that the current publication speeds in AI
combined with the lack of strong scientific standards, via weak reproducibility
protocols, effectively erodes the power of policymakers to enact meaningful
policy and governance protocols. Our paper outlines how AI research could adopt
stricter reproducibility guidelines to assist governance endeavours and improve
consensus on the AI risk landscape. We evaluate the forthcoming reproducibility
crisis within AI research through the lens of crises in other scientific
domains; providing a commentary on how adopting preregistration, increased
statistical power and negative result publication reproducibility protocols can
enable effective AI governance. While we maintain that AI governance must be
reactive due to AI's significant societal implications we argue that
policymakers and governments must consider reproducibility protocols as a core
tool in the governance arsenal and demand higher standards for AI research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前客户流失模型多为黑盒，缺乏对流失原因、干预时机和高风险客户群体的洞察，需要从单纯预测转向基于可解释证据的个性化保留策略。

Method: 集成可解释AI量化特征贡献、生存分析建模流失时间风险、RFM分析按交易行为细分客户的三组件框架。

Result: 能够识别流失驱动因素、估计干预时间窗口、优先确定需要针对性行动的高风险客户群体。

Conclusion: 该框架支持减少客户流失和增强客户忠诚度的策略，将预测模型转化为可操作的保留策略。

Abstract: In online retail, customer acquisition typically incurs higher costs than
customer retention, motivating firms to invest in churn analytics. However,
many contemporary churn models operate as opaque black boxes, limiting insight
into the determinants of attrition, the timing of retention opportunities, and
the identification of high-risk customer segments. Accordingly, the emphasis
should shift from prediction alone to the design of personalized retention
strategies grounded in interpretable evidence. This study advances a
three-component framework that integrates explainable AI to quantify feature
contributions, survival analysis to model time-to-event churn risk, and RFM
profiling to segment customers by transactional behaviour. In combination,
these methods enable the attribution of churn drivers, estimation of
intervention windows, and prioritization of segments for targeted actions,
thereby supporting strategies that reduce attrition and strengthen customer
loyalty.

Method: 基于Overcooked游戏设计ParaCook环境，提供简化的动作空间来专注于战略并行规划的核心挑战，通过烹饪任务实例化多智能体系统的交互规划。

Result: 对最先进LLM的评估显示，当前方法生成的规划效果不佳，难以处理并行动作或协调问题，但在抽象任务中LLM表现出并行优化的潜力。

Conclusion: ParaCook提供了一个可扩展的评估框架，为开发和评估时间效率感知的多智能体规划奠定了基础，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning abilities for planning
long-horizon, real-world tasks, yet existing agent benchmarks focus on task
completion while neglecting time efficiency in parallel and asynchronous
operations. To address this, we present ParaCook, a benchmark for
time-efficient collaborative planning. Inspired by the Overcooked game,
ParaCook provides an environment for various challenging interaction planning
of multi-agent systems that are instantiated as cooking tasks, with a
simplified action space to isolate the core challenge of strategic parallel
planning. Through a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, we find
that current approaches achieve suboptimal plans, which struggle with parallel
actions or coordination. Our analysis also reveals LLMs' potential on abstract
tasks where they can focus on high-level parallel optimization. ParaCook
provides a scalable evaluation framework with adjustable complexity,
establishing a foundation for developing and assessing time efficiency-aware
multi-agent planning. The code and data are available at

Result: 在四个科学领域的数据集上，SR-Scientist比基线方法绝对提升了6%-35%，表现出对噪声的鲁棒性、发现方程对域外数据的泛化能力以及符号准确性。

Conclusion: SR-Scientist成功地将LLM转变为自主AI科学家，在科学方程发现任务中取得了显著性能提升，并展示了良好的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied to scientific
equation discovery, leveraging their embedded scientific knowledge for
hypothesis generation. However, current methods typically confine LLMs to the
role of an equation proposer within search algorithms like genetic programming.
In this paper, we present SR-Scientist, a framework that elevates the LLM from
a simple equation proposer to an autonomous AI scientist that writes code to
analyze data, implements the equation as code, submits it for evaluation, and
optimizes the equation based on experimental feedback. Specifically, we wrap
the code interpreter into a set of tools for data analysis and equation
evaluation. The agent is instructed to optimize the equation by utilizing these
tools over a long horizon with minimal human-defined pipelines. Empirical
results show that SR-Scientist outperforms baseline methods by an absolute
margin of 6% to 35% on datasets covering four science disciplines.
Additionally, we demonstrate our method's robustness to noise, the
generalization of the discovered equations to out-of-domain data, and their
symbolic accuracy. Furthermore, we develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning
framework to enhance the agent's capabilities.

Motivation: 传统的多智能体编排框架在机器学习工程生命周期中存在效率问题，作者希望通过单一智能体架构来整合所有MLE阶段。

Method: 采用单智能体、IDE基础的架构，在线性、非阻塞的环境中整合探索、建模、实验和部署等所有MLE生命周期阶段。

Result: 在MLE-Benchmark (2025)上实现了新的SOTA结果，整体奖牌率为0.3956 +/- 0.0565，在75个问题中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 在受控IDE环境中运行的线性非阻塞单智能体能够超越多智能体和编排系统，证明了单智能体架构的有效性。

Abstract: We present Operand Quant, a single-agent, IDE-based architecture for
autonomous machine learning engineering (MLE). Operand Quant departs from
conventional multi-agent orchestration frameworks by consolidating all MLE
lifecycle stages -- exploration, modeling, experimentation, and deployment --
within a single, context-aware agent. On the MLE-Benchmark (2025), Operand
Quant achieved a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) result, with an overall medal rate
of 0.3956 +/- 0.0565 across 75 problems -- the highest recorded performance
among all evaluated systems to date. The architecture demonstrates that a
linear, non-blocking agent, operating autonomously within a controlled IDE
environment, can outperform multi-agent and orchestrated systems under
identical constraints.
