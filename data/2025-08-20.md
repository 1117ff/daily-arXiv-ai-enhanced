### [1] [YOLO11-CR: a Lightweight Convolution-and-Attention Framework for Accurate Fatigue Driving Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13205)
*Zhebin Jin,Ligang Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了YOLO11-CR模型，一种轻量级的实时疲劣检测方案，通过卷积注意力融合模块和矩形校准模块提升了小物体和遮挡物体的检测精度，在DSM数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的疲劣检测方法存在争议：生理和车辆动力学方法虽准确但侵入性强且硬件依赖；视觉方法虽非侵入性但对小物体和遮挡物体检测效果差，多尺度特征建模能力有限。

Method: 提出YOLO11-CR模型，包含两个核心模块：1）卷积注意力融合模块(CAFM)，结合局部CNN特征和全局Transformer上下文以增强特征表达能力；2）矩形校准模块(RCM)，捕获水平和垂直上下文信息以改善空间定位能力，特别是侦测侧脸和手机等小物体。

Result: 在DSM数据集上达到了87.17%的精度、83.86%的回扫率、88.09%的mAP@50和55.93%的mAP@50-95，显著超过基线模型。消融实验证明了CAFM和RCM模块在提高敏感性和定位准确性方面的有效性。

Conclusion: YOLO11-CR提供了一种实用且高性能的车内疲劣监测解决方案，具有强大的实际部署潜力，并为未来时序建模、多模态数据集成以及嵌入式优化提供了发展空间。

Abstract: Driver fatigue detection is of paramount importance for intelligent
transportation systems due to its critical role in mitigating road traffic
accidents. While physiological and vehicle dynamics-based methods offer
accuracy, they are often intrusive, hardware-dependent, and lack robustness in
real-world environments. Vision-based techniques provide a non-intrusive and
scalable alternative, but still face challenges such as poor detection of small
or occluded objects and limited multi-scale feature modeling. To address these
issues, this paper proposes YOLO11-CR, a lightweight and efficient object
detection model tailored for real-time fatigue detection. YOLO11-CR introduces
two key modules: the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), which
integrates local CNN features with global Transformer-based context to enhance
feature expressiveness; and the Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM), which
captures horizontal and vertical contextual information to improve spatial
localization, particularly for profile faces and small objects like mobile
phones. Experiments on the DSM dataset demonstrated that YOLO11-CR achieves a
precision of 87.17%, recall of 83.86%, mAP@50 of 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 of
55.93%, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the CAFM and RCM modules in improving both
sensitivity and localization accuracy. These results demonstrate that YOLO11-CR
offers a practical and high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue
monitoring, with strong potential for real-world deployment and future
enhancements involving temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and
embedded optimization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Mirage基准测试和Mirage-R1模型，用于解决AI生成图像在真实场景中的检测问题，相比现有方法在性能上有显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI生成图像检测器在实验室环境下有效，但无法泛化到真实世界的复杂场景，这些场景中的图像包含各种噪声和编辑处理

Method: 构建Mirage基准测试（包含互联网来源和合成数据集），开发Mirage-R1视觉语言模型，采用启发式到分析式推理机制，通过两阶段训练（监督微调+强化学习）和推理时自适应思考策略

Result: 在Mirage基准和公共基准上分别领先最先进检测器5%和10%的性能

Conclusion: Mirage基准和Mirage-R1模型有效解决了真实世界AI生成图像检测的挑战，在性能和推理速度之间取得了良好平衡

Abstract: The spreading of AI-generated images (AIGI), driven by advances in generative
AI, poses a significant threat to information security and public trust.
Existing AIGI detectors, while effective against images in clean laboratory
settings, fail to generalize to in-the-wild scenarios. These real-world images
are noisy, varying from ``obviously fake" images to realistic ones derived from
multiple generative models and further edited for quality control. We address
in-the-wild AIGI detection in this paper. We introduce Mirage, a challenging
benchmark designed to emulate the complexity of in-the-wild AIGI. Mirage is
constructed from two sources: (1) a large corpus of Internet-sourced AIGI
verified by human experts, and (2) a synthesized dataset created through the
collaboration between multiple expert generators, closely simulating the
realistic AIGI in the wild. Building on this benchmark, we propose Mirage-R1, a
vision-language model with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning, a reflective
reasoning mechanism for AIGI detection. Mirage-R1 is trained in two stages: a
supervised-fine-tuning cold start, followed by a reinforcement learning stage.
By further adopting an inference-time adaptive thinking strategy, Mirage-R1 is
able to provide either a quick judgment or a more robust and accurate
conclusion, effectively balancing inference speed and performance. Extensive
experiments show that our model leads state-of-the-art detectors by 5% and 10%
on Mirage and the public benchmark, respectively. The benchmark and code will
be made publicly available.

### [3] [DianJin-OCR-R1: Enhancing OCR Capabilities via a Reasoning-and-Tool Interleaved Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13238)
*Qian Chen,Xianyin Zhang,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DianJin-OCR-R1是一个推理增强的视觉语言模型框架，通过结合自身OCR能力和专家模型工具来减少幻觉问题，在文档图像解析任务中表现优于非推理模型和专家OCR模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在OCR任务中存在幻觉问题（生成图像中不存在的文字），且相比专门训练的专家模型效果较差。需要一种方法来结合两者的优势，提高OCR准确性和减少幻觉。

Method: 提出推理增强框架DianJin-OCR-R1：1）先用自身OCR能力识别图像内容；2）调用专家模型工具获取参考结果；3）重新审视图像并重新思考推理过程，提供最终识别结果。

Result: 在ReST和OmniDocBench数据集上的实验结果表明，DianJin-OCR-R1模型持续优于非推理对应模型和专家OCR模型，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过训练推理与工具交织的视觉语言模型，结合自身OCR能力和专家模型参考，能够有效减少幻觉问题，以较低成本提升VLM在OCR任务中的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have enabled a new
paradigm of end-to-end document image parsing, excelling in Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) tasks such as text, table, and formula recognition. However,
generative LVLMs, similarly to large language models (LLMs), are prone to
hallucinations--generating words that do not exist in input images.
Furthermore, LVLMs are designed for general purposes and tend to be less
effective on OCR tasks compared to expert models that are trained on
domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we propose DianJin-OCR-R1, a
reasoning-enhanced framework designed to address these limitations through
training reasoning-and-tool interleaved VLMs. Given a recognition instruction,
our DianJin-OCR-R1 model first recognizes the content in the input image by its
own OCR capabilities, and then calls other tools (i.e., other expert models) to
obtain their results as references, finally looks again the image and rethinks
about the reasoning process to provide the final recognized content. Since
architectures of expert models are tailored for specific OCR tasks, which makes
them less prone to hallucinations, their results can help VLMs mitigate
hallucinations. Additionally, expert models are typically smaller in scale and
easy to iterate, enabling performance improvements for VLMs at a lower cost. We
evaluate our model on ReST and OmniDocBench, and experimental results show that
our DianJin-OCR-R1 models consistently outperform their non-reasoning
counterparts and expert OCR models, which proves the effectiveness of our
method.

*Sumaiya Fazal,Sheeraz Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于卷积神经网络的乌尔都语光学字符识别系统，通过组件基于分类和自动特征学习实现了高准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乌尔都语作为一种扇相书写语言，具有复杂的几何和形态结构，分割基于的识别方法往往存在高错误率问题

Method: 使用卷积神经网络进行自动特征学习，通过三个字符的排列组合生成数据集，并利用连通组件技术过滤不必要图像保留连字，构建了两层层次神经网络来处理不同程度的字符排列组合

Result: 组件分类的准确率达到了 0.99%（应为99%），显示出高效的识别性能

Conclusion: 该方法通过深度学习技术有效解决了乌尔都语识别的挑战，为曲线性文字识别提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Urdu is a cursive script language and has similarities with Arabic and many
other South Asian languages. Urdu is difficult to classify due to its complex
geometrical and morphological structure. Character classification can be
processed further if segmentation technique is efficient, but due to context
sensitivity in Urdu, segmentation-based recognition often results with high
error rate. Our proposed approach for Urdu optical character recognition system
is a component-based classification relying on automatic feature learning
technique called convolutional neural network. CNN is trained and tested on
Urdu text dataset, which is generated through permutation process of three
characters and further proceeds to discarding unnecessary images by applying
connected component technique in order to obtain ligature only. Hierarchical
neural network is implemented with two levels to deal with three degrees of
character permutations and component classification Our model successfully
achieved 0.99% for component classification.

### [5] [CLoE: Curriculum Learning on Endoscopic Images for Robust MES Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13280)
*Zeynep Ozdemir,Hacer Yalim Keles,Omer Ozgur Tanriover*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLoE是一个课程学习框架，通过图像质量评估标签可靠性并结合有序结构，提高溃疡性结肠炎内镜图像MES分类的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MES分类面临观察者间差异导致的标签噪声问题，且标准模型往往忽略评分的有序性特征。

Method: 使用轻量级模型估计图像质量作为标注置信度代理，结合ResizeMix数据增强，按样本难度从易到难进行课程学习。

Result: 在LIMUC和HyperKvasir数据集上，CLoE显著提升性能，ConvNeXt-Tiny达到82.5%准确率和0.894 QWK。

Conclusion: 难度感知训练策略能有效改善标签不确定性下的有序分类问题。

Abstract: Estimating disease severity from endoscopic images is essential in assessing
ulcerative colitis, where the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) is widely used to
grade inflammation. However, MES classification remains challenging due to
label noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the
score, which standard models often ignore. We propose CLoE, a curriculum
learning framework that accounts for both label reliability and ordinal
structure. Image quality, estimated via a lightweight model trained on Boston
Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) labels, is used as a proxy for annotation
confidence to order samples from easy (clean) to hard (noisy). This curriculum
is further combined with ResizeMix augmentation to improve robustness.
Experiments on the LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets, using both CNNs and
Transformers, show that CLoE consistently improves performance over strong
supervised and self-supervised baselines. For instance, ConvNeXt-Tiny reaches
82.5\% accuracy and a QWK of 0.894 on LIMUC with low computational cost. These
results highlight the potential of difficulty-aware training strategies for
improving ordinal classification under label uncertainty. Code will be released
at https://github.com/zeynepozdemir/CLoE.

### [6] [GaitCrafter: Diffusion Model for Biometric Preserving Gait Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13300)
*Sirshapan Mitra,Yogesh S. Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaitCrafter是一个基于扩散模型的步态序列生成框架，能够在轮廓域合成逼真的步态数据，支持多种条件控制，并能生成新身份数据以保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 步态识别面临大规模标注数据稀缺和隐私保护的挑战，需要一种能够生成多样化、高质量步态数据的方法。

Method: 训练视频扩散模型，专门处理步态轮廓数据，支持基于服装、携带物品、视角等多种条件的可控生成，并通过身份嵌入插值生成新身份。

Result: 合成样本能提升步态识别性能，特别是在挑战性条件下；生成的新身份数据具有独特且一致的步态模式，可用于模型训练同时保护真实主体隐私。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了扩散模型在高质量、可控且隐私保护的步态数据生成方面的应用价值，为步态识别领域提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Gait recognition is a valuable biometric task that enables the identification
of individuals from a distance based on their walking patterns. However, it
remains limited by the lack of large-scale labeled datasets and the difficulty
of collecting diverse gait samples for each individual while preserving
privacy. To address these challenges, we propose GaitCrafter, a diffusion-based
framework for synthesizing realistic gait sequences in the silhouette domain.
Unlike prior works that rely on simulated environments or alternative
generative models, GaitCrafter trains a video diffusion model from scratch,
exclusively on gait silhouette data. Our approach enables the generation of
temporally consistent and identity-preserving gait sequences. Moreover, the
generation process is controllable-allowing conditioning on various covariates
such as clothing, carried objects, and view angle. We show that incorporating
synthetic samples generated by GaitCrafter into the gait recognition pipeline
leads to improved performance, especially under challenging conditions.
Additionally, we introduce a mechanism to generate novel identities-synthetic
individuals not present in the original dataset-by interpolating identity
embeddings. These novel identities exhibit unique, consistent gait patterns and
are useful for training models while maintaining privacy of real subjects.
Overall, our work takes an important step toward leveraging diffusion models
for high-quality, controllable, and privacy-aware gait data generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prune2Drive是一个即插即用的视觉token剪枝框架，用于自动驾驶中的多视角视觉语言模型，通过多样性感知token选择和视图自适应剪枝控制器，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理速度和减少内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统中的多视角视觉语言模型处理高分辨率图像时会产生大量视觉token，导致计算开销巨大（自注意力机制的二次复杂度），影响推理延迟和内存使用，阻碍实际部署。

Method: 提出两种核心创新：1）受最远点采样启发的多样性感知token选择机制，优先考虑跨视图的语义和空间覆盖；2）视图自适应剪枝控制器，基于各摄像头对下游驾驶任务的重要性学习最优剪枝比例。无需模型重训练或注意力图访问。

Result: 在两个大规模多视角驾驶基准测试（DriveLM和DriveLMM-o1）上，仅保留10%视觉token时实现6.40倍预填充阶段加速，FLOPs消耗降至13.4%，性能仅下降3%。

Conclusion: Prune2Drive有效解决了多视角VLM在自动驾驶中的计算效率问题，在保持任务性能的同时显著提升推理速度和内存效率，具有实际部署价值。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm in
autonomous driving (AD), offering a unified framework for perception,
reasoning, and decision-making by jointly modeling visual inputs and natural
language instructions. However, their deployment is hindered by the significant
computational overhead incurred when processing high-resolution, multi-view
images, a standard setup in AD systems with six or more synchronized cameras.
This overhead stems from the large number of visual tokens generated during
encoding, increasing inference latency and memory consumption due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. To address these challenges, we propose
Prune2Drive, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for multi-view VLMs
in autonomous driving. Prune2Drive introduces two core innovations: (i) a
diversity-aware token selection mechanism inspired by farthest point sampling,
which prioritizes semantic and spatial coverage across views rather than
relying solely on attention scores, and (ii) a view-adaptive pruning controller
that learns optimal pruning ratios for each camera view based on their
importance to downstream driving tasks. Unlike prior methods, Prune2Drive does
not require model retraining or access to attention maps, making it compatible
with modern efficient attention implementations. Extensive experiments on two
large-scale multi-view driving benchmarks, DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1, show that
Prune2Drive achieves significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining
or improving task performance. When retaining only 10% of the visual tokens,
our method achieves a 6.40$\times$ speedup in the prefilling phase and consumes
13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only a 3% performance drop on the DriveLM
benchmark.

### [8] [DAASH: A Meta-Attack Framework for Synthesizing Effective and Stealthy Adversarial Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13309)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAASH是一个完全可微分的元攻击框架，通过策略性地组合现有的Lp范数攻击方法，生成有效且感知对齐的对抗样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Lp范数约束对抗样本往往与人类感知不一致，且不清楚Lp约束攻击的见解是否能有效提升感知效果。

Method: 多阶段框架，每阶段聚合多个基础攻击的候选对抗样本，使用学习到的自适应权重，并通过元损失函数联合最小化误分类损失和感知失真。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet上显著优于最先进的感知攻击AdvAD，攻击成功率提高20.63%，视觉质量指标(SSIM、LPIPS、FID)均有显著改善。

Conclusion: DAASH能够很好地泛化到未见过的防御方法，是评估鲁棒性的实用强基线，无需为每个新防御手工设计自适应攻击。

Abstract: Numerous techniques have been proposed for generating adversarial examples in
white-box settings under strict Lp-norm constraints. However, such norm-bounded
examples often fail to align well with human perception, and only recently have
a few methods begun specifically exploring perceptually aligned adversarial
examples. Moreover, it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained
attacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy. In this
paper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that
generates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by
strategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a
multi-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial
examples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and
propagates the result to the next stage. A novel meta-loss function guides this
process by jointly minimizing misclassification loss and perceptual distortion,
enabling the framework to dynamically modulate the contribution of each base
attack throughout the stages. We evaluate DAASH on adversarially trained models
across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Despite relying solely on
Lp-constrained based methods, DAASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
perceptual attacks such as AdvAD -- achieving higher attack success rates
(e.g., 20.63\% improvement) and superior visual quality, as measured by SSIM,
LPIPS, and FID (improvements $\approx$ of 11, 0.015, and 5.7, respectively).
Furthermore, DAASH generalizes well to unseen defenses, making it a practical
and strong baseline for evaluating robustness without requiring handcrafted
adaptive attacks for each new defense.

Method: 构建了最大的成对手术前后面部图片数据集（7,160张照片，1,259名患者），采用自动化关键点检测、几何面部对称性计算、深度学习年龄估计和鼻部形态分析的组合方法

Result: 在美容鼻手术子集中，96.2%患者至少在一个鼻部指标上显示改善，其中鼻导宽度与面部宽度比改善最为显著（77.0%）。在更广泛的面部图片组中，71.3%患者在全局面部对称性或感知年龄方面显示显著改善

Conclusion: 该框架能够提供可重复、定量的标准，为数据驱动的手术规划、患者咨询和客观效果评估提供支持，同时保证手术后患者身份识别的一致性

Abstract: We introduce a scalable, interpretable computer-vision framework for
quantifying aesthetic outcomes of facial plastic surgery using frontal
photographs. Our pipeline leverages automated landmark detection, geometric
facial symmetry computation, deep-learning-based age estimation, and nasal
morphology analysis. To perform this study, we first assemble the largest
curated dataset of paired pre- and post-operative facial images to date,
encompassing 7,160 photographs from 1,259 patients. This dataset includes a
dedicated rhinoplasty-only subset consisting of 732 images from 366 patients,
96.2% of whom showed improvement in at least one of the three nasal
measurements with statistically significant group-level change. Among these
patients, the greatest statistically significant improvements (p < 0.001)
occurred in the alar width to face width ratio (77.0%), nose length to face
height ratio (41.5%), and alar width to intercanthal ratio (39.3%). Among the
broader frontal-view cohort, comprising 989 rigorously filtered subjects, 71.3%
exhibited significant enhancements in global facial symmetry or perceived age
(p < 0.01). Importantly, our analysis shows that patient identity remains
consistent post-operatively, with True Match Rates of 99.5% and 99.6% at a
False Match Rate of 0.01% for the rhinoplasty-specific and general patient
cohorts, respectively. Additionally, we analyze inter-practitioner variability
in improvement rates. By providing reproducible, quantitative benchmarks and a
novel dataset, our pipeline facilitates data-driven surgical planning, patient
counseling, and objective outcome evaluation across practices.

Conclusion: 提示工程可以在不需要深度AI专业知识的情况下，实质性提升小型语言模型在医疗健康应用中的性能

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural
language processing and multi-modal understanding. However, their high
computational cost, limited accessibility, and data privacy concerns hinder
their adoption in resource-constrained healthcare environments. This study
investigates the performance of small language models (SLMs) in a medical
imaging classification task, comparing different models and prompt designs to
identify the optimal combination for accuracy and usability. Using the NIH
Chest X-ray dataset, we evaluate multiple SLMs on the task of classifying chest
X-ray positions (anteroposterior [AP] vs. posteroanterior [PA]) under three
prompt strategies: baseline instruction, incremental summary prompts, and
correction-based reflective prompts. Our results show that certain SLMs achieve
competitive accuracy with well-crafted prompts, suggesting that prompt
engineering can substantially enhance SLM performance in healthcare
applications without requiring deep AI expertise from end users.

learning architectures, domain adaptation techniques, pretrained models, and
domain generalization strategies to improve performance under diverse
conditions.
  This report outlines the dataset details, competition framework, evaluation
metrics, and final results, providing insights into the current state of rip
current segmentation. We conclude with a discussion of key challenges, lessons
learned from the submissions, and future directions for expanding RipSeg.

### [12] [Mitigating Easy Option Bias in Multiple-Choice Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13428)
*Hao Zhang,Chen Li,Basura Fernando*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文发现多选题视觉问答评测中存在"易选项偏差"(EOB)问题，视觉-语言模型只需看图片和选项就能猜出正确答案，无需问题信息。研究者提出了GroundAttack工具来生成难度更高的负面选项，创建了无EOB偏差的数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别多选题视觉问答评测中存在的系统性偏差问题，这种偏差让模型可以不依赖问题内容就能选出正确答案，影响了对模型真实能力的评估。

Method: 通过基础实验归因了EOB问题的根源＊正确答案与图片内容在特征空间中的对齐度更高。提出了GroundAttack工具包，自动生成视觉上与正确答案同样可信的难以区分的负面选项。

Result: 在新创建的EOB-free注释数据上，当仅使用图片和选项(V+O)时，当前VLMs的准确率接近随机水平；在使用全部信息(V+Q+O)时，模型准确率也下降到未饼和的水平，提供了更现实的能力评估。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了现有VQA评测中存在的系统性偏差问题，并提供了一种有效的解决方案。通过GroundAttack生成的难以区分的负面选项，可以创建更加可靠的评测环境，促进VLMs真正理解问题内容而非依赖短路机制。

Abstract: In this early study, we observe an Easy-Options Bias (EOB) issue in some
multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks such as MMStar,
RealWorldQA, SEED-Bench, Next-QA, STAR benchmark and Video-MME. This bias
allows vision-language models (VLMs) to select the correct answer using only
the vision (V) and options (O) as inputs, without the need for the question
(Q). Through grounding experiments, we attribute the bias to an imbalance in
visual relevance: the correct answer typically aligns more closely with the
visual contents than the negative options in feature space, creating a shortcut
for VLMs to infer the answer via simply vision-option similarity matching. To
fix this, we introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically generates
hard negative options as visually plausible as the correct answer. We apply it
to the NExT-QA and MMStar datasets, creating new EOB-free annotations. On these
EOB-free annotations, current VLMs approach to random accuracies under (V+O)
settings, and drop to non-saturated accuracies under (V+Q+O) settings,
providing a more realistic evaluation of VLMs' QA ability. Codes and new
annotations will be released soon.

Abstract: Comprehensive highway scene understanding and robust traffic risk inference
are vital for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and
generalization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of
real-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
structured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables
automatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual
risk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy
to produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as
knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much
smaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision
for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding
low-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware
captions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves
strong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR,
ROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This
demonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent
supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning
capabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient
deployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without
requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades.

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了面部特征解耦和跨模态共享的问题，为可控说话头生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Achieving disentangled control over multiple facial motions and accommodating
diverse input modalities greatly enhances the application and entertainment of
the talking head generation. This necessitates a deep exploration of the
decoupling space for facial features, ensuring that they a) operate
independently without mutual interference and b) can be preserved to share with
different modal inputs, both aspects often neglected in existing methods. To
address this gap, this paper proposes EDTalk++, a novel full disentanglement
framework for controllable talking head generation. Our framework enables
individual manipulation of mouth shape, head pose, eye movement, and emotional
expression, conditioned on video or audio inputs. Specifically, we employ four
lightweight modules to decompose the facial dynamics into four distinct latent
spaces representing mouth, pose, eye, and expression, respectively. Each space
is characterized by a set of learnable bases whose linear combinations define
specific motions. To ensure independence and accelerate training, we enforce
orthogonality among bases and devise an efficient training strategy to allocate
motion responsibilities to each space without relying on external knowledge.
The learned bases are then stored in corresponding banks, enabling shared
visual priors with audio input. Furthermore, considering the properties of each
space, we propose an Audio-to-Motion module for audio-driven talking head
synthesis. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of
EDTalk++.

Abstract: Kidney stone classification from endoscopic images is critical for
personalized treatment and recurrence prevention. While convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) have shown promise in this task, their limited ability to
capture long-range dependencies can hinder performance under variable imaging
conditions. This study presents a comparative analysis between Vision
Transformers (ViTs) and CNN-based models, evaluating their performance on two
ex vivo datasets comprising CCD camera and flexible ureteroscope images. The
ViT-base model pretrained on ImageNet-21k consistently outperformed a ResNet50
baseline across multiple imaging conditions. For instance, in the most visually
complex subset (Section patches from endoscopic images), the ViT model achieved
95.2% accuracy and 95.1% F1-score, compared to 64.5% and 59.3% with ResNet50.
In the mixed-view subset from CCD-camera images, ViT reached 87.1% accuracy
versus 78.4% with CNN. These improvements extend across precision and recall as
well. The results demonstrate that ViT-based architectures provide superior
classification performance and offer a scalable alternative to conventional
CNNs for kidney stone image analysis.

TL;DR: MINR通过共享中间层来高效编码多张图像，在保持性能的同时减少60%参数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的隐式神经表示(INR)为每张图像使用单独的MLP，导致编码多张图像时计算和存储效率低下

Method: 分析训练好的INR层间权重分布，发现中间层分布模式高度相似，因此共享中间层而保留输入输出层为图像特定，并为每张图像设计额外的投影层来捕获独特特征

Result: 在图像重建和超分辨率任务中，MINR节省60%参数的同时保持可比性能，可扩展到处理100张图像，平均PSNR达34dB

Conclusion: MINR方法有效解决了多图像INR编码的效率问题，具有鲁棒性和可扩展性

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) aim to parameterize discrete signals
through implicit continuous functions. However, formulating each image with a
separate neural network~(typically, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)) leads to
computational and storage inefficiencies when encoding multi-images. To address
this issue, we propose MINR, sharing specific layers to encode multi-image
efficiently. We first compare the layer-wise weight distributions for several
trained INRs and find that corresponding intermediate layers follow highly
similar distribution patterns. Motivated by this, we share these intermediate
layers across multiple images while preserving the input and output layers as
input-specific. In addition, we design an extra novel projection layer for each
image to capture its unique features. Experimental results on image
reconstruction and super-resolution tasks demonstrate that MINR can save up to
60\% parameters while maintaining comparable performance. Particularly, MINR
scales effectively to handle 100 images, maintaining an average peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 34 dB. Further analysis of various backbones
proves the robustness of the proposed MINR.

TL;DR: DHQ是一种针对隐式神经表示(INRs)的分布感知哈达玛量化方案，同时对权重和激活值进行量化，通过哈达玛变换将不同分布统一为钟形分布，显著提升硬件效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的INR量化方法主要关注权重量化，缺乏激活值量化，硬件节省有限。INRs中不同层的权重和激活值分布差异显著，需要统一的量化方案来充分利用量化带来的硬件优势。

Method: 提出DHQ方案，利用哈达玛变换将不同层的权重和激活值的多样化分布标准化为统一的钟形分布，然后应用标准量化器。该方法得到实证和理论分析的支持。

Result: 在多种图像重建任务上的实验表明，DHQ相比全精度版本，延迟降低32.7%，能耗降低40.1%，资源利用率最高提升98.3%，优于之前的量化方法。

Conclusion: DHQ通过分布感知的哈达玛量化有效解决了INRs中权重和激活值的量化问题，显著提升了硬件效率，为INRs的实际部署提供了可行的量化解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals using
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with complex activation functions. While INRs
achieve superior performance, they depend on full-precision number
representation for accurate computation, resulting in significant hardware
overhead. Previous INR quantization approaches have primarily focused on weight
quantization, offering only limited hardware savings due to the lack of
activation quantization. To fully exploit the hardware benefits of
quantization, we propose DHQ, a novel distribution-aware Hadamard quantization
scheme that targets both weights and activations in INRs. Our analysis shows
that the weights in the first and last layers have distributions distinct from
those in the intermediate layers, while the activations in the last layer
differ significantly from those in the preceding layers. Instead of customizing
quantizers individually, we utilize the Hadamard transformation to standardize
these diverse distributions into a unified bell-shaped form, supported by both
empirical evidence and theoretical analysis, before applying a standard
quantizer. To demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach, we present
an FPGA implementation of DHQ that highlights its hardware efficiency.
Experiments on diverse image reconstruction tasks show that DHQ outperforms
previous quantization methods, reducing latency by 32.7\%, energy consumption
by 40.1\%, and resource utilization by up to 98.3\% compared to full-precision
counterparts.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals in a
continuous manner using neural networks, demonstrating significant value across
various multimedia applications. However, the vulnerability of INRs presents a
critical challenge for their real-world deployments, as the network weights
might be subjected to unavoidable perturbations. In this work, we investigate
the robustness of INRs for the first time and find that even minor
perturbations can lead to substantial performance degradation in the quality of
signal reconstruction. To mitigate this issue, we formulate the robustness
problem in INRs by minimizing the difference between loss with and without
weight perturbations. Furthermore, we derive a novel robust loss function to
regulate the gradient of the reconstruction loss with respect to weights,
thereby enhancing the robustness. Extensive experiments on reconstruction tasks
across multiple modalities demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 7.5~dB
improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values compared to original
INRs under noisy conditions.

Conclusion: FAMNet通过2D/3D CNN融合和多任务学习机制，能够有效提取微表情的全方位特征，显著提高了微表情识别的性能，为解决该领域的挑战提供了有效方案

Abstract: Micro-expressions recognition (MER) has essential application value in many
fields, but the short duration and low intensity of micro-expressions (MEs)
bring considerable challenges to MER. The current MER methods in deep learning
mainly include three data loading methods: static images, dynamic image
sequence, and a combination of the two streams. How to effectively extract MEs'
fine-grained and spatiotemporal features has been difficult to solve. This
paper proposes a new MER method based on multi-task learning and hierarchical
attention, which fully extracts MEs' omni-directional features by merging 2D
and 3D CNNs. The fusion model consists of a 2D CNN AMNet2D and a 3D CNN
AMNet3D, with similar structures consisting of a shared backbone network
Resnet18 and attention modules. During training, the model adopts different
data loading methods to adapt to two specific networks respectively, jointly
trains on the tasks of MER and facial action unit detection (FAUD), and adopts
the parameter hard sharing for information association, which further improves
the effect of the MER task, and the final fused model is called FAMNet.
Extensive experimental results show that our proposed FAMNet significantly
improves task performance. On the SAMM, CASME II and MMEW datasets, FAMNet
achieves 83.75% (UAR) and 84.03% (UF1). Furthermore, on the challenging
CAS(ME)$^3$ dataset, FAMNet achieves 51% (UAR) and 43.42% (UF1).

Abstract: 4D radar-based object detection has garnered great attention for its
robustness in adverse weather conditions and capacity to deliver rich spatial
information across diverse driving scenarios. Nevertheless, the sparse and
noisy nature of 4D radar point clouds poses substantial challenges for
effective perception. To address the limitation, we present CORENet, a novel
cross-modal denoising framework that leverages LiDAR supervision to identify
noise patterns and extract discriminative features from raw 4D radar data.
Designed as a plug-and-play architecture, our solution enables seamless
integration into voxel-based detection frameworks without modifying existing
pipelines. Notably, the proposed method only utilizes LiDAR data for
cross-modal supervision during training while maintaining full radar-only
operation during inference. Extensive evaluation on the challenging Dual-Radar
dataset, which is characterized by elevated noise level, demonstrates the
effectiveness of our framework in enhancing detection robustness. Comprehensive

Conclusion: BDCL框架通过双层解耦和一致性学习有效提升了多视图聚类的性能，增强了特征的簇间区分性和簇内紧凑性

Abstract: Multi-view clustering has shown to be an effective method for analyzing
underlying patterns in multi-view data. The performance of clustering can be
improved by learning the consistency and complementarity between multi-view
features, however, cluster-oriented representation learning is often
overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel Bi-level Decoupling and
Consistency Learning framework (BDCL) to further explore the effective
representation for multi-view data to enhance inter-cluster discriminability
and intra-cluster compactness of features in multi-view clustering. Our
framework comprises three modules: 1) The multi-view instance learning module
aligns the consistent information while preserving the private features between
views through reconstruction autoencoder and contrastive learning. 2) The
bi-level decoupling of features and clusters enhances the discriminability of
feature space and cluster space. 3) The consistency learning module treats the
different views of the sample and their neighbors as positive pairs, learns the
consistency of their clustering assignments, and further compresses the
intra-cluster space. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the SOTA
methods. Our code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/BDCL.

Motivation: 现有HDR技术忽视了快门速度与ISO的复杂交互作用，且没有考虑动态场景中的运动模糊效应，影响了HDR成像质量

Method: 提出AdaptiveAE方法，采用强化学习优化快门速度和ISO组合选择，集成了包含运动模糊和噪声模拟的图像合成流程，利用语义信息和曝光直方图

Result: 在多个数据集上进行实验，证明该方法能够适应性选择最优的ISO和快门速度序列，达到了目前最好的性能水平

Conclusion: AdaptiveAE能够根据用户定义的曝光时间预算自动选择曝光策略，比传统方案更好地平衡噪声和运动模糊问题，提高动态场景HDR重建质量

Abstract: Mainstream high dynamic range imaging techniques typically rely on fusing
multiple images captured with different exposure setups (shutter speed and
ISO). A good balance between shutter speed and ISO is crucial for achieving
high-quality HDR, as high ISO values introduce significant noise, while long
shutter speeds can lead to noticeable motion blur. However, existing methods
often overlook the complex interaction between shutter speed and ISO and fail
to account for motion blur effects in dynamic scenes.
  In this work, we propose AdaptiveAE, a reinforcement learning-based method
that optimizes the selection of shutter speed and ISO combinations to maximize
HDR reconstruction quality in dynamic environments. AdaptiveAE integrates an
image synthesis pipeline that incorporates motion blur and noise simulation
into our training procedure, leveraging semantic information and exposure
histograms. It can adaptively select optimal ISO and shutter speed sequences
based on a user-defined exposure time budget, and find a better exposure
schedule than traditional solutions. Experimental results across multiple
datasets demonstrate that it achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Badminton is known as one of the fastest racket sports in the world. Despite
doubles matches being more prevalent in international tournaments than singles,
previous research has mainly focused on singles due to the challenges in data
availability and multi-person tracking. To address this gap, we designed an
approach that transfers singles-trained models to doubles analysis. We
extracted keypoints from the ShuttleSet single matches dataset using ViT-Pose
and embedded them through a contrastive learning framework based on ST-GCN. To
improve tracking stability, we incorporated a custom multi-object tracking
algorithm that resolves ID switching issues from fast and overlapping player
movements. A Transformer-based classifier then determines shot occurrences
based on the learned embeddings. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of
extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton, broadening
analytics capabilities. This work establishes a foundation for doubles-specific
datasets to enhance understanding of this predominant yet understudied format
of the fast racket sport.

TL;DR: VGQ是一种新型图像tokenizer，通过2D高斯分布增强结构建模，显著提升重建质量，在ImageNet 256x256上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于量化的tokenizer（如VQ-GAN）主要关注纹理和颜色等外观特征，忽略了几何结构信息，导致结构化视觉信息建模能力不足。

Method: 提出Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ)框架，将2D高斯分布集成到传统视觉码本量化框架中，通过直接建模位置、旋转和尺度等结构相关参数来编码图像潜在表示。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256基准测试中，VGQ达到rFID 1.00的重建质量；通过增加2D高斯密度，进一步提升到rFID 0.556和PSNR 24.93的SOTA性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VGQ通过引入2D高斯分布显式增强结构建模，在token效率和视觉丰富性之间提供了灵活权衡，为图像生成中的tokenizer设计提供了新范式。

Abstract: The image tokenizer is a critical component in AR image generation, as it
determines how rich and structured visual content is encoded into compact
representations. Existing quantization-based tokenizers such as VQ-GAN
primarily focus on appearance features like texture and color, often neglecting
geometric structures due to their patch-based design. In this work, we explored
how to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a
new framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer
paradigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D
Gaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks. Our
approach addresses the inherent limitations of naive quantization methods such
as VQ-GAN, which struggle to model structured visual information due to their
patch-based design and emphasis on texture and color. In contrast, VGQ encodes
image latents as 2D Gaussian distributions, effectively capturing geometric and
spatial structures by directly modeling structure-related parameters such as
position, rotation and scale. We further demonstrate that increasing the
density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in
reconstruction fidelity, providing a flexible trade-off between token
efficiency and visual richness. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VGQ achieves
strong reconstruction quality with an rFID score of 1.00. Furthermore, by
increasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens, VGQ gains a
significant boost in reconstruction capability and achieves a state-of-the-art
reconstruction rFID score of 0.556 and a PSNR of 24.93, substantially
outperforming existing methods. Codes will be released soon.

TL;DR: 基于视觉基础模型特征的几何形状分析，提出了一种分布检查框架，通过跨领域转移几何知识来应对聚合学习和长尾分布中的数据异质性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习中训练样本与真实分布存在距离，正在基础模型时代，发现视觉基础模型特征的几何形状具有跨领域转移性，可用于解决数据异质性问题

Method: 构建几何知识导向的分布检查框架：在聚合学习中设计技术获取全局几何形状，并生成新样本缩小本地与全局观测间距离；在长尾识别中利用样本丰富类别的几何知识来恢复尾部类别的真实分布

Result: 综合实验表明，该方法能够有效克服数据异质性和样本不平衡导致的信息缺失问题，在各个基准测试中都实现了性能提升

Conclusion: 通过利用视觉基础模型特征的几何形状转移性，提出的分布检查框架为解决深度学习中的数据异质性问题提供了有效的新方法

Abstract: Despite the fast progress of deep learning, one standing challenge is the gap
of the observed training samples and the underlying true distribution. There
are multiple reasons for the causing of this gap e.g. sampling bias, noise etc.
In the era of foundation models, we show that when leveraging the off-the-shelf
(vision) foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2) for feature extraction, the
geometric shapes of the resulting feature distributions exhibit remarkable
transferability across domains and datasets. To verify its practical
usefulness, we embody our geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
framework in two popular and challenging settings: federated learning and
long-tailed recognition. In the federated setting, we devise a technique of
acquiring the global geometric shape under privacy constraints, then leverage
this knowledge to generate new samples for clients, in the aim of bridging the
gap between local and global observations. In long-tailed learning, it utilizes
the geometric knowledge transferred from sample-rich categories to recover the
true distribution for sample-scarce tail classes. Comprehensive experiments
show that our proposed geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
effectively overcomes information deficits caused by data heterogeneity and
sample imbalance, with boosted performance across benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面部情绪识别在人际交互和心理健康诊断中至关重要，但现有视觉语言模型在低质量噪声数据上的表现尚未得到系统评估，需要探索VLMs在此类任务中的实际适用性。

Method: 提出新颖的流程，整合GFPGAN图像修复技术与FER评估，在FER-2013数据集（35,887张低分辨率灰度图像，7种情绪类别）上对比Phi-3.5 Vision、CLIP等VLMs与VGG19、ResNet-50、EfficientNet-B0等传统模型。

Result: 传统模型表现显著优于VLMs：EfficientNet-B0准确率86.44%，ResNet-50达85.72%，而CLIP仅64.07%，Phi-3.5 Vision仅51.66%。同时提供了包含预处理、训练、推理和评估阶段的详细计算成本分析。

Conclusion: VLMs在低质量视觉任务中存在明显局限性，需要针对噪声环境进行适配优化。本研究为情绪识别领域的未来研究提供了可复现的基准，并强调了实际部署中的实用考量。

Abstract: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is crucial for applications such as
human-computer interaction and mental health diagnostics. This study presents
the first empirical comparison of open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
including Phi-3.5 Vision and CLIP, against traditional deep learning models
VGG19, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet-B0 on the challenging FER-2013 dataset,
which contains 35,887 low-resolution grayscale images across seven emotion
classes. To address the mismatch between VLM training assumptions and the noisy
nature of FER data, we introduce a novel pipeline that integrates GFPGAN-based
image restoration with FER evaluation. Results show that traditional models,
particularly EfficientNet-B0 (86.44%) and ResNet-50 (85.72%), significantly
outperform VLMs like CLIP (64.07%) and Phi-3.5 Vision (51.66%), highlighting
the limitations of VLMs in low-quality visual tasks. In addition to performance
evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, we provide a
detailed computational cost analysis covering preprocessing, training,
inference, and evaluation phases, offering practical insights for deployment.
This work underscores the need for adapting VLMs to noisy environments and
provides a reproducible benchmark for future research in emotion recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS基础方法在高保真头部虚拟人重建中存在细层面部表情捕捉困难和局部纹理连续性不足的问题

Method: 提出稀疏表情控制机制，用少量关键高斯控制周围高斯的变形；利用预训组3D生成模型提供面部几何前矢，改善训练稳定性和形状准确性

Result: 实验结果显示方法能够生成更准确、视觉一致的头部重建结果，提升了表情可控性和细节保真度

Conclusion: EAvatar框架通过表情感知和变形感知设计，有效解决了3DGS基础头部虚拟人重建中的细层表情捕捉和纹理连续性挑战

Abstract: High-fidelity head avatar reconstruction plays a crucial role in AR/VR,
gaming, and multimedia content creation. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated effectiveness in modeling complex geometry
with real-time rendering capability and are now widely used in high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction tasks. However, existing 3DGS-based methods still
face significant challenges in capturing fine-grained facial expressions and
preserving local texture continuity, especially in highly deformable regions.
To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS-based framework termed
EAvatar for head reconstruction that is both expression-aware and
deformation-aware. Our method introduces a sparse expression control mechanism,
where a small number of key Gaussians are used to influence the deformation of
their neighboring Gaussians, enabling accurate modeling of local deformations
and fine-scale texture transitions. Furthermore, we leverage high-quality 3D
priors from pretrained generative models to provide a more reliable facial
geometry, offering structural guidance that improves convergence stability and
shape accuracy during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method produces more accurate and visually coherent head reconstructions with
improved expression controllability and detail fidelity.

TL;DR: FLAIR提出了一种频率和局部性感知的隐式神经表示方法，通过RC-GAUSS激活函数和WEGE编码机制解决现有INRs缺乏频率选择性和空间局部性的问题，在2D图像表示/修复和3D重建任务中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐式神经表示(INRs)缺乏频率选择性、空间局部性和稀疏表示，过度依赖冗余信号分量，存在频谱偏差问题，难以捕捉高频细节

Method: 提出FLAIR方法，包含两个关键创新：1) RC-GAUSS激活函数，在时频不确定性原理约束下实现显式频率选择和空间局部化；2) 小波能量引导编码(WEGE)，利用离散小波变换计算能量分数，显式指导频率信息到网络

Result: 方法在2D图像表示和修复、3D重建任务中持续优于现有INRs

Conclusion: FLAIR通过频率选择和空间局部化机制有效解决了INRs的频谱偏差问题，提升了高频细节的捕捉能力

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) leverage neural networks to map
coordinates to corresponding signals, enabling continuous and compact
representations. This paradigm has driven significant advances in various
vision tasks. However, existing INRs lack frequency selectivity, spatial
localization, and sparse representations, leading to an over-reliance on
redundant signal components. Consequently, they exhibit spectral bias, tending
to learn low-frequency components early while struggling to capture fine
high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose FLAIR (Frequency-
and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations), which incorporates two key
innovations. The first is RC-GAUSS, a novel activation designed for explicit
frequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the
time-frequency uncertainty principle (TFUP). The second is
Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding (WEGE), which leverages the discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to compute energy scores and explicitly guide frequency
information to the network. Our method consistently outperforms existing INRs
in 2D image representation and restoration, as well as 3D reconstruction.

Motivation: 现有的注视点渲染技术需要昂贵的硬件眼动追踪系统，存在成本高、校准复杂和硬件兼容性限制等问题，限制了其广泛应用

Method: 采用球形视觉变换器处理360度VR场景，结合LSTM时序编码器捕捉注视序列模式，通过多模态融合网络整合空间场景特征和时序注视动态来预测未来注视位置

Result: 在综合VR数据集上实现3.83度中值角度误差，比传统显著性基线方法提升24%，提供可靠的置信度校准，在不同空间区域和场景类型中保持稳定性能

Conclusion: 纯软件注视预测可用于VR注视点渲染，使性能提升更易于在不同VR平台和应用中部署，无需额外硬件要求

Abstract: Foveated rendering significantly reduces computational demands in virtual
reality applications by concentrating rendering quality where users focus their
gaze. Current approaches require expensive hardware-based eye tracking systems,
limiting widespread adoption due to cost, calibration complexity, and hardware
compatibility constraints. This paper presents GazeProphet, a software-only
approach for predicting gaze locations in VR environments without requiring
dedicated eye tracking hardware. The approach combines a Spherical Vision
Transformer for processing 360-degree VR scenes with an LSTM-based temporal
encoder that captures gaze sequence patterns. A multi-modal fusion network
integrates spatial scene features with temporal gaze dynamics to predict future
gaze locations with associated confidence estimates. Experimental evaluation on
a comprehensive VR dataset demonstrates that GazeProphet achieves a median
angular error of 3.83 degrees, outperforming traditional saliency-based
baselines by 24% while providing reliable confidence calibration. The approach
maintains consistent performance across different spatial regions and scene
types, enabling practical deployment in VR systems without additional hardware
requirements. Statistical analysis confirms the significance of improvements
across all evaluation metrics. These results show that software-only gaze
prediction can work for VR foveated rendering, making this performance boost
more accessible to different VR platforms and apps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式人脸视频编码（GFVC）虽然在码率-头真性能方面表现优异，但大型模型参数和高计算成本阻碍了其实际部署。

Method: 提出双模式优化方案：结构方面用更薄、更高效的层替换传统3x3卷积；操作方面采用两阶段适配性通道剪枝策略，包括训练期的软剪枝和训练后的硬剪枝。

Result: 实验结果显示，方案实现了90.4%的参数缩减和88.9%的计算节省，同时在感知质量指标上超过最新视频编码标准VVC。

Conclusion: 该轻量化方案有望在资源受限的环境（如移动边缘设备）中实现高效的GFVC部署。

Abstract: Generative Face Video Coding (GFVC) achieves superior rate-distortion
performance by leveraging the strong inference capabilities of deep generative
models. However, its practical deployment is hindered by large model parameters
and high computational costs. To address this, we propose a lightweight GFVC
framework that introduces dual-mode optimization -- combining architectural
redesign and operational refinement -- to reduce complexity whilst preserving
reconstruction quality. Architecturally, we replace traditional 3 x 3
convolutions with slimmer and more efficient layers, reducing complexity
without compromising feature expressiveness. Operationally, we develop a
two-stage adaptive channel pruning strategy: (1) soft pruning during training
identifies redundant channels via learnable thresholds, and (2) hard pruning
permanently eliminates these channels post-training using a derived mask. This
dual-phase approach ensures both training stability and inference efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight dual-mode
optimization for GFVC can achieve 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9%
computation saving compared to the baseline, whilst achieving superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video
Coding (VVC) in terms of perceptual-level quality metrics. As such, the
proposed method is expected to enable efficient GFVC deployment in
resource-constrained environments such as mobile edge devices.

Method: 提出类神经元编码方法，基于生物神经元内在工作原理生成脉冲数据，并加入人工光感受器层使脉冲数据携带颜色和亮度信息。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法有效增加了脉冲信号的信息含量并提升了SNN性能，同时遵循神经形态计算原则。

Conclusion: 这种生物启发方法具有很强的发展潜力，可能有助于克服神经形态计算的当前限制，促进SNN的更广泛应用。

Abstract: In recent years, neuromorphic computing and spiking neural networks (SNNs)
have ad-vanced rapidly through integration with deep learning. However, the
performance of SNNs still lags behind that of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), primarily due to the limited information capacity of spike-based data.
Although some studies have attempted to improve SNN performance by training
them with non-spiking inputs such as static images, this approach deviates from
the original intent of neuromorphic computing, which emphasizes spike-based
information processing. To address this issue, we propose a Neuron-like
Encoding method that generates spike data based on the intrinsic operational
principles and functions of biological neurons. This method is further enhanced
by the incorporation of an artificial pho-toreceptor layer, enabling spike data
to carry both color and luminance information, thereby forming a complete
visual spike signal. Experimental results using the Integrate-and-Fire neuron
model demonstrate that this biologically inspired approach effectively
increases the information content of spike signals and improves SNN
performance, all while adhering to neuromorphic principles. We believe this
concept holds strong potential for future development and may contribute to
overcoming current limitations in neuro-morphic computing, facilitating broader
applications of SNNs.

Result: 在7个工业和医学数据集上的广泛实验表明，DictAS持续优于最先进的少样本异常分割方法

Conclusion: 该方法通过自监督字典查找机制成功实现了无需重新训练的跨类别异常检测，为少样本异常分割提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Recent vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have demonstrated remarkable
class-generalizable ability to unseen classes in few-shot anomaly segmentation
(FSAS), leveraging supervised prompt learning or fine-tuning on seen classes.
However, their cross-category generalization largely depends on prior knowledge
of real seen anomaly samples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
namely DictAS, which enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in
unseen object categories without any retraining on the target data, only
employing a few normal reference images as visual prompts. The insight behind
DictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for
unseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the
normal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically,
DictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) **Dictionary Construction** -
to simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from
normal reference images. (2) **Dictionary Lookup** - to retrieve queried region
features from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature
cannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly. (3) **Query Discrimination
Regularization**- to enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features
harder to retrieve from the dictionary. To achieve this, Contrastive Query
Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint are further proposed. Extensive
experiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that
DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods.

Motivation: SMPLify在3D人体姿态和形状估计中作为鲁棒基线，但其迭代优化过程计算成本高，限制了实用性。受其他领域用神经网络替代迭代优化的启发，希望开发更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出可学习的SMPLify框架，采用时序采样策略构建初始化-目标对进行训练，使用人体中心归一化方案和残差学习来缩小解空间，支持序列推理和插件式后处理。

Conclusion: Learnable SMPLify建立了一个实用且简单的基线，显著提高了3D人体姿态估计的效率，同时保持了准确性。

Abstract: In 3D human pose and shape estimation, SMPLify remains a robust baseline that
solves inverse kinematics (IK) through iterative optimization. However, its
high computational cost limits its practicality. Recent advances across domains
have shown that replacing iterative optimization with data-driven neural
networks can achieve significant runtime improvements without sacrificing
accuracy. Motivated by this trend, we propose Learnable SMPLify, a neural
framework that replaces the iterative fitting process in SMPLify with a
single-pass regression model. The design of our framework targets two core
challenges in neural IK: data construction and generalization. To enable
effective training, we propose a temporal sampling strategy that constructs
initialization-target pairs from sequential frames. To improve generalization
across diverse motions and unseen poses, we propose a human-centric
normalization scheme and residual learning to narrow the solution space.
Learnable SMPLify supports both sequential inference and plug-in
post-processing to refine existing image-based estimators. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method establishes itself as a practical and
simple baseline: it achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify,
generalizes well to unseen 3DPW and RICH, and operates in a model-agnostic
manner when used as a plug-in tool on LucidAction. The code is available at

Abstract: Video action analysis is a foundational technology within the realm of
intelligent video comprehension, particularly concerning its application in
Internet of Things(IoT). However, existing methodologies overlook feature
semantics in feature extraction and focus on optimizing action proposals, thus
these solutions are unsuitable for widespread adoption in high-performance IoT
applications due to the limitations in precision, such as autonomous driving,
which necessitate robust and scalable intelligent video analytics analysis. To
address this issue, we propose a novel generative attention-based model to
learn the relation of feature semantics. Specifically, by leveraging the
differences of actions' foreground and background, our model simultaneously
learns the frame- and segment-dependencies of temporal action feature
semantics, which takes advantage of feature semantics in the feature extraction
effectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive
experiments on two benchmark video task, action recognition and action
detection. In the context of action detection tasks, we substantiate the
superiority of our approach through comprehensive validation on widely
recognized datasets. Moreover, we extend the validation of the effectiveness of
our proposed method to a broader task, video action recognition. Our code is

Result: 在四个公开RVOS测试集上均达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 通过重构分割头设计、利用深度学习特征提取以及新的时序上下文模块，可以显著提升引用视频对象分割的准确性和边界分割质量。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment specific objects
in a video according to textual descriptions. We observe that recent RVOS
approaches often place excessive emphasis on feature extraction and temporal
modeling, while relatively neglecting the design of the segmentation head. In
fact, there remains considerable room for improvement in segmentation head
design. To address this, we propose a Temporal-Conditional Referring Video
Object Segmentation model, which innovatively integrates existing segmentation
methods to effectively enhance boundary segmentation capability. Furthermore,
our model leverages a text-to-video diffusion model for feature extraction. On
top of this, we remove the traditional noise prediction module to avoid the
randomness of noise from degrading segmentation accuracy, thereby simplifying
the model while improving performance. Finally, to overcome the limited feature
extraction capability of the VAE, we design a Temporal Context Mask Refinement
(TCMR) module, which significantly improves segmentation quality without
introducing complex designs. We evaluate our method on four public RVOS

*Yoel Shapiro,Yahia Showgan,Koustav Mullick*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的领域适应管道，通过将晴朗天气图像转换为雾、雨、雪和夜间图像来生成恶劣天气数据，解决了自动驾驶系统在恶劣环境下性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统在恶劣环境条件下（如低光照和降水）性能显著下降，而现有数据集中恶劣条件的代表性不足，获取和标注恶劣天气数据的成本过高。

Method: 开发了多种数据生成管道，包括纯模拟、基于GAN和混合扩散-GAN方法，利用现有DA GAN并扩展支持辅助输入，结合模拟和真实图像进行训练，并引入自适应混合方法来减少幻觉和伪影。

Result: 在ACDC数据集上，语义分割整体性能提升1.85%，夜间条件下提升4.62%，证明了混合方法在恶劣条件下提升自动驾驶感知鲁棒性的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的混合数据生成方法能够有效生成逼真的恶劣天气图像，显著提升下游模型在恶劣环境条件下的性能，为解决自动驾驶系统在恶劣天气下的性能问题提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems exhibit markedly degraded performance under
adverse environmental conditions, such as low illumination and precipitation.
The underrepresentation of adverse conditions in AD datasets makes it
challenging to address this deficiency. To circumvent the prohibitive cost of
acquiring and annotating adverse weather data, we propose a novel Domain
Adaptation (DA) pipeline that transforms clear-weather images into fog, rain,
snow, and nighttime images. Here, we systematically develop and evaluate
several novel data-generation pipelines, including simulation-only, GAN-based,
and hybrid diffusion-GAN approaches, to synthesize photorealistic adverse
images from labelled clear images. We leverage an existing DA GAN, extend it to
support auxiliary inputs, and develop a novel training recipe that leverages
both simulated and real images. The simulated images facilitate exact
supervision by providing perfectly matched image pairs, while the real images
help bridge the simulation-to-real (sim2real) gap. We further introduce a
method to mitigate hallucinations and artifacts in Stable-Diffusion
Image-to-Image (img2img) outputs by blending them adaptively with their
progenitor images. We finetune downstream models on our synthetic data and
evaluate them on the Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences (ACDC). We
achieve 1.85 percent overall improvement in semantic segmentation, and 4.62
percent on nighttime, demonstrating the efficacy of our hybrid method for
robust AD perception under challenging conditions.

*Jinyoung Park,Minseok Son,Changick Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaMe是一种专门为基于状态空间模型(SSM)的视觉模型设计的token合并策略，通过利用状态转移参数Δ量化token重要性并保持序列信息流，在保持性能的同时显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态空间模型在计算机视觉中表现出强大能力，但计算效率仍需提升。现有的token缩减方法应用于SSM时需要特别考虑其独特的序列建模特性。

Method: 提出MaMe策略：1) 使用状态转移参数Δ作为信息量度量指标来量化token重要性；2) 引入战略性token排列来保持序列信息流；3) 适用于微调模型和现成模型。

Result: 实验表明MaMe在效率-性能权衡方面表现优异，即使在激进的token缩减情况下也能保持鲁棒性。在图像分类、视频和音频等多个领域都展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MaMe为SSM在各种应用中的效率提升提供了一种有效方法，解决了token重要性量化和序列特性保持两个关键挑战。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful architectures in computer
vision, yet improving their computational efficiency remains crucial for
practical and scalable deployment.While token reduction serves as an effective
approach for model efficiency, applying it to SSMs requires careful
consideration of their unique sequential modeling capabilities.In this work, we
propose MaMe, a token-merging strategy tailored for SSM-based vision
models.MaMe addresses two key challenges: quantifying token importance and
preserving sequential properties. Our approach leverages the state transition
parameter $\mathbf{\Delta}$ as an informativeness measure and introduces
strategic token arrangements to preserve sequential information flow.Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MaMe achieves superior efficiency-performance
trade-offs for both fine-tuned and off-the-shelf models. Particularly, our
approach maintains robustness even under aggressive token reduction where
existing methods undergo significant performance degradation.Beyond image
classification, MaMe shows strong generalization capabilities across video and
audio domains, establishing an effective approach for enhancing efficiency in
diverse SSM applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于双重解耦设计的FoundationSSC框架，通过基础编码器提供语义和几何先验知识，使用专门化的解耦途径进行精炼，并通过新的轴向感知融合模块实现特征融合，在语义和几何指标上都获得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的相机基3D语义场景完成方法依赖耦合编码器来传递语义和几何先验知识，这强刻模型在冲突需求之间做出折衷，限制了整体性能。

Method: 提出FoundationSSC框架，进行源级别和途径级别的双重解耦：源级别使用基础编码器提供语义特征和立体成本体积；途径级别通过专门化的解耦途径精炼先验知识；使用混合视图变换生成补充的3D特征；引入新的轴向感知融合模块进行各异性融合。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI上超越之前最佳继续提升+0.23 mIoU和+2.03 IoU，在SSCBench-KITTI-360上达到21.78 mIoU和48.61 IoU的独创性能。

Conclusion: 双重解耦设计能够有效地解决语义和几何先验知识的冲突问题，为3D语义场景完成任务提供了更优称的解决方案，在多个数据集上都取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) provides dense geometric and
semantic perception for autonomous driving and robotic navigation. However,
existing methods rely on a coupled encoder to deliver both semantic and
geometric priors, which forces the model to make a trade-off between
conflicting demands and limits its overall performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FoundationSSC, a novel framework that performs dual
decoupling at both the source and pathway levels. At the source level, we
introduce a foundation encoder that provides rich semantic feature priors for
the semantic branch and high-fidelity stereo cost volumes for the geometric
branch. At the pathway level, these priors are refined through specialised,
decoupled pathways, yielding superior semantic context and depth distributions.
Our dual-decoupling design produces disentangled and refined inputs, which are
then utilised by a hybrid view transformation to generate complementary 3D
features. Additionally, we introduce a novel Axis-Aware Fusion (AAF) module
that addresses the often-overlooked challenge of fusing these features by
anisotropically merging them into a unified representation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the advantages of FoundationSSC, achieving simultaneous
improvements in both semantic and geometric metrics, surpassing prior bests by
+0.23 mIoU and +2.03 IoU on SemanticKITTI. Additionally, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance on SSCBench-KITTI-360, with 21.78 mIoU and 48.61
IoU. The code will be released upon acceptance.

*Tianyi Niu,Jaemin Cho,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs在图像旋转识别任务上表现不佳，特别是无法可靠区分90°和270°旋转，揭示了多模态大语言模型在空间推理能力方面与人类感知存在显著差距


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）识别图像旋转方向的能力，评估其在视觉空间推理方面的表现

Method: 构建RotBench基准数据集（350张图像），测试包括GPT-5、o3、Gemini-2.5-Pro等先进MLLMs在0°、90°、180°、270°四种旋转角度下的识别性能，并尝试使用辅助信息、思维链提示、多角度同时显示等策略

Result: 大多数模型能可靠识别0°正立图像，部分能识别180°倒立图像，但都无法可靠区分90°和270°旋转。辅助信息和提示策略仅带来有限改进，微调也无法改善90°/270°区分能力

Conclusion: MLLMs在图像旋转识别任务上存在显著缺陷，特别是在区分90°和270°旋转方面，表明其空间推理能力远不及人类感知水平

Abstract: We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can
accurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0{\deg}, 90{\deg},
180{\deg}, and 270{\deg}. This task demands robust visual reasoning
capabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships
within images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these
abilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark
comprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively
simple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and
proprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably
identify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information
-- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought
prompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate
that most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\deg}) images,
while certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\deg}) images. None
can reliably distinguish between 90{\deg} and 270{\deg}. Simultaneously showing
the image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains
for reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the
performance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve
models' ability to distinguish 90{\deg} and 270{\deg} rotations, despite
substantially improving the identification of 180{\deg} images. Together, these
results reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities
and human perception in identifying rotation.

Abstract: With the growing demand for short videos and personalized content, automated
Video Log (Vlog) generation has become a key direction in multimodal content
creation. Existing methods mostly rely on predefined scripts, lacking dynamism
and personal expression. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an automated
Vlog generation approach that enables effective multimodal collaboration and
high personalization. To this end, we propose PersonaVlog, an automated
multimodal stylized Vlog generation framework that can produce personalized
Vlogs featuring videos, background music, and inner monologue speech based on a
given theme and reference image. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent
collaboration framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This
framework efficiently generates high-quality prompts for multimodal content
creation based on user input, thereby improving the efficiency and creativity
of the process. In addition, we incorporate a feedback and rollback mechanism
that leverages MLLMs to evaluate and provide feedback on generated results,
thereby enabling iterative self-correction of multimodal content. We also
propose ThemeVlogEval, a theme-based automated benchmarking framework that
provides standardized metrics and datasets for fair evaluation. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the significant advantages and potential of our
framework over several baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and great
potential for generating automated Vlogs.

Abstract: Face mask detection has become increasingly important recently, particularly
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many face detection models have been developed in
smart entryways using IoT. However, there is a lack of IoT development on face
mask detection. This paper proposes a two-factor authentication system for
smart entryway access control using facial recognition and passcode
verification and an automation process to alert the owner and activate the
surveillance system when a stranger is detected and controls the system
remotely via Telegram on a Raspberry Pi platform. The system employs the Local
Binary Patterns Histograms for the full face recognition algorithm and modified
LBPH algorithm for occluded face detection. On average, the system achieved an
Accuracy of approximately 70%, a Precision of approximately 80%, and a Recall
of approximately 83.26% across all tested users. The results indicate that the
system is capable of conducting face recognition and mask detection, automating
the operation of the remote control to register users, locking or unlocking the
door, and notifying the owner. The sample participants highly accept it for
future use in the user acceptance test.

Motivation: 现有音频驱动说话头合成模型在人类多样性（种族、语言、年龄）方面缺乏泛化能力，这主要是由于训练数据在规模、质量和多样性方面的局限性。

Method: 通过多阶段自动化流水线精心筛选运动稳定性、美学质量和面部细节，构建TalkVid数据集，并创建分层评估集TalkVid-Bench，确保数据可靠性和平衡性。

Result: 在TalkVid上训练的模型优于先前数据集训练的模型，表现出更好的跨数据集泛化能力，同时TalkVid-Bench揭示了传统聚合指标掩盖的性能差异。

Conclusion: TalkVid数据集和TalkVid-Bench评估集为解决音频驱动说话头合成中的多样性泛化问题提供了重要资源，强调了平衡评估的必要性。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head synthesis has achieved remarkable photorealism, yet
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models exhibit a critical failure: they lack
generalization to the full spectrum of human diversity in ethnicity, language,
and age groups. We argue that this generalization gap is a direct symptom of
limitations in existing training data, which lack the necessary scale, quality,
and diversity. To address this challenge, we introduce TalkVid, a new
large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset containing 1244 hours of video
from 7729 unique speakers. TalkVid is curated through a principled, multi-stage
automated pipeline that rigorously filters for motion stability, aesthetic
quality, and facial detail, and is validated against human judgments to ensure
its reliability. Furthermore, we construct and release TalkVid-Bench, a
stratified evaluation set of 500 clips meticulously balanced across key
demographic and linguistic axes. Our experiments demonstrate that a model
trained on TalkVid outperforms counterparts trained on previous datasets,
exhibiting superior cross-dataset generalization. Crucially, our analysis on
TalkVid-Bench reveals performance disparities across subgroups that are
obscured by traditional aggregate metrics, underscoring its necessity for
future research. Code and data can be found in

Motivation: 解决当前RGB-D方法在缺乏深度信息场景中的挑战，提供一种仅依赖RGB图像的高精度姿势估计方案

Method: 设计转换器基础的神经网络预测和融合目标物体的几何特征，使用几何特征导向算法确保特征的几何保真性，最终通过RANSAC-PnP算法计算姿势

Result: 在标准数据集上达到了高效率和超过以往RGB基础方法的优异精度

Conclusion: 该方法为仅使用RGB图像进行类别级物体姿势估计提供了新的视角和解决方案

Abstract: While most current RGB-D-based category-level object pose estimation methods
achieve strong performance, they face significant challenges in scenes lacking
depth information. In this paper, we propose a novel category-level object pose
estimation approach that relies solely on RGB images. This method enables
accurate pose estimation in real-world scenarios without the need for depth
data. Specifically, we design a transformer-based neural network for
category-level object pose estimation, where the transformer is employed to
predict and fuse the geometric features of the target object. To ensure that
these predicted geometric features faithfully capture the object's geometry, we
introduce a geometric feature-guided algorithm, which enhances the network's
ability to effectively represent the object's geometric information. Finally,
we utilize the RANSAC-PnP algorithm to compute the object's pose, addressing
the challenges associated with variable object scales in pose estimation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach is not
only highly efficient but also achieves superior accuracy compared to previous
RGB-based methods. These promising results offer a new perspective for
advancing category-level object pose estimation using RGB images.

Motivation: 扩散模型在条件生成中对引导权重高度敏感，作者发现这是由于训练和推理阶段存在差距导致的，这种差距影响了生成质量

Method: 提出DiffIER方法，在推理阶段通过迭代误差最小化来减少累积误差，采用基于优化的plug-and-play框架

Result: 方法在条件生成任务中优于基线方法，在文本到图像生成、图像超分辨率和文本到语音生成等多个领域都取得了成功

Conclusion: DiffIER方法有效解决了训练-推理差距问题，提高了生成质量，具有广泛的适用性和应用潜力

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality samples and enhancing performance across diverse domains through
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, the quality of generated samples is
highly sensitive to the selection of the guidance weight. In this work, we
identify a critical ``training-inference gap'' and we argue that it is the
presence of this gap that undermines the performance of conditional generation
and renders outputs highly sensitive to the guidance weight. We quantify this
gap by measuring the accumulated error during the inference stage and establish
a correlation between the selection of guidance weight and minimizing this gap.
Furthermore, to mitigate this gap, we propose DiffIER, an optimization-based
method for high-quality generation. We demonstrate that the accumulated error
can be effectively reduced by an iterative error minimization at each step
during inference. By introducing this novel plug-and-play optimization
framework, we enable the optimization of errors at every single inference step
and enhance generation quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed
method outperforms baseline approaches in conditional generation tasks.
Furthermore, the method achieves consistent success in text-to-image
generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation, underscoring
its versatility and potential for broad applications in future research.

Conclusion: OmniTry成功扩展了虚拟试穿的应用范围，解决了多品类可穿戴物品试穿的数据挑战，为实际应用提供了有效的无掩码解决方案。

Abstract: Virtual Try-ON (VTON) is a practical and widely-applied task, for which most
of existing works focus on clothes. This paper presents OmniTry, a unified
framework that extends VTON beyond garment to encompass any wearable objects,
e.g., jewelries and accessories, with mask-free setting for more practical
application. When extending to various types of objects, data curation is
challenging for obtaining paired images, i.e., the object image and the
corresponding try-on result. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-staged
pipeline: For the first stage, we leverage large-scale unpaired images, i.e.,
portraits with any wearable items, to train the model for mask-free
localization. Specifically, we repurpose the inpainting model to automatically
draw objects in suitable positions given an empty mask. For the second stage,
the model is further fine-tuned with paired images to transfer the consistency
of object appearance. We observed that the model after the first stage shows
quick convergence even with few paired samples. OmniTry is evaluated on a
comprehensive benchmark consisting of 12 common classes of wearable objects,
with both in-shop and in-the-wild images. Experimental results suggest that
OmniTry shows better performance on both object localization and
ID-preservation compared with existing methods. The code, model weights, and
evaluation benchmark of OmniTry will be made publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在局限性：基于分割的方法在矢量化后处理中难以保持拓扑保真度；图增长方法计算成本高；图生成方法限制了顶点的动态插入。需要一种既能保持拓扑保真度又具有高效推理速度的方法。

Conclusion: DeH4R成功解决了道路网络提取中的关键挑战，实现了拓扑保真度和计算效率的平衡，为地理空间计算机视觉领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The automated extraction of complete and precise road network graphs from
remote sensing imagery remains a critical challenge in geospatial computer
vision. Segmentation-based approaches, while effective in pixel-level
recognition, struggle to maintain topology fidelity after vectorization
postprocessing. Graph-growing methods build more topologically faithful graphs
but suffer from computationally prohibitive iterative ROI cropping.
Graph-generating methods first predict global static candidate road network
vertices, and then infer possible edges between vertices. They achieve fast
topology-aware inference, but limits the dynamic insertion of vertices. To
address these challenges, we propose DeH4R, a novel hybrid model that combines
graph-generating efficiency and graph-growing dynamics. This is achieved by
decoupling the task into candidate vertex detection, adjacent vertex
prediction, initial graph contruction, and graph expansion. This architectural
innovation enables dynamic vertex (edge) insertions while retaining fast
inference speed and enhancing both topology fidelity and spatial consistency.
Comprehensive evaluations on CityScale and SpaceNet benchmarks demonstrate
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. DeH4R outperforms the prior SOTA
graph-growing method RNGDet++ by 4.62 APLS and 10.18 IoU on CityScale, while
being approximately 10 $\times$ faster. The code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/7777777FAN/DeH4R.

Motivation: 随着多模态模型的快速发展，追求人工通用智能需要模型在多样化环境中达到人类可比性能，但现有基准测试经常忽视人类相关视觉上下文理解的关键技能

Method: 提出HumanPCR评估套件，包含三个层次：Human-P（感知）、Human-C（理解）和Human-R（推理）。前两者包含6000+人工验证多选题，评估9个维度的任务；后者提供手动策划的视频推理测试，需要整合多个视觉证据和主动提取上下文

Result: 对30+最先进模型的广泛评估显示，在人类中心视觉理解方面存在显著挑战，特别是在详细空间感知、时间理解和心智建模任务中。模型在从多样化人类场景中提取主动视觉证据方面表现挣扎，过度依赖查询引导检索

Abstract: The aspiration for artificial general intelligence, fueled by the rapid
progress of multimodal models, demands human-comparable performance across
diverse environments. We propose HumanPCR, an evaluation suite for probing
MLLMs' capacity about human-related visual contexts across three hierarchical
levels: Perception, Comprehension, and Reasoning (denoted by Human-P, Human-C,
and Human-R, respectively). Human-P and Human-C feature over 6,000
human-verified multiple choice questions, assessing massive tasks of 9
dimensions, including but not limited to essential skills frequently overlooked
by existing benchmarks. Human-R offers a challenging manually curated video
reasoning test that requires integrating multiple visual evidences, proactively
extracting context beyond question cues, and applying human-like expertise.
Each question includes human-annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales with
key visual evidence to support further research. Extensive evaluations on over
30 state-of-the-art models exhibit significant challenges in human-centric
visual understanding, particularly in tasks involving detailed space
perception, temporal understanding, and mind modeling. Moreover, analysis of
Human-R reveals the struggle of models in extracting essential proactive visual
evidence from diverse human scenes and their faulty reliance on query-guided
retrieval. Even with advanced techniques like scaling visual contexts and
test-time thinking yield only limited benefits. We hope HumanPCR and our
findings will advance the development, evaluation, and human-centric
application of multimodal models.

burden by leveraging unlabeled data to generate pseudo labels. Recently,
advanced state space models, represented by Mamba, have shown efficient
handling of long-range dependencies. This drives us to explore their potential
in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a
novel Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba framework (namely DCMamba) for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation, which explores and utilizes the
diversity from data, network, and feature perspectives. Firstly, from the data
perspective, we develop patch-level weak-strong mixing augmentation with
Mamba's scanning modeling characteristics. Moreover, from the network
perspective, we introduce a diverse-scan collaboration module, which could
benefit from the prediction discrepancies arising from different scanning
directions. Furthermore, from the feature perspective, we adopt an
uncertainty-weighted contrastive learning mechanism to enhance the diversity of
feature representation. Experiments demonstrate that our DCMamba significantly
outperforms other semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods, e.g.,
yielding the latest SSM-based method by 6.69% on the Synapse dataset with 20%
labeled data.

*Ali Abdari,Alex Falcon,Giuseppe Serra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于视觉-语言模型的层次化方法，用于表征和检索农业主题的虚拟博物馆，解决教育内容在Metaverse中的组织和搜索问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线教育内容浓度增长，特别是农业领域。Metaverse提供了互动沉浸式学习环境，但相关场景的搜索仍然面临挑战，现有数据集过小不适合训练高级模型。

Method: 首先构建了包含457个农业主题虚拟博物馆(AgriMuseums)的新数据集，每个都有文本描述。然后提出了一种层次化的视觉-语言模型，用于使用自然语言查询来表征和检索相关的AgriMuseums。

Result: 在实验设置中，提出的方法达到了约62% R@1和78% MRR的性能，证明了其有效性。同时在现有基准上实现了最多6% R@1和11% MRR的收益。

Conclusion: 该研究为Metaverse中教育内容的组织和搜索提供了有效解决方案，通过新的数据集和层次化视觉-语言模型，显著提升了虚拟博物馆的表征和检索性能。

Abstract: Every day, a large amount of educational content is uploaded online across
different areas, including agriculture and gardening. When these videos or
materials are grouped meaningfully, they can make learning easier and more
effective. One promising way to organize and enrich such content is through the
Metaverse, which allows users to explore educational experiences in an
interactive and immersive environment. However, searching for relevant
Metaverse scenarios and finding those matching users' interests remains a
challenging task. A first step in this direction has been done recently, but
existing datasets are small and not sufficient for training advanced models. In
this work, we make two main contributions: first, we introduce a new dataset
containing 457 agricultural-themed virtual museums (AgriMuseums), each enriched
with textual descriptions; and second, we propose a hierarchical
vision-language model to represent and retrieve relevant AgriMuseums using
natural language queries. In our experimental setting, the proposed method
achieves up to about 62\% R@1 and 78\% MRR, confirming its effectiveness, and
it also leads to improvements on existing benchmarks by up to 6\% R@1 and 11\%
MRR. Moreover, an extensive evaluation validates our design choices. Code and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了IPGA攻击方法，通过利用投影器模块的中间阶段进行精细化的视觉-语言模型攻击，解决了现有方法在精细程度攻击方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的目标攻击方法通过批动图像来最大化全局相似性，将丰富的视觉语义压缩成单个全局向量，限制了攻击的精细程度，并且忽视了投影器模块这个关键的语义桥梁。

Method: 提出IPGA攻击方法，利用投影器模块（特别是Q-Former）的中间阶段，将全局图像嵌入转换为精细化的视觉特征，让攻击在语义有意义的视觉标记上进行。同时提出殊异查询对齐（RQA）来保持无关的视觉内容。

Result: 实验结果显示，IPGA在标准全局图像描述任务和精细化视觉问答任务中均超过现有方法，并成功转移到多个商业VLM模型上。

Conclusion: IPGA通过注意投影器模块的中间表征，实现了更精细和有效的视觉-语言模型目标攻击，为VLM安全性评估提供了新方法。

Abstract: Targeted adversarial attacks are essential for proactively identifying
security flaws in Vision-Language Models before real-world deployment. However,
current methods perturb images to maximize global similarity with the target
text or reference image at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics
into a single global vector. This limits attack granularity, hindering
fine-grained manipulations such as modifying a car while preserving its
background. Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a
critical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in
VLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline
within VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to
attack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the
widely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into
fine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over
adversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens
rather than a single global representation. Specifically, IPGA leverages the
Q-Former pretrained solely on the first vision-language alignment stage,
without LLM fine-tuning, which improves both attack effectiveness and
transferability across diverse VLMs. Furthermore, we propose Residual Query
Alignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content, thereby yielding more
controlled and precise adversarial manipulations. Extensive experiments show
that our attack method consistently outperforms existing methods in both
standard global image captioning tasks and fine-grained visual
question-answering tasks in black-box environment. Additionally, IPGA
successfully transfers to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini and
OpenAI GPT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCUS是一种无需训练的解码策略，通过顺序掩码图像来缓解多图像输入时的信息泄漏问题，显著提升多图像推理性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在单图像任务上表现良好，但在处理多图像输入时性能显著下降，因为不同图像的视觉线索在模型输出中相互干扰，出现跨图像信息泄漏现象

Method: 提出FOCUS解码策略：1）顺序用随机噪声掩码除一张图像外的所有图像；2）重复此过程获取部分掩码上下文下的logits；3）聚合logits并使用纯噪声参考输入进行对比精炼

Result: FOCUS在四个多图像基准测试和多种LVLM模型家族中一致提升性能

Conclusion: FOCUS提供了一种通用且实用的解决方案，无需额外训练或架构修改即可增强多图像推理能力

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong performance on
single-image tasks. However, we observe that their performance degrades
significantly when handling multi-image inputs. This occurs because visual cues
from different images become entangled in the model's output. We refer to this
phenomenon as cross-image information leakage. To address this issue, we
propose FOCUS, a training-free and architecture-agnostic decoding strategy that
mitigates cross-image information leakage during inference. FOCUS sequentially
masks all but one image with random noise, guiding the model to focus on the
single clean image. We repeat this process across all target images to obtain
logits under partially masked contexts. These logits are aggregated and then
contrastively refined using a noise-only reference input, which suppresses the
leakage and yields more accurate outputs. FOCUS consistently improves
performance across four multi-image benchmarks and diverse LVLM families. This
demonstrates that FOCUS offers a general and practical solution for enhancing
multi-image reasoning without additional training or architectural
modifications.

TL;DR: MR6D是一个专为移动机器人设计的6D位姿估计数据集，针对工业环境中大型物体、远距离视角和复杂遮挡等挑战，填补了现有数据集主要关注小型家用物体的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有6D位姿估计数据集主要针对机器人臂操作的小型家用物体，无法满足移动机器人在工业环境中面对大型物体、远距离感知、严重自遮挡和多样化相机视角的需求。

Method: 构建包含92个真实场景、16个独特物体的MR6D数据集，涵盖静态和动态交互场景，捕捉移动平台特有的远距离视角、多样化物体配置、大型物体尺寸和复杂遮挡模式。

Result: 初步实验显示当前6D位姿估计方法在这些场景下表现不佳，2D分割成为另一个技术瓶颈。

Conclusion: MR6D为开发和评估面向移动机器人需求的位姿估计方法奠定了基础，填补了该领域的数据空白。

Abstract: Existing 6D pose estimation datasets primarily focus on small household
objects typically handled by robot arm manipulators, limiting their relevance
to mobile robotics. Mobile platforms often operate without manipulators,
interact with larger objects, and face challenges such as long-range
perception, heavy self-occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives. While recent
models generalize well to unseen objects, evaluations remain confined to
household-like settings that overlook these factors. We introduce MR6D, a
dataset designed for 6D pose estimation for mobile robots in industrial
environments. It includes 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects
across static and dynamic interactions. MR6D captures the challenges specific
to mobile platforms, including distant viewpoints, varied object
configurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion
patterns. Initial experiments reveal that current 6D pipelines underperform in
these settings, with 2D segmentation being another hurdle. MR6D establishes a
foundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to
the demands of mobile robotics. The dataset is available at

Motivation: 将三维形状注册到二维关键点的问题在单相机情况下已经得到广泛研究，但多相机系统为医学成像和手持相机注册等应用领域带来了新的可能性。研究者希望利用多视图之间的相互约束来提高重建精度。

Method: 研究者提出了三种不同的方法：1）基于知道三维空间点的方向向量方法；2）基于未知三维点但知道方向的方法；3）结合边缘信息的方法。使用幻想相机模型来表示多相机系统，对应方法采用了投凸规划和迭代精化等技术。

Conclusion: 这些方法构成了首套解决基于幻想相机的形状模板重建问题的方案，为医学成像和计算机视觉领域的应用提供了新的技术支持。

Abstract: This article presents a new method for non-rigidly registering a 3D shape to
2D keypoints observed by a constellation of multiple cameras. Non-rigid
registration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template
(SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information
from multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of
known use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and
registration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such
multi-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection
of perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be
registered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach
where the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D
point in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a
direction vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation
w.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from
correspondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,
these form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised
cameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved
reconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the
additional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a
deformed object. The correspondence-based approaches are solved with convex
programming while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of
the results from the convex solutions. We demonstrate the accuracy of our
proposed methods on many synthetic and real data

TL;DR: VisionLaw是一个双层优化框架，通过LLMs驱动的解耦本构演化策略和视觉引导的本构评估机制，从视觉观察中推断可解释的内在动力学表达式


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推断物体内在动力学时面临两大挑战：基于手动定义本构先验的方法难以泛化到复杂场景，而基于神经网络的方法可解释性差且泛化能力有限

Method: 上层使用LLMs作为物理专家生成和修订本构定律，内置解耦机制降低搜索复杂度；下层通过视觉模拟评估生成的本构定律与内在动力学的一致性

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，VisionLaw能有效从视觉观察中推断可解释的内在动力学，显著优于现有最先进方法，并在新场景中表现出强大的泛化能力

Conclusion: VisionLaw框架成功解决了内在动力学推断中的可解释性和泛化性问题，为物理交互模拟提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: The intrinsic dynamics of an object governs its physical behavior in the real
world, playing a critical role in enabling physically plausible interactive
simulation with 3D assets. Existing methods have attempted to infer the
intrinsic dynamics of objects from visual observations, but generally face two
major challenges: one line of work relies on manually defined constitutive
priors, making it difficult to generalize to complex scenarios; the other
models intrinsic dynamics using neural networks, resulting in limited
interpretability and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionLaw, a bilevel optimization framework that infers interpretable
expressions of intrinsic dynamics from visual observations. At the upper level,
we introduce an LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution strategy, where
LLMs are prompted as a knowledgeable physics expert to generate and revise
constitutive laws, with a built-in decoupling mechanism that substantially
reduces the search complexity of LLMs. At the lower level, we introduce a
vision-guided constitutive evaluation mechanism, which utilizes visual
simulation to evaluate the consistency between the generated constitutive law
and the underlying intrinsic dynamics, thereby guiding the upper-level
evolution. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that VisionLaw can effectively infer interpretable intrinsic dynamics from
visual observations. It significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods and exhibits strong generalization for interactive simulation in novel
scenarios.

Motivation: 提高乳腺癌超声分割的准确性和可解释性，通过整合临床文本信息来增强模型的可信度和透明度，为计算机辅助诊断提供临床依据的解释。

Method: 采用双分支视觉编码器（ViT+Swin Transformer）和不确定性感知融合，使用BioClinicalBERT编码BI-RADS语义的临床语言，通过跨模态注意力结合视觉特征，同时生成分割掩码、不确定性图和诊断理由。

Result: 在BUS-BRA数据集上达到Dice 99%和IoU 95%，超越U-Net、ViT和Swin等基线方法，多模态对齐CLIP得分85%，置信度校准ECE 3.2%。

Conclusion: Med-CTX为可信赖的多模态医学架构设立了新标准，临床文本在分割准确性和解释质量中起关键作用，能够同时提供精确的分割结果和临床可解释的诊断理由。

Abstract: We introduce Med-CTX, a fully transformer based multimodal framework for
explainable breast cancer ultrasound segmentation. We integrate clinical
radiology reports to boost both performance and interpretability. Med-CTX
achieves exact lesion delineation by using a dual-branch visual encoder that
combines ViT and Swin transformers, as well as uncertainty aware fusion.
Clinical language structured with BI-RADS semantics is encoded by
BioClinicalBERT and combined with visual features utilising cross-modal
attention, allowing the model to provide clinically grounded, model generated
explanations. Our methodology generates segmentation masks, uncertainty maps,
and diagnostic rationales all at once, increasing confidence and transparency
in computer assisted diagnosis. On the BUS-BRA dataset, Med-CTX achieves a Dice
score of 99% and an IoU of 95%, beating existing baselines U-Net, ViT, and
Swin. Clinical text plays a key role in segmentation accuracy and explanation
quality, as evidenced by ablation studies that show a -5.4% decline in Dice
score and -31% in CIDEr. Med-CTX achieves good multimodal alignment (CLIP
score: 85%) and increased confi dence calibration (ECE: 3.2%), setting a new

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对脉冲神经网络的时序压缩攻击(TCA)框架，通过时间步级反向传播和对抗性膜电位重用技术，显著减少了攻击延迟达56.6%，同时保持相似的攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于梯度的SNN对抗攻击方法存在严重的攻击延迟问题，这些方法直接扩展ANN范式，未能充分利用SNN的关键特性，导致多时间步处理带来的延迟使其无法满足实时应用需求。

Method: TCA框架包含两个核心组件：1) 时间步级反向传播(TLBP) - 基于发现全局时序信息对攻击成功并非关键，支持逐时间步评估和早期停止；2) 对抗性膜电位重用(A-MPR) - 通过预计算和重用初始时间步的膜电位累积阶段，避免重复计算。

Result: 在VGG-11和ResNet-17模型上使用CIFAR-10/100和CIFAR10-DVS数据集的实验表明，TCA在白盒和黑盒设置下分别减少了56.6%和57.1%的攻击延迟，同时保持了可比的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: TCA框架通过有效利用SNN的时序特性，显著降低了对抗攻击的计算延迟，为SNN在实时应用中的安全部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based adversarial attacks on spiking neural
networks (SNNs), which largely rely on extending FGSM and PGD frameworks, face
a critical limitation: substantial attack latency from multi-timestep
processing, rendering them infeasible for practical real-time applications.
This inefficiency stems from their design as direct extensions of ANN
paradigms, which fail to exploit key SNN properties. In this paper, we propose
the timestep-compressed attack (TCA), a novel framework that significantly
reduces attack latency. TCA introduces two components founded on key insights
into SNN behavior. First, timestep-level backpropagation (TLBP) is based on our
finding that global temporal information in backpropagation to generate
perturbations is not critical for an attack's success, enabling per-timestep
evaluation for early stopping. Second, adversarial membrane potential reuse
(A-MPR) is motivated by the observation that initial timesteps are
inefficiently spent accumulating membrane potential, a warm-up phase that can
be pre-calculated and reused. Our experiments on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with the
CIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets show that TCA significantly reduces the
required attack latency by up to 56.6% and 57.1% compared to SOTA methods in
white-box and black-box settings, respectively, while maintaining a comparable
attack success rate.

Motivation: 城市树木生物多样性对气候适应和生态稳定至关重要，但传统采集方法成本高、耗时，而监督AI方法需要标签数据且跨区域逆逆性差。

Method: 提出一种无监督聚类框架，结合街道级别图像的视觉嵌入和空间植装模式，在不需要标签数据的情况下估算生物多样性。

Result: 在8个北美城市进行测试，方法能够高保真度地恢复属级生物多样性模式，对Shannon和Simpson指数获得低Wasserstein距离，并保持空间自相关性。

Conclusion: 该可扩展、细粒度方法为缺乏详细监测数据的城市提供了生物多样性地图制作能力，支持连续、低成本监测和城市生态系统的适应性管理。

Abstract: Urban tree biodiversity is critical for climate resilience, ecological
stability, and livability in cities, yet most municipalities lack detailed
knowledge of their canopies. Field-based inventories provide reliable estimates
of Shannon and Simpson diversity but are costly and time-consuming, while
supervised AI methods require labeled data that often fail to generalize across
regions. We introduce an unsupervised clustering framework that integrates
visual embeddings from street-level imagery with spatial planting patterns to
estimate biodiversity without labels. Applied to eight North American cities,
the method recovers genus-level diversity patterns with high fidelity,
achieving low Wasserstein distances to ground truth for Shannon and Simpson
indices and preserving spatial autocorrelation. This scalable, fine-grained
approach enables biodiversity mapping in cities lacking detailed inventories
and offers a pathway for continuous, low-cost monitoring to support equitable
access to greenery and adaptive management of urban ecosystems.

Abstract: Achieving top-notch performance in Intelligent Transportation detection is a
critical research area. However, many challenges still need to be addressed
when it comes to detecting in a cross-domain scenario. In this paper, we
propose a Self-Aware Adaptive Alignment (SA3), by leveraging an efficient
alignment mechanism and recognition strategy. Our proposed method employs a
specified attention-based alignment module trained on source and target domain
datasets to guide the image-level features alignment process, enabling the
local-global adaptive alignment between the source domain and target domain.
Features from both domains, whose channel importance is re-weighted, are fed
into the region proposal network, which facilitates the acquisition of salient
region features. Also, we introduce an instance-to-image level alignment module
specific to the target domain to adaptively mitigate the domain gap. To
evaluate the proposed method, extensive experiments have been conducted on
popular cross-domain object detection benchmarks. Experimental results show
that SA3 achieves superior results to the previous state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该方法无需训练、可无缝集成到现有扩散和流匹配架构，支持额外条件如边框以提升空间对齐，为文本到图像生成提供了更准确的控制能力

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models produce visually impressive results but
often struggle with precise alignment to text prompts, leading to missing
critical elements or unintended blending of distinct concepts. We propose a
novel approach that learns a high-success-rate distribution conditioned on a
target prompt, ensuring that generated images faithfully reflect the
corresponding prompts. Our method explicitly models the signal component during
the denoising process, offering fine-grained control that mitigates
over-optimization and out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, our framework is
training-free and seamlessly integrates with both existing diffusion and flow
matching architectures. It also supports additional conditioning modalities --
such as bounding boxes -- for enhanced spatial alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. The

Abstract: The Id-Pattern system within the RED.AI project (Reabilita\c{c}\~ao
Estrutural Digital atrav\'es da AI) consists of an agentic system designed to
assist in the identification of stone deterioration patterns. Traditional
methodologies, based on direct observation by expert teams, are accurate but
costly in terms of time and resources. The system developed here introduces and
evaluates a multi-agent artificial intelligence (AI) system, designed to
simulate collaboration between experts and automate the diagnosis of stone
pathologies from visual evidence. The approach is based on a cognitive
architecture that orchestrates a team of specialized AI agents which, in this
specific case, are limited to five: a lithologist, a pathologist, an
environmental expert, a conservator-restorer, and a diagnostic coordinator. To
evaluate the system we selected 28 difficult images involving multiple
deterioration patterns. Our first results showed a huge boost on all metrics of
our system compared to the foundational model.

Motivation: 现有增量学习评估多依赖简化的合成基准，无法反映真实世界性能，需要建立更现实的评估基准。

Method: 构建了两个真实增量目标检测基准：D-RICO（固定类别集但存在域偏移）和EC-RICO（每步增加新域和类别），基于14个多样化数据集，涵盖真实和合成域、不同条件、相机传感器等。

Result: 所有增量学习方法在适应性和知识保留方面表现不佳，重放少量旧数据就能超越所有方法，但单独训练仍是最优的。

Conclusion: 增量学习方法存在明显性能差距，归因于蒸馏中的弱教师、单模型无法处理多样化任务以及可塑性不足等问题。

Abstract: Incremental Learning (IL) trains models sequentially on new data without full
retraining, offering privacy, efficiency, and scalability. IL must balance
adaptability to new data with retention of old knowledge. However, evaluations
often rely on synthetic, simplified benchmarks, obscuring real-world IL
performance. To address this, we introduce two Realistic Incremental Object
Detection Benchmarks (RICO): Domain RICO (D-RICO) features domain shifts with a
fixed class set, and Expanding-Classes RICO (EC-RICO) integrates new domains
and classes per IL step. Built from 14 diverse datasets covering real and
synthetic domains, varying conditions (e.g., weather, time of day), camera
sensors, perspectives, and labeling policies, both benchmarks capture
challenges absent in existing evaluations. Our experiments show that all IL
methods underperform in adaptability and retention, while replaying a small
amount of previous data already outperforms all methods. However, individual
training on the data remains superior. We heuristically attribute this gap to
weak teachers in distillation, single models' inability to manage diverse
tasks, and insufficient plasticity. Our code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: LCRReg是一种新的正则化方法，利用潜在概念表示（如CAVs）引导医学影像深度学习模型学习临床相关特征而非虚假相关性，提高分布偏移下的泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像深度学习模型在分布偏移下泛化能力差，经常依赖虚假相关性而非临床有意义特征，需要一种无需密集概念标注的方法来提升模型鲁棒性

Method: 使用小型辅助数据集合成高质量解耦概念示例，提取预定义相关特征的LCRs，通过正则化项引导CNN在相关概念潜在子空间激活

Result: 在合成和真实医学任务中验证有效：在玩具数据集上显著提升对虚假相关性的鲁棒性；在糖尿病视网膜病变分类中，在合成扰动和OOD泛化下性能均优于基线方法

Conclusion: LCRReg提供了一种轻量级、架构无关的策略，无需密集概念监督即可提升模型鲁棒性，优于多任务学习、线性探测和后处理概念模型

Abstract: Deep learning models in medical imaging often achieve strong in-distribution
performance but struggle to generalise under distribution shifts, frequently
relying on spurious correlations instead of clinically meaningful features. We
introduce LCRReg, a novel regularisation approach that leverages Latent Concept
Representations (LCRs) (e.g., Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)) to guide
models toward semantically grounded representations. LCRReg requires no concept
labels in the main training set and instead uses a small auxiliary dataset to
synthesise high-quality, disentangled concept examples. We extract LCRs for
predefined relevant features, and incorporate a regularisation term that guides
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to activate within latent subspaces
associated with those concepts. We evaluate LCRReg across synthetic and
real-world medical tasks. On a controlled toy dataset, it significantly
improves robustness to injected spurious correlations and remains effective
even in multi-concept and multiclass settings. On the diabetic retinopathy
binary classification task, LCRReg enhances performance under both synthetic
spurious perturbations and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation. Compared
to baselines, including multitask learning, linear probing, and post-hoc
concept-based models, LCRReg offers a lightweight, architecture-agnostic
strategy for improving model robustness without requiring dense concept
supervision. Code is available at the following link:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 南亚霞霉事件对社会经济造成重大影响，但缺乏区域规模的实时预测系统，需要发展有效的氟胶指数预测方法

Method: 采用Sentinel-5P空气成分数据(2019-2023)，建立卷积长短期记忆网络(ConvLSTM)模型，以紫外氟胶指数(340-380nm)作为预测因子

Result: 模型能在五天间隔预测氟胶指数，平均方差错误约0.0018，损失值约0.3995，结构相似性指数约0.74

Conclusion: ConvLSTM模型在氟胶指数预测中表现有效，能够抓取空间和时间相关性，但通过整合更多数据和精炼网络结构还可进一步提升性能

Abstract: The South Asian Smog refers to the recurring annual air pollution events
marked by high contaminant levels, reduced visibility, and significant
socio-economic impacts, primarily affecting the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) from
November to February. Over the past decade, increased air pollution sources
such as crop residue burning, motor vehicles, and changing weather patterns
have intensified these smog events. However, real-time forecasting systems for
increased particulate matter concentrations are still not established at
regional scale. The Aerosol Index, closely tied to smog formation and a key
component in calculating the Air Quality Index (AQI), reflects particulate
matter concentrations. This study forecasts aerosol events using Sentinel-5P
air constituent data (2019-2023) and a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory
(ConvLSTM) neural network, which captures spatial and temporal correlations
more effectively than previous models. Using the Ultraviolet (UV) Aerosol Index
at 340-380 nm as the predictor, results show the Aerosol Index can be
forecasted at five-day intervals with a Mean Squared Error of ~0.0018, loss of
~0.3995, and Structural Similarity Index of ~0.74. While effective, the model
can be improved by integrating additional data and refining its architecture.

Conclusion: 提出的SCRNet框架通过创新地结合卷积操作和交叉注意力机制，有效地解决了医学图像分割中的长程依赖和局部上下文信息的同时处理问题，为该领域提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical ultrasound image segmentation presents a formidable challenge in the
realm of computer vision. Traditional approaches rely on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based methods to address the intricacies of
medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, inherent limitations persist, as
CNN-based methods tend to disregard long-range dependencies, while
Transformer-based methods may overlook local contextual information. To address
these deficiencies, we propose a novel Feature Aggregation Module (FAM)
designed to process two input features from the preceding layer. These features
are seamlessly directed into two branches of the Convolution and
Cross-Attention Parallel Module (CCAPM) to endow them with different roles in
each of the two branches to help establish a strong connection between the two
input features. This strategy enables our module to focus concurrently on both
long-range dependencies and local contextual information by judiciously merging
convolution operations with cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, by
integrating FAM within our proposed Spatial-Channel Regulation Module (SCRM),
the ability to discern salient regions and informative features warranting
increased attention is enhanced. Furthermore, by incorporating the SCRM into
the encoder block of the UNet architecture, we introduce a novel framework
dubbed Spatial-Channel Regulation Network (SCRNet). The results of our
extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SCRNet, which consistently
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: While physics-grounded 3D motion synthesis has seen significant progress,
current methods face critical limitations. They typically rely on
pre-reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations, while physics
integration depends on either inflexible, manually defined physical attributes
or unstable, optimization-heavy guidance from video models. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce PhysGM, a feed-forward framework that jointly predicts
a 3D Gaussian representation and its physical properties from a single image,
enabling immediate, physical simulation and high-fidelity 4D rendering. We
first establish a base model by jointly optimizing for Gaussian reconstruction
and probabilistic physics prediction. The model is then refined with physically
plausible reference videos to enhance both rendering fidelity and physics
prediction accuracy. We adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align
its simulations with reference videos, circumventing Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS) optimization which needs back-propagating gradients through the
complex differentiable simulation and rasterization. To facilitate the
training, we introduce a new dataset PhysAssets of over 24,000 3D assets,
annotated with physical properties and corresponding guiding videos.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively generates
high-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in one minute. This represents
a significant speedup over prior works while delivering realistic rendering
results. Our project page is at:https://hihixiaolv.github.io/PhysGM.github.io/

Motivation: 现实环境中复杂光照条件（如低光和背光）导致的图像退化严重影响图像质量和下游视觉任务。现有方法大多只针对单一类型的光照退化，缺乏统一处理多种光照条件的能力。

Method: 提出DIME-Net框架，包含混合专家光照估计模块（使用稀疏门控机制自适应选择S曲线专家网络）和损伤修复模块（配备光照感知交叉注意力和顺序状态全局注意力机制）。构建混合光照数据集MixBL进行训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，DIME-Net在合成和真实世界的低光和背光数据集上均取得了竞争性性能，无需任何重新训练。

Conclusion: DIME-Net展示了在多样复杂光照条件下的泛化能力和实际多媒体应用潜力。

Abstract: Image degradation caused by complex lighting conditions such as low-light and
backlit scenarios is commonly encountered in real-world environments,
significantly affecting image quality and downstream vision tasks. Most
existing methods focus on a single type of illumination degradation and lack
the ability to handle diverse lighting conditions in a unified manner. To
address this issue, we propose a dual-illumination enhancement framework called
DIME-Net. The core of our method is a Mixture-of-Experts illumination estimator
module, where a sparse gating mechanism adaptively selects suitable S-curve
expert networks based on the illumination characteristics of the input image.
By integrating Retinex theory, this module effectively performs enhancement
tailored to both low-light and backlit images. To further correct
illumination-induced artifacts and color distortions, we design a damage
restoration module equipped with Illumination-Aware Cross Attention and
Sequential-State Global Attention mechanisms. In addition, we construct a
hybrid illumination dataset, MixBL, by integrating existing datasets, allowing
our model to achieve robust illumination adaptability through a single training
process. Experimental results show that DIME-Net achieves competitive
performance on both synthetic and real-world low-light and backlit datasets
without any retraining. These results demonstrate its generalization ability
and potential for practical multimedia applications under diverse and complex
illumination conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的人脸图像质量评估方法主要依赖卷积神经网络，而Vision Transformer架构的潜力尚未被充分探索，需要开发基于Transformer的FIQA方法。

Method: 扩展标准ViT骨干网络，添加可学习的质量token与图像块token拼接，通过全局自注意力聚合上下文信息，使用双头结构分别进行人脸特征学习和质量分数回归。

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的基准测试和不同FR模型上，ViT-FIQA始终达到顶级性能，证明了Transformer架构在建模人脸图像效用方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的架构在FIQA任务中表现出色，ViT有潜力作为未来FIQA研究的可扩展基础框架。

Abstract: Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) aims to predict the utility of a face
image for face recognition (FR) systems. State-of-the-art FIQA methods mainly
rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leaving the potential of Vision
Transformer (ViT) architectures underexplored. This work proposes ViT-FIQA, a
novel approach that extends standard ViT backbones, originally optimized for
FR, through a learnable quality token designed to predict a scalar utility
score for any given face image. The learnable quality token is concatenated
with the standard image patch tokens, and the whole sequence is processed via
global self-attention by the ViT encoders to aggregate contextual information
across all patches. At the output of the backbone, ViT-FIQA branches into two
heads: (1) the patch tokens are passed through a fully connected layer to learn
discriminative face representations via a margin-penalty softmax loss, and (2)
the quality token is fed into a regression head to learn to predict the face
sample's utility. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks and several
FR models, including both CNN- and ViT-based architectures, demonstrate that
ViT-FIQA consistently achieves top-tier performance. These results underscore
the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures in modeling face image
utility and highlight the potential of ViTs as a scalable foundation for future
FIQA research https://cutt.ly/irHlzXUC.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task for 3D scene understanding in
autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Existing depth datasets,
such as KITTI, nuScenes, and DDAD, have advanced the field but suffer from
limitations in diversity and scalability. As benchmark performance on these
datasets approaches saturation, there is an increasing need for a new
generation of large-scale, diverse, and cost-efficient datasets to support the
era of foundation models and multi-modal learning. To address these challenges,
we introduce a large-scale, diverse, frame-wise continuous dataset for depth
estimation in dynamic outdoor driving environments, comprising 20K video frames
to evaluate existing methods. Our lightweight acquisition pipeline ensures
broad scene coverage at low cost, while sparse yet statistically sufficient
ground truth enables robust training. Compared to existing datasets, ours
presents greater diversity in driving scenarios and lower depth density,
creating new challenges for generalization. Benchmark experiments with standard
monocular depth estimation models validate the dataset's utility and highlight
substantial performance gaps in challenging conditions, establishing a new
platform for advancing depth estimation research.

Abstract: Video action detection requires dense spatio-temporal annotations, which are
both challenging and expensive to obtain. However, real-world videos often vary
in difficulty and may not require the same level of annotation. This paper
analyzes the appropriate annotation types for each sample and their impact on
spatio-temporal video action detection. It focuses on two key aspects: 1) how
to obtain varying levels of annotation for videos, and 2) how to learn action
detection from different annotation types. The study explores video-level tags,
points, scribbles, bounding boxes, and pixel-level masks. First, a simple
active learning strategy is proposed to estimate the necessary annotation type
for each video. Then, a novel spatio-temporal 3D-superpixel approach is
introduced to generate pseudo-labels from these annotations, enabling effective
training. The approach is validated on UCF101-24 and JHMDB-21 datasets,
significantly cutting annotation costs with minimal performance loss.

Abstract: Outside of urban hubs, autonomous cars and trucks have to master driving on
intercity highways. Safe, long-distance highway travel at speeds exceeding 100
km/h demands perception distances of at least 250 m, which is about five times
the 50-100m typically addressed in city driving, to allow sufficient planning
and braking margins. Increasing the perception ranges also allows to extend
autonomy from light two-ton passenger vehicles to large-scale forty-ton trucks,
which need a longer planning horizon due to their high inertia. However, most
existing perception approaches focus on shorter ranges and rely on Bird's Eye
View (BEV) representations, which incur quadratic increases in memory and
compute costs as distance grows. To overcome this limitation, we built on top
of a sparse representation and introduced an efficient 3D encoding of
multi-modal and temporal features, along with a novel self-supervised
pre-training scheme that enables large-scale learning from unlabeled
camera-LiDAR data. Our approach extends perception distances to 250 meters and
achieves an 26.6% improvement in mAP in object detection and a decrease of
30.5% in Chamfer Distance in LiDAR forecasting compared to existing methods,
reaching distances up to 250 meters. Project Page:

Abstract: Modern 3D generation methods can rapidly create shapes from sparse or single
views, but their outputs often lack geometric detail due to computational
constraints. We present DetailGen3D, a generative approach specifically
designed to enhance these generated 3D shapes. Our key insight is to model the
coarse-to-fine transformation directly through data-dependent flows in latent
space, avoiding the computational overhead of large-scale 3D generative models.
We introduce a token matching strategy that ensures accurate spatial
correspondence during refinement, enabling local detail synthesis while
preserving global structure. By carefully designing our training data to match
the characteristics of synthesized coarse shapes, our method can effectively
enhance shapes produced by various 3D generation and reconstruction approaches,
from single-view to sparse multi-view inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DetailGen3D achieves high-fidelity geometric detail synthesis while

Conclusion: 通过智能选择非关键帧来补充关键帧的不足，该方法能够在在线条件下生成高质量、完整的3D高斯涂射模型

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of generating online 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) models from RGB-only frames. Previous studies have employed dense SLAM
techniques to estimate 3D scenes from keyframes for 3DGS model construction.
However, these methods are limited by their reliance solely on keyframes, which
are insufficient to capture an entire scene, resulting in incomplete
reconstructions. Moreover, building a generalizable model requires
incorporating frames from diverse viewpoints to achieve broader scene coverage.
However, online processing restricts the use of many frames or extensive
training iterations. Therefore, we propose a novel method for high-quality 3DGS
modeling that improves model completeness through adaptive view selection. By
analyzing reconstruction quality online, our approach selects optimal
non-keyframes for additional training. By integrating both keyframes and
selected non-keyframes, the method refines incomplete regions from diverse
viewpoints, significantly enhancing completeness. We also present a framework
that incorporates an online multi-view stereo approach, ensuring consistency in
3D information throughout the 3DGS modeling process. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering
exceptional performance in complex outdoor scenes.

suffers vulnerability to data poisoning backdoor attacks (DPCLs). An adversary
can inject poisoned images into pretraining datasets, causing compromised CL
encoders to exhibit targeted misbehavior in downstream tasks. Existing DPCLs,
however, achieve limited efficacy due to their dependence on fragile implicit
co-occurrence between backdoor and target object and inadequate suppression of
discriminative features in backdoored images. We propose Noisy Alignment (NA),
a DPCL method that explicitly suppresses noise components in poisoned images.
Inspired by powerful training-controllable CL attacks, we identify and extract
the critical objective of noisy alignment, adapting it effectively into
data-poisoning scenarios. Our method implements noisy alignment by
strategically manipulating contrastive learning's random cropping mechanism,
formulating this process as an image layout optimization problem with
theoretically derived optimal parameters. The resulting method is simple yet
effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to existing DPCLs,
while maintaining clean-data accuracy. Furthermore, Noisy Alignment
demonstrates robustness against common backdoor defenses. Codes can be found at

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的稀疏帧视频录音技术InfiniteTalk，能够在保持身份识别和标志性手势的同时，实现音频驱动的全身动作编辑，充分解决了传统嘴部编辑技术导致的面部表情和身体手势不协调问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频录音技术仅限于嘴部区域编辑，导致面部表情和身体手势不协调，影响观众沉浸式体验。需要一种能够进行全身动作同步编辑的新方法。

Method: 提出稀疏帧视频录音新范式，通过策略性保留参考关键帧来维持身份识别、标志性手势和摄像机轨迹。设计InfiniteTalk流式音频驱动生成器，利用时间上下文帧实现无缝块过渡，采用简单有效的采样策略优化控制强度。

Result: 在HDTF、CelebV-HQ和EMTD数据集上进行综合评估，展现出领先的性能。数据指标证实了更优秀的视觉真实性、情感一致性和全身动作同步性。

Conclusion: InfiniteTalk成功解决了传统视频录音技术的限制，通过稀疏帧方法实现了高质量的音频驱动全身动画生成，为视频AIGC领域带来了重要进步。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video AIGC have ushered in a transformative era for
audio-driven human animation. However, conventional video dubbing techniques
remain constrained to mouth region editing, resulting in discordant facial
expressions and body gestures that compromise viewer immersion. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce sparse-frame video dubbing, a novel paradigm that
strategically preserves reference keyframes to maintain identity, iconic
gestures, and camera trajectories while enabling holistic, audio-synchronized
full-body motion editing. Through critical analysis, we identify why naive
image-to-video models fail in this task, particularly their inability to
achieve adaptive conditioning. Addressing this, we propose InfiniteTalk, a
streaming audio-driven generator designed for infinite-length long sequence
dubbing. This architecture leverages temporal context frames for seamless
inter-chunk transitions and incorporates a simple yet effective sampling
strategy that optimizes control strength via fine-grained reference frame
positioning. Comprehensive evaluations on HDTF, CelebV-HQ, and EMTD datasets
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Quantitative metrics confirm superior
visual realism, emotional coherence, and full-body motion synchronization.

Motivation: 3D高斯拓扑矩阵虽然在新视角合成上表现突出，但需要大量3D高斯元素导致内存和存储消耗过高

Method: 提出知识蓄粉框架，使用普通3DGS、噪声增强和dropout正则化版本的多老师模型，通过结构相似性损失促进学生模型的几何结构一致性

Result: 在多个数据集上的定量和定性评估显示，方法在渲染质量和存储效率方面都达到了最先进水平

Conclusion: Distilled-3DGS是一个简单但有效的框架，通过知识蓄粉技术成功解决了3DGS的存储效率问题

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has exhibited remarkable efficacy in novel view
synthesis (NVS). However, it suffers from a significant drawback: achieving
high-fidelity rendering typically necessitates a large number of 3D Gaussians,
resulting in substantial memory consumption and storage requirements. To
address this challenge, we propose the first knowledge distillation framework
for 3DGS, featuring various teacher models, including vanilla 3DGS,
noise-augmented variants, and dropout-regularized versions. The outputs of
these teachers are aggregated to guide the optimization of a lightweight
student model. To distill the hidden geometric structure, we propose a
structural similarity loss to boost the consistency of spatial geometric
distributions between the student and teacher model. Through comprehensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across diverse datasets, the proposed
Distilled-3DGS, a simple yet effective framework without bells and whistles,
achieves promising rendering results in both rendering quality and storage
efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. Project page:

Abstract: Composed video retrieval is a challenging task that strives to retrieve a
target video based on a query video and a textual description detailing
specific modifications. Standard retrieval frameworks typically struggle to
handle the complexity of fine-grained compositional queries and variations in
temporal understanding limiting their retrieval ability in the fine-grained
setting. To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset that captures both
fine-grained and composed actions across diverse video segments, enabling more
detailed compositional changes in retrieved video content. The proposed
dataset, named Dense-WebVid-CoVR, consists of 1.6 million samples with dense
modification text that is around seven times more than its existing
counterpart. We further develop a new model that integrates visual and textual
information through Cross-Attention (CA) fusion using grounded text encoder,
enabling precise alignment between dense query modifications and target videos.
The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results surpassing existing
methods on all metrics. Notably, it achieves 71.3\% Recall@1 in visual+text
setting and outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3.4\%, highlighting its
efficacy in terms of leveraging detailed video descriptions and dense
modification texts. Our proposed dataset, code, and model are available at

Motivation: 大语言模型输出往往反映了训练数据中的结构性性别不平衡问题，需要开发更有效的检测和减少性别歧视的方法。

Method: 基于话语感知公平性分析的前期工作，引入了新的演员级别指标，包括情感、句法主体性和引用风格的不对称性。支持诊断性语料分析和排除基于再平衡。

Result: 在taz2024full德国报纸语料库(1980-2024)中实验，多个语言维度上显示出性别平衡的显著改善。表面级别不对称可通过过滤和重新平衡减少，但情感和框架中的更细微偏见仍持续存在。

Conclusion: 该流水线能够有效检测和减少大规模文本语料中的性别歧视，为话语基于公平性审计和公平语料建设提供了工具支持。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly shaping digital communication, yet
their outputs often reflect structural gender imbalances that originate from
their training data. This paper presents an extended actor-level pipeline for
detecting and mitigating gender discrimination in large-scale text corpora.
Building on prior work in discourse-aware fairness analysis, we introduce new
actor-level metrics that capture asymmetries in sentiment, syntactic agency,
and quotation styles. The pipeline supports both diagnostic corpus analysis and
exclusion-based balancing, enabling the construction of fairer corpora. We
apply our approach to the taz2024full corpus of German newspaper articles from
1980 to 2024, demonstrating substantial improvements in gender balance across
multiple linguistic dimensions. Our results show that while surface-level
asymmetries can be mitigated through filtering and rebalancing, subtler forms
of bias persist, particularly in sentiment and framing. We release the tools
and reports to support further research in discourse-based fairness auditing
and equitable corpus construction.

Motivation: 现有基准测试如BrowseComp主要关注文本信息，忽略了网页中普遍存在的多模态内容，需要填补这一空白

Method: 创建包含224个挑战性问题的基准测试，问题提示中包含图像，网页搜索和推理过程中的关键信息可能嵌入在图像或视频中，并提供验证清单进行细粒度分析

Result: 对最先进模型的评估显示，即使是OpenAI o3等顶级模型准确率也只有29.02%，表明当前模型的多模态能力不足且缺乏原生多模态推理

Conclusion: 当前AI模型在多模态网页浏览方面表现不佳，需要开发更好的多模态推理能力

Abstract: AI agents with advanced reasoning and tool use capabilities have demonstrated
impressive performance in web browsing for deep search. While existing
benchmarks such as BrowseComp evaluate these browsing abilities, they primarily
focus on textual information, overlooking the prevalence of multimodal content.
To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-BrowseComp, a novel benchmark comprising
224 challenging, hand-crafted questions specifically designed to assess agents'
multimodal retrieval and reasoning capabilities. These questions often
incorporate images in prompts, and crucial information encountered during the
search and reasoning process may also be embedded within images or videos on
webpages. Consequently, methods relying solely on text prove insufficient for
our benchmark. Additionally, we provide a verified checklist for each question,
enabling fine-grained analysis of multimodal dependencies and reasoning paths.
Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models on MM-BrowseComp
reveals that even top models like OpenAI o3 with tools achieve only 29.02\%
accuracy, highlighting the suboptimal multimodal capabilities and lack of
native multimodal reasoning in current models.

Motivation: 虽然现有的RNN-T基础ASR系统能够实时转写，但实现实时流式翻译仍面临重大挑战，需要在翻译质量和延迟之间找到平衡。

Method: 提出同步翻译方法，利用ASR系统生成的语言线索来管理上下文，采用高效的束搜索剪枝技术（如超时和强制终止）来维持系统的实时因子。

Result: 在设备上的双语对话语音翻译中应用，该方法在延迟和质量方面都超过了基线系统，缩小了与非流式翻译系统的质量差距。

Abstract: This paper tackles several challenges that arise when integrating Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) and Machine Translation (MT) for real-time, on-device
streaming speech translation. Although state-of-the-art ASR systems based on
Recurrent Neural Network Transducers (RNN-T) can perform real-time
transcription, achieving streaming translation in real-time remains a
significant challenge. To address this issue, we propose a simultaneous
translation approach that effectively balances translation quality and latency.
We also investigate efficient integration of ASR and MT, leveraging linguistic
cues generated by the ASR system to manage context and utilizing efficient
beam-search pruning techniques such as time-out and forced finalization to
maintain system's real-time factor. We apply our approach to an on-device
bilingual conversational speech translation and demonstrate that our techniques
outperform baselines in terms of latency and quality. Notably, our technique
narrows the quality gap with non-streaming translation systems, paving the way
for more accurate and efficient real-time speech translation.

Motivation: 利用推理模型提升LLM性能的趋势，习语检测作为需要理解后再推理的语言任务可能受益于此框架

Method: 评估DeepSeek-R1蒸馏模型系列(1.5B-70B参数)在四个习语检测数据集上的表现，分析思维链推理效果和模型大小影响

Result: 推理效果较小且多变：小模型CoT推理从数学调优中间模型提升性能但不及基础模型；大模型(14B+)显示适度改进；大模型能准确产生表达式定义，小模型常失败

Conclusion: 大模型展现良好习语理解能力，小模型通过提示中提供定义可在某些情况下改善性能，推理对习语检测的影响比预期有限

Abstract: The recent trend towards utilisation of reasoning models has improved the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across many tasks which involve
logical steps. One linguistic task that could benefit from this framing is
idiomaticity detection, as a potentially idiomatic expression must first be
understood before it can be disambiguated and serves as a basis for reasoning.
In this paper, we explore how reasoning capabilities in LLMs affect
idiomaticity detection performance and examine the effect of model size. We
evaluate, as open source representative models, the suite of DeepSeek-R1
distillation models ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters across four
idiomaticity detection datasets. We find the effect of reasoning to be smaller
and more varied than expected. For smaller models, producing chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning increases performance from Math-tuned intermediate models, but
not to the levels of the base models, whereas larger models (14B, 32B, and 70B)
show modest improvements. Our in-depth analyses reveal that larger models
demonstrate good understanding of idiomaticity, successfully producing accurate
definitions of expressions, while smaller models often fail to output the
actual meaning. For this reason, we also experiment with providing definitions
in the prompts of smaller models, which we show can improve performance in some
cases.

Motivation: ASR系统在长音频转译中常常无法维持语法和语义的准确性，影响命名实体识别、大写化和标点符号等任务的性能

Method: 使用两种策略：(1)令牌级利用最优运输进行维度和序列长度对齐的精炼；(2)通过最小化Whisper和LLaMA句子嵌入表示之间的表示损失，融合语法和语义知识

Result: 在Spoken Wikipedia数据集上评估显示，在词错误率(WER)、命名实体识别、大写化和标点符号成功率方面都取得了显著改善

Conclusion: 通过引入新的NER指标和探索语义感知ASR，这项工作强调了将语言上下文集成到转译中的价值，为长形式语音的稳健、上下文感知ASR系统奠定了基础

Abstract: ASR systems often struggle with maintaining syntactic and semantic accuracy
in long audio transcripts, impacting tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER),
capitalization, and punctuation. We propose a novel approach that enhances ASR
by distilling contextual knowledge from LLaMA models into Whisper. Our method
uses two strategies: (1) token level distillation with optimal transport to
align dimensions and sequence lengths, and (2) representation loss minimization
between sentence embeddings of Whisper and LLaMA, blending syntax and
semantics. Evaluations on the Spoken Wikipedia dataset, a benchmark with long
audios and rich entities demonstrate significant improvements in Word Error
Rate (WER), NER, capitalization, and punctuation success. By introducing novel
NER metrics and exploring semantics aware ASR, our work highlights the value of
integrating linguistic context into transcription, setting a foundation for
robust, context-aware ASR in longform speech.

Motivation: 解决传统LLM在复杂问题求解中存在的格式崩溃、冗长循环和推理不连贯等问题，通过轨迹式训练和双奖励机制提升模型的分析能力和效率。

Method: 1) 轨迹中心合成数据生成器产生144,000个标记笔记本片段；2) 双奖励框架结合标签结构信号和分层奖励模型；3) 内存优化的GRPO实现，包含KV缓存重用和顺序生成；4) 余弦课程从结构保真度平滑过渡到语义深度。

Result: 在标准公开基准测试中超越同规模模型，达到QwQ-32B等更大推理模型的水平，在AIME 2024/2025和LiveCodeBench上准确率提升30%，同时每个解决方案减少18-49%的token输出。

Conclusion: Datarus通过创新的轨迹式训练和双奖励机制，成功解决了LLM在复杂问题求解中的常见问题，实现了更高效、更准确的分析能力，为虚拟数据分析师模型的发展提供了有效路径。

Abstract: We present Datarus-R1-14B, a 14 B-parameter open-weights language model
fine-tuned from Qwen 2.5-14B-Instruct to act as a virtual data analyst and
graduate-level problem solver. Datarus is trained not on isolated
question-answer pairs but on full analytical trajectories including reasoning
steps, code execution, error traces, self-corrections, and final conclusions,
all captured in a ReAct-style notebook format spanning finance, medicine,
numerical analysis, and other quantitative domains. Our training pipeline
combines (i) a trajectory-centric synthetic data generator that yielded 144 000
tagged notebook episodes, (ii) a dual-reward framework blending a lightweight
tag-based structural signal with a Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM) that scores
both single-step soundness and end-to-end coherence, and (iii) a
memory-optimized implementation of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
featuring KV-cache reuse, sequential generation, and reference-model sharding.
A cosine curriculum smoothly shifts emphasis from structural fidelity to
semantic depth, reducing the format collapse and verbosity that often plague
RL-aligned LLMs. A central design choice in Datarus is it dual reasoning
interface. In agentic mode the model produces ReAct-tagged steps that invoke
Python tools to execute real code; in reflection mode it outputs compact
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces delimited by <think> and <answer> tags. On
demanding postgraduate-level problems, Datarus exhibits an "AHA-moment"
pattern: it sketches hypotheses, revises them once or twice, and converges
avoiding the circular, token-inflating loops common to contemporary systems.
Across standard public benchmarks Datarus surpasses similar size models and
even reaches the level of larger reasoning models such as QwQ-32B achieving up
to 30% higher accuracy on AIME 2024/2025 and LiveCodeBench while emitting
18-49% fewer tokens per solution.

Method: 利用Small-World-of-Words项目的英语-美国和普通话词语联想规范，通过监督微调(SFT)和PPO基于偏好优化方法对Llama-3.1-8B和Qwen-2.5-7B进行参数效率学习

Result: SFT在英语中将P@5提升16-20%，在普通话中提升43-165%，提高了具体性程度，达到人类水平的情感价值和激活度。在世界价值观调查中，微调模型向目标文化偏移，Qwen的中国对齐回复增加一倍，Llama的美国偏差减少33%

Conclusion: 7-8B模型的表现可与70B基准模型相比或更好，证明几百万个基于文化的联想可以在不需昂贵重新训练的情况下实现价值对齐，强调了基于人类认知进行文化对齐研究的前景和必要性

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate cross-cultural
communication, their behavior still reflects the distributional bias of the
languages and viewpoints that are over-represented in their pre-training
corpora. Yet, it remains a challenge to model and align culture due to limited
cultural knowledge and a lack of exploration into effective learning
approaches. We introduce a cost-efficient, cognitively grounded remedy:
parameter-efficient fine-tuning on native speakers' free word-association
norms, which encode implicit cultural schemas. Leveraging English-US and
Mandarin associations from the Small-World-of-Words project, we adapt
Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and PPO-based
preference optimization. SFT boosts held-out association Precision at 5 by
16-20% in English and 43-165% in Mandarin, lifts median concreteness by +0.20,
and attains human-level valence and arousal. These lexical gains transfer: on
World-Values-Survey questions, fine-tuned models shift answer distributions
toward the target culture, and on a 50-item high-tension subset, Qwen's
Chinese-aligned responses double while Llama's US bias drops by one-third. Our
7-8B models rival or beat vanilla 70B baselines, showing that a few million
culture-grounded associations can instill value alignment without costly
retraining. Our work highlights both the promise and the need for future
research grounded in human cognition in improving cultural alignment in AI
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的医疗大语言模型主要采用被动回答模式，无法在临床咨询中主动获取信息，这可能导致错误诊断。需要开发能够主动提问的模型来模拟真实医生的交互式问诊过程。

Method: 提出ProMed强化学习框架，核心是Shapley信息增益(SIG)奖励机制，结合两阶段训练：1)SIG引导的模型初始化使用蒙特卡洛树搜索构建高质量交互轨迹；2)SIG增强的策略优化整合SIG奖励分布机制进行针对性优化。

Result: 在两个新构建的部分信息医疗基准测试中，ProMed平均比最先进方法提升6.29%，相比被动范式提升54.45%，并且在域外案例中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: ProMed成功将医疗LLM转变为主动提问范式，通过SIG奖励机制有效量化问题的临床价值，显著提升了在交互式医疗场景中的诊断准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Interactive medical questioning is essential in real-world clinical
consultations, where physicians must actively gather information from patients.
While medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
in static medical question answering, they predominantly operate under a
reactive paradigm: generating answers directly without seeking additional
information, which risks incorrect diagnoses in such interactive settings. To
address this limitation, we propose ProMed, a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework that transitions medical LLMs toward a proactive paradigm, equipping
them with the ability to ask clinically valuable questions before
decision-making. At the core of ProMed is the Shapley Information Gain (SIG)
reward, which quantifies the clinical utility of each question by combining the
amount of newly acquired information with its contextual importance, estimated
via Shapley values. We integrate SIG into a two-stage training pipeline: (1)
SIG-Guided Model Initialization uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
construct high-reward interaction trajectories to supervise the model, and (2)
SIG-Augmented Policy Optimization, which integrates SIG and enhances RL with a
novel SIG-guided Reward Distribution Mechanism that assigns higher rewards to
informative questions for targeted optimization. Extensive experiments on two
newly curated partial-information medical benchmarks demonstrate that ProMed
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.29% and
delivers a 54.45% gain over the reactive paradigm, while also generalizing
robustly to out-of-domain cases.

Conclusion: LoRA微调方法能够有效提升LLM对沙特方言的支持能力，方言标签方案在控制能力和保真度方面都超过了其他基线模型，且避免了元数据标签回显问题

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for Arabic are still dominated by Modern
Standard Arabic (MSA), with limited support for Saudi dialects such as Najdi
and Hijazi. This underrepresentation hinders their ability to capture authentic
dialectal variation. Using a privately curated Saudi Dialect Instruction
dataset (Hijazi and Najdi; 5,466 synthetic instruction-response pairs; 50/50
split), we LoRA-tune ALLaM-7B-Instruct-preview, the first foundation model
developed in Saudi Arabia, for Saudi dialect generation. We investigate two
variants: (i) Dialect-Token training, which prepends an explicit dialect tag to
the instruction, and (ii) No-Token training, which omits the tag at formatting
time. Evaluation on a held-out test set combines an external dialect classifier
with text fidelity metrics (chrF++ and BERTScore) and diversity measures. The
Dialect-Token model achieves the best control, raising the Saudi rate from
47.97% to 84.21% and reducing MSA leakage from 32.63% to 6.21%; fidelity also
improves (chrF++ +3.53, BERTScore +0.059). Both LoRA variants outperform strong
generic instruction models (Falcon-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct,
Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct, AceGPT-v2-8B-Chat, JAIS-13B-Chat) in dialect control and
fidelity, while avoiding metadata-tag echoing that these baselines frequently
exhibit. We do not release the dataset or any model weights/adapters; instead,
we release training/evaluation/inference code and a detailed datasheet (schema
and aggregate statistics) to support independent verification.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MATA, a novel evaluation dataset to assess the
ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Telugu language, comprising 729
carefully curated multiple-choice and open-ended questions that span diverse
linguistic dimensions. We evaluate 11 open-weight and closed-source LLMs on our
dataset and present a fine-grained analysis of their performance. Further, we
empirically show how LLMs rely on superficial heuristics such as answer
position and distractor patterns for multiple-choice questions. Finally, we
also compare LLM-as-a-judge evaluation with human evaluation for open-ended
questions and draw some conclusions on its reliability in a low-resource
language. We argue that such fine-grained evaluation is essential for
understanding model limitations and can inform the development of more
linguistically capable LLMs, while also serving as a foundation for future
research in Telugu NLP.

*Rohit Raj Rai,Chirag Kothari,Siddhesh Shelke,Amit Awekar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 模型压缩后虽然精度相似，但解释性和检验与原模型存在显著差异，不能直接作为可信赖替代


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究主要关注压缩模型的精度性能，但性能平等并不保证可信赖性相等，需要从解释性和检验两个维度评估压缩模型的可信赖性

Method: 提出两维评估框架：1）解释性对齐（使用LIME和SHAP测试）测量模型是否基于相同特征做决策；2）检验相似性（使用ECE、MCE、Brier Score和可靠性图）测量模型预测概率的可靠性

Result: 实验结果显示压缩模型与原模型在解释性对齐和检验相似性方面存在显著差异，即使在精度几乎相同的情况下也如此

Conclusion: 压缩模型并非原模型的可信赖替代品，部署压缩模型需要超越简单性能对比的详细评估，确保其解释性和可靠性与原模型保持一致

Abstract: Large Deep Learning models are often compressed before being deployed in a
resource-constrained environment. Can we trust the prediction of compressed
models just as we trust the prediction of the original large model? Existing
work has keenly studied the effect of compression on accuracy and related
performance measures. However, performance parity does not guarantee
trust-equivalence. We propose a two-dimensional framework for trust-equivalence
evaluation. First, interpretability alignment measures whether the models base
their predictions on the same input features. We use LIME and SHAP tests to
measure the interpretability alignment. Second, calibration similarity measures
whether the models exhibit comparable reliability in their predicted
probabilities. It is assessed via ECE, MCE, Brier Score, and reliability
diagrams. We conducted experiments using BERT-base as the large model and its
multiple compressed variants. We focused on two text classification tasks:
natural language inference and paraphrase identification. Our results reveal
low interpretability alignment and significant mismatch in calibration
similarity. It happens even when the accuracies are nearly identical between
models. These findings show that compressed models are not trust-equivalent to
their large counterparts. Deploying compressed models as a drop-in replacement
for large models requires careful assessment, going beyond performance parity.

*Oriana Presacan,Alireza Nik,Vajira Thambawita,Bogdan Ionescu,Michael Riegler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 在医疗文本生成任务中，确定性解码策略（如beam search）通常优于随机策略，模型大小和医疗专业化对性能的影响不如解码策略选择重要


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗领域文本生成中，解码策略对输出质量的影响尚未得到充分研究，而医疗应用对准确性要求极高，需要系统评估不同解码策略的效果

Method: 在5个开放式医疗任务（翻译、摘要、问答、对话、图像描述）上评估11种解码策略，使用医疗专业和通用LLM不同尺寸模型，比较多种评估指标

Result: beam search表现最佳，随机采样策略最差；大模型整体得分更高但推理时间更长；医疗LLM仅在2/5任务中优于通用模型，且对解码策略更敏感；不同评估指标相关性因任务而异

Conclusion: 解码策略选择在医疗应用中至关重要，其影响有时甚至超过模型选择，需要根据具体任务谨慎选择解码方法

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on various decoding strategies to generate
text, and these choices can significantly affect output quality. In healthcare,
where accuracy is critical, the impact of decoding strategies remains
underexplored. We investigate this effect in five open-ended medical tasks,
including translation, summarization, question answering, dialogue, and image
captioning, evaluating 11 decoding strategies with medically specialized and
general-purpose LLMs of different sizes. Our results show that deterministic
strategies generally outperform stochastic ones: beam search achieves the
highest scores, while {\eta} and top-k sampling perform worst. Slower decoding
methods tend to yield better quality. Larger models achieve higher scores
overall but have longer inference times and are no more robust to decoding.
Surprisingly, while medical LLMs outperform general ones in two of the five
tasks, statistical analysis shows no overall performance advantage and reveals
greater sensitivity to decoding choice. We further compare multiple evaluation
metrics and find that correlations vary by task, with MAUVE showing weak
agreement with BERTScore and ROUGE, as well as greater sensitivity to the
decoding strategy. These results highlight the need for careful selection of
decoding methods in medical applications, as their influence can sometimes
exceed that of model choice.

Motivation: 研究语音LLM是否像文本LLM一样存在性别偏见，利用说话者分配作为分析工具来探索模型的性别意识和偏向

Method: 构建两个数据集：职业数据集（包含性别刻板印职业）和性别色彩词汇数据集，分析Bark TTS模型在文本提示下的默认说话者分配

Result: Bark模型没有显示系统性偏见，但表现出性别意识和某些性别倾向

Conclusion: 语音LLM展现出性别意识但无明显系统偏见，说话者选择可作为有效的偏见分析工具

Abstract: Similar to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), Speech-LLMs exhibit
emergent abilities and context awareness. However, whether these similarities
extend to gender bias remains an open question. This study proposes a
methodology leveraging speaker assignment as an analytic tool for bias
investigation. Unlike text-based models, which encode gendered associations
implicitly, Speech-LLMs must produce a gendered voice, making speaker selection
an explicit bias cue. We evaluate Bark, a Text-to-Speech (TTS) model, analyzing
its default speaker assignments for textual prompts. If Bark's speaker
selection systematically aligns with gendered associations, it may reveal
patterns in its training data or model design. To test this, we construct two
datasets: (i) Professions, containing gender-stereotyped occupations, and (ii)
Gender-Colored Words, featuring gendered connotations. While Bark does not
exhibit systematic bias, it demonstrates gender awareness and has some gender
inclinations.

TL;DR: CRISP是一种基于稀疏自编码器的参数高效方法，用于实现持久性概念遗忘，通过识别和抑制多层的显著特征来移除有害知识，同时保持模型效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在现实应用中的部署增加，需要选择性移除不良知识同时保持模型效用。现有稀疏自编码器方法主要在推理时操作，无法实现参数层面的持久改变，容易被恶意行为者绕过。

Method: CRISP自动识别多层中的显著SAE特征并抑制其激活，实现参数高效的持久性概念遗忘。

Result: 在两个LLM上的实验表明，CRISP在WMDP基准的安全关键遗忘任务上优于先前方法，成功移除有害知识的同时保持通用和领域内能力。特征级分析显示CRISP实现了目标与良性概念的语义分离。

Conclusion: CRISP提供了一种有效的参数级持久概念遗忘方法，能够精确抑制目标特征，为模型安全部署提供了重要技术手段。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, the need to selectively remove unwanted knowledge while
preserving model utility has become paramount. Recent work has explored sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to perform precise interventions on monosemantic features.
However, most SAE-based methods operate at inference time, which does not
create persistent changes in the model's parameters. Such interventions can be
bypassed or reversed by malicious actors with parameter access. We introduce
CRISP, a parameter-efficient method for persistent concept unlearning using
SAEs. CRISP automatically identifies salient SAE features across multiple
layers and suppresses their activations. We experiment with two LLMs and show
that our method outperforms prior approaches on safety-critical unlearning
tasks from the WMDP benchmark, successfully removing harmful knowledge while
preserving general and in-domain capabilities. Feature-level analysis reveals
that CRISP achieves semantically coherent separation between target and benign
concepts, allowing precise suppression of the target features.

TL;DR: 该研究首次全面评估了视觉语言模型在越南语多模态教育考试中的表现，发现当前最先进的模型仅达到57.74%的准确率，远低于人类平均水平66.54%，仅有一个思维模型略超人类平均但仍远低于人类最佳表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型在低资源语言（越南语）多模态教育内容上的表现，验证主要基于英语数据训练的模型是否能处理真实世界的跨语言多模态推理任务。

Method: 提出ViExam基准测试，包含2,548个多模态问题，涵盖7个学术领域；测试了最先进和开源视觉语言模型的性能，并尝试了跨语言提示和人类协作等策略。

Result: 最先进模型平均准确率57.74%，开源模型27.70%；仅o3思维模型(74.07%)超过人类平均(66.54%)但仍远低于人类最佳(99.60%)；跨语言提示反而降低性能1个百分点；人类协作可提升5个百分点。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在处理越南语多模态教育内容时表现不佳，跨语言迁移能力有限，需要针对低资源语言进行专门优化，人类协作能部分改善但仍有很大提升空间。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on English
multimodal tasks, but their performance on low-resource languages with
genuinely multimodal educational content remains largely unexplored. In this
work, we test how VLMs perform on Vietnamese educational assessments,
investigating whether VLMs trained predominantly on English data can handle
real-world cross-lingual multimodal reasoning. Our work presents the first
comprehensive evaluation of VLM capabilities on multimodal Vietnamese exams
through proposing ViExam, a benchmark containing 2,548 multimodal questions. We
find that state-of-the-art VLMs achieve only 57.74% while open-source models
achieve 27.70% mean accuracy across 7 academic domains, including Mathematics,
Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, Driving Test, and IQ Test. Most VLMs
underperform average human test-takers (66.54%), with only the thinking VLM o3
(74.07%) exceeding human average performance, yet still falling substantially
short of human best performance (99.60%). Cross-lingual prompting with English
instructions while maintaining Vietnamese content fails to improve performance,
decreasing accuracy by 1 percentage point for SOTA VLMs. Human-in-the-loop
collaboration can partially improve VLM performance by 5 percentage points.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用汇总性语句（如'鸟会飞'）在语言学、哲学、逻辑学和认知科学中具有重要地位，需要研究LLM如何处理这种允许异常的默认推理模式。

Method: 使用20种可撤销推理模式测试28个LLM，测试了零样本、少样本和链式思绪（CoT）提示方式下的表现。

Result: 前沿模型在默认推理问题上表现良好，但模型间性能差异显著；少样本提示有些改善，但CoT提示导致平均准确率下降11.14%；大多数模型无法区分可撤销和弗式推理或将通用语解读为全称语句。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在默认推理方面既有潜力也有限制，需要更好地处理可撤销推理和通用语的复杂特性。

Abstract: This paper evaluates the capabilities of 28 large language models (LLMs) to
reason with 20 defeasible reasoning patterns involving generic generalizations
(e.g., 'Birds fly', 'Ravens are black') central to non-monotonic logic.
Generics are of special interest to linguists, philosophers, logicians, and
cognitive scientists because of their complex exception-permitting behaviour
and their centrality to default reasoning, cognition, and concept acquisition.
We find that while several frontier models handle many default reasoning
problems well, performance varies widely across models and prompting styles.
Few-shot prompting modestly improves performance for some models, but
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting often leads to serious performance degradation
(mean accuracy drop -11.14%, SD 15.74% in models performing above 75% accuracy
in zero-shot condition, temperature 0). Most models either struggle to
distinguish between defeasible and deductive inference or misinterpret generics
as universal statements. These findings underscore both the promise and limits
of current LLMs for default reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文挑战了通过预测准确率来判断词嵌入中语义知识编码的假设，证明即使随机信息也能被成功预测，说明现有方法主要反映向量空间几何相似性而非真正的语义表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解深度学习模型中隐含编码的知识对于提高AI系统可解释性至关重要，但现有方法假设预测语义特征的准确率能反映词嵌入中的知识，这一假设需要验证。

Method: 通过分析常见词嵌入解释方法，特别是将词嵌入映射到人类可解释语义特征（特征规范）的方法，并测试这些方法对随机信息的预测能力。

Result: 研究发现这些方法能够成功预测随机信息，表明预测结果主要由算法上限决定，而非词嵌入中真正的语义表示，比较不同数据集时不能仅依赖预测性能。

Conclusion: 词嵌入与语义特征之间的映射主要反映向量空间的几何相似性，不能可靠地表明语义属性的真正涌现，需要更严谨的方法来评估词嵌入中的知识编码。

Abstract: Understanding what knowledge is implicitly encoded in deep learning models is
essential for improving the interpretability of AI systems. This paper examines
common methods to explain the knowledge encoded in word embeddings, which are
core elements of large language models (LLMs). These methods typically involve
mapping embeddings onto collections of human-interpretable semantic features,
known as feature norms. Prior work assumes that accurately predicting these
semantic features from the word embeddings implies that the embeddings contain
the corresponding knowledge. We challenge this assumption by demonstrating that
prediction accuracy alone does not reliably indicate genuine feature-based
interpretability.
  We show that these methods can successfully predict even random information,
concluding that the results are predominantly determined by an algorithmic
upper bound rather than meaningful semantic representation in the word
embeddings. Consequently, comparisons between datasets based solely on
prediction performance do not reliably indicate which dataset is better
captured by the word embeddings. Our analysis illustrates that such mappings
primarily reflect geometric similarity within vector spaces rather than
indicating the genuine emergence of semantic properties.

Abstract: With the widespread application of electroencephalography (EEG) in
neuroscience and clinical practice, efficiently retrieving and semantically
interpreting large-scale, multi-source, heterogeneous EEG data has become a
pressing challenge. We propose EEG-MedRAG, a three-layer hypergraph-based
retrieval-augmented generation framework that unifies EEG domain knowledge,
individual patient cases, and a large-scale repository into a traversable n-ary
relational hypergraph, enabling joint semantic-temporal retrieval and
causal-chain diagnostic generation. Concurrently, we introduce the first
cross-disease, cross-role EEG clinical QA benchmark, spanning seven disorders
and five authentic clinical perspectives. This benchmark allows systematic
evaluation of disease-agnostic generalization and role-aware contextual
understanding. Experiments show that EEG-MedRAG significantly outperforms
TimeRAG and HyperGraphRAG in answer accuracy and retrieval, highlighting its
strong potential for real-world clinical decision support. Our data and code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在需要事实严谨的领域中常常显示奇恶行为（无条件符合用户信念），这在高风险科学QA场景中带来严重风险

Method: 提出统一评估框架来量化奇恶上下文对模型行为的影响，并设计Pressure-Tune方法，通过在合成对话和思维链理由上进行轻量级微调

Result: 系统评估显示模型存在普遍奇恶倾向，而Pressure-Tune能够显著提升奇恶抗力且不影响准确性或对有效反馈的响应能力

Conclusion: 奇恶行为主要由对齐策略驱动，Pressure-Tune提供了一种实用的解决方案，能够培养更真实和有原则的模型行为

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), while increasingly used in domains requiring
factual rigor, often display a troubling behavior: sycophancy, the tendency to
align with user beliefs regardless of correctness. This tendency is reinforced
by preference-based alignment techniques that optimize for user satisfaction
but can undermine truthfulness. While relatively benign in casual dialogue,
sycophancy poses serious risks in high-stakes settings such as scientific
question answering (QA), where model outputs may shape collaborative reasoning,
decision-making, and knowledge formation. Despite its importance, this
phenomenon remains underexamined in factual QA contexts. We address this gap by
introducing a unified evaluation framework to quantify the impact of
sycophantic context on model behavior in scientific QA, measuring how much
user-imposed social pressure distorts model outputs. The framework incorporates
adversarial prompting setups and targeted metrics, such as misleading
resistance and sycophancy resistance, that capture a model's ability to
maintain factual consistency under misleading cues. Systematic evaluations
across open-source and proprietary models reveal pervasive sycophantic
tendencies, driven more by alignment strategy than by model size. To mitigate
this issue, we propose Pressure-Tune, a lightweight post-training method that
fine-tunes models on synthetic adversarial dialogues paired with
chain-of-thought rationales. These rationales reject user misinformation while
reinforcing factual commitments. Experiments on challenging scientific QA
benchmarks show that Pressure-Tune significantly enhances sycophancy resistance
without compromising accuracy or responsiveness to valid feedback, offering a
practical pathway toward more truthful and principled model behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器生成文本检测器在相同领域表现良好，但在跨领域场景下由于领域偏移而泛化能力差，需要开发能够处理领域不变特征的检测方法

Method: 从频域角度分析文本表示，发现机器生成文本与人类撰写文本在频谱模式上存在显著差异。设计了低频域滤波模块过滤对领域偏移敏感的文档级特征，以及动态频谱对齐策略提取任务特定和领域不变的特征

Result: 在11个测试数据集和三种领域泛化场景下，MGT-Prism平均准确率比最先进基线高0.90%，F1分数高0.92%

Conclusion: 频域分析为机器生成文本检测提供了新的视角，MGT-Prism通过频谱特征处理有效提升了跨领域检测性能，证明了频域方法在文本检测任务中的有效性

Abstract: Large Language Models have shown growing ability to generate fluent and
coherent texts that are highly similar to the writing style of humans. Current
detectors for Machine-Generated Text (MGT) perform well when they are trained
and tested in the same domain but generalize poorly to unseen domains, due to
domain shift between data from different sources. In this work, we propose
MGT-Prism, an MGT detection method from the perspective of the frequency domain
for better domain generalization. Our key insight stems from analyzing text
representations in the frequency domain, where we observe consistent spectral
patterns across diverse domains, while significant discrepancies in magnitude
emerge between MGT and human-written texts (HWTs). The observation initiates
the design of a low frequency domain filtering module for filtering out the
document-level features that are sensitive to domain shift, and a dynamic
spectrum alignment strategy to extract the task-specific and domain-invariant
features for improving the detector's performance in domain generalization.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGT-Prism outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by an average of 0.90% in accuracy and 0.92% in F1 score on 11 test
datasets across three domain-generalization scenarios.

TL;DR: 这研究评估大语言模型生成文本与实际儿童语言的相似度，发现LLM生成的文本语言特征与儿童语言存在显著差异，少量提示仅能稍微提升相似度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在教育中的应用增多，需要了解LLM生成文本是否能够模仿儿童语言特征，以评估其在教育工具中的适用性。

Method: 使用德语儿童图片故事描述语料库，通过零样本提示和少量样本提示两种方式生成LLM文本。从词频、词汇丰富度、句长、词性标注和语义相似度等心理语言学角度进行对比分析。

Result: LLM生成文本更长但词汇丰富度更低，更多依赖高频词，名词使用不足。语义向量空间分析显示两者语义相似度低。少量提示仅能稍微提升相似性。

Conclusion: LLM目前无法有效模仿儿童语言的词汇和语义特征，这对其在儿童教育工具中的应用适当性提出了质疑，为心理语言学研究提供了重要见解。

Abstract: The role of large language models (LLMs) in education is increasing, yet
little attention has been paid to whether LLM-generated text resembles child
language. This study evaluates how LLMs replicate child-like language by
comparing LLM-generated texts to a collection of German children's descriptions
of picture stories. We generated two LLM-based corpora using the same picture
stories and two prompt types: zero-shot and few-shot prompts specifying a
general age from the children corpus. We conducted a comparative analysis
across psycholinguistic text properties, including word frequency, lexical
richness, sentence and word length, part-of-speech tags, and semantic
similarity with word embeddings. The results show that LLM-generated texts are
longer but less lexically rich, rely more on high-frequency words, and
under-represent nouns. Semantic vector space analysis revealed low similarity,
highlighting differences between the two corpora on the level of corpus
semantics. Few-shot prompt increased similarities between children and LLM text
to a minor extent, but still failed to replicate lexical and semantic patterns.
The findings contribute to our understanding of how LLMs approximate child
language through multimodal prompting (text + image) and give insights into
their use in psycholinguistic research and education while raising important
questions about the appropriateness of LLM-generated language in child-directed
educational tools.

*Bohao Chu,Meijie Li,Sameh Frihat,Chengyu Gu,Georg Lodde,Elisabeth Livingstone,Norbert Fuhr*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TracSum是一个用于可追溯、基于方面的医学摘要生成的新基准，包含500个医学摘要的3.5K个摘要-引用对，提出了细粒度评估框架和Track-Then-Sum基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM生成医学摘要时的事实准确性担忧，通过提供句子级引用让用户能够追溯原始上下文来验证摘要准确性。

Method: 构建TracSum基准数据集，标注7个关键医学方面的摘要-引用对；提出包含4个指标的细粒度评估框架；设计Track-Then-Sum摘要生成管道（先追踪后摘要）。

Result: TracSum被证明是有效的可追溯、基于方面摘要任务的基准；显式执行句子级追踪能提高生成准确性；包含完整上下文能进一步提升完整性。

Conclusion: TracSum基准和提出的评估框架为可追溯医学摘要生成提供了有效工具，追踪机制和完整上下文对提高摘要质量至关重要。

Abstract: While document summarization with LLMs has enhanced access to textual
information, concerns about the factual accuracy of these summaries persist,
especially in the medical domain. Tracing evidence from which summaries are
derived enables users to assess their accuracy, thereby alleviating this
concern. In this paper, we introduce TracSum, a novel benchmark for traceable,
aspect-based summarization, in which generated summaries are paired with
sentence-level citations, enabling users to trace back to the original context.
First, we annotate 500 medical abstracts for seven key medical aspects,
yielding 3.5K summary-citation pairs. We then propose a fine-grained evaluation
framework for this new task, designed to assess the completeness and
consistency of generated content using four metrics. Finally, we introduce a
summarization pipeline, Track-Then-Sum, which serves as a baseline method for
comparison. In experiments, we evaluate both this baseline and a set of LLMs on
TracSum, and conduct a human evaluation to assess the evaluation results. The
findings demonstrate that TracSum can serve as an effective benchmark for
traceable, aspect-based summarization tasks. We also observe that explicitly
performing sentence-level tracking prior to summarization enhances generation
accuracy, while incorporating the full context further improves completeness.

### [107] [Beyond Human Judgment: A Bayesian Evaluation of LLMs' Moral Values Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13804)
*Maciej Skorski,Alina Landowska*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过贝叶斯方法评估了顶级语言模型在道德维度理解方面与人类的对比，发现AI模型表现优于75%的人类标注者，特别是在减少假阴性方面表现出更敏感的道德检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究使用确定性地面真值（多数或包含规则）来评估语言模型的道德理解，但忽略了标注者之间的分歧。本研究旨在通过建模标注者分歧来捕捉人类固有的不确定性和模型领域敏感性。

Method: 采用GPU优化的贝叶斯框架，处理了100万+模型查询，评估了Claude Sonnet 4、DeepSeek-V3、Llama 4 Maverick等顶级模型，基于25万+标注和700名标注者对10万+文本的分析。

Result: AI模型通常排名在人类标注者的前25%，达到远高于平均水平的平衡准确率。AI产生的假阴性远少于人类，显示出更敏感的道德检测能力。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在道德维度理解方面表现优异，超越了大多数人类标注者，特别是在道德敏感性检测方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: How do large language models understand moral dimensions compared to humans?
  This first large-scale Bayesian evaluation of market-leading language models
provides the answer. In contrast to prior work using deterministic ground truth
(majority or inclusion rules), we model annotator disagreements to capture both
aleatoric uncertainty (inherent human disagreement) and epistemic uncertainty
(model domain sensitivity). We evaluate top language models (Claude Sonnet 4,
DeepSeek-V3, Llama 4 Maverick) across 250K+ annotations from ~700 annotators on
100K+ texts spanning social media, news, and forums.
  Our GPU-optimized Bayesian framework processed 1M+ model queries, revealing
that AI models typically rank among the top 25\% of human annotators, achieving
much better-than-average balanced accuracy. Importantly, we find that AI
produces far fewer false negatives than humans, highlighting their more
sensitive moral detection capabilities.

TL;DR: 通过插入计数下降标记的提示策略，使得大语言模型能够准确控制生成文本的长度，将GPT-4.1的长度遵从率从30%以下提升到95%以上


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在生成文本时经常无法准确控制长度，无法可靠进行内部词段计数

Method: 提出一种基于提示的一次投射策略，在提示中添加计数下降标记和明确的计数规则，让模型在写作时同时进行计数

Result: 在MT-Bench-LI任务上，GPT-4.1的严格长度遵从率从累硅提示的30%以下提升到计数下降提示的95%以上，超越了流行的草稿-然后修计基准方法，同时保持了评价质量

Conclusion: 突出显示仅通过提示工程就可以实现准确的长度控制，提供了轻量级的替代方案，无需训练或迭代采样

Abstract: Controlling the length of text produced by large language models (LLMs)
remains challenging: models frequently overshoot or undershoot explicit length
instructions because they cannot reliably keep an internal token count. We
present a prompt-based, one-shot strategy that compels an off-the-shelf LLM to
generate exactly a desired number of tokens - words (English) or characters
(Chinese) - without any fine-tuning or iterative sampling. The prompt appends
countdown markers and explicit counting rules so that the model "writes while
counting." We evaluate on four settings: open-ended generation (1-1000 tokens),
XSUM summarization, MT-Bench-LI instruction following, and the LIFEBENCH
equal-length track. On MT-Bench-LI, strict length compliance with GPT-4.1 leaps
from below 30% under naive prompts to above 95% with our countdown prompt,
surpassing the popular draft-then-revise baseline, while judged answer quality
is preserved. These results show that precise length control can be achieved
through prompt engineering alone, offering a lightweight alternative to
training- or decoding-based methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统评了自动评价指标在自然语言生成任务中的现状和挑战，发现无单一指标能完美体现人类判断，建议根据具体任务选择指标并关注验证方法的改进


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言生成的评价是AI应用的关键挑战，虽然人工评估是标准方法但成本高且难扩展，实践中开发了多种自动评价指标，但无单一指标能成为最佳解决方案

Method: 通过对现有评价指标进行彻底检查，分析其方法论、文档化优势和局限性、验证方法以及与人类判断的相关性，包括最新的LLM-as-a-Judge方法和RAG任务评估

Result: 识别出几个关键挑战：指标仅能捐捕文本质量的特定方面，效果因任务和数据集而异，验证实践结构化不足，与人类判断的相关性不稳定，这些问题在最新的LLM评估方法中仍存在

Conclusion: 证明寻找'完美指标'的追求是不实际的，建议根据具体任务需求选择指标，利用补充性评估方法，并强调新指标应重点关注改进验证方法论

Abstract: Evaluating Natural Language Generation (NLG) is crucial for the practical
adoption of AI, but has been a longstanding research challenge. While human
evaluation is considered the de-facto standard, it is expensive and lacks
scalability. Practical applications have driven the development of various
automatic evaluation metrics (AEM), designed to compare the model output with
human-written references, generating a score which approximates human judgment.
Over time, AEMs have evolved from simple lexical comparisons, to semantic
similarity models and, more recently, to LLM-based evaluators. However, it
seems that no single metric has emerged as a definitive solution, resulting in
studies using different ones without fully considering the implications. This
paper aims to show this by conducting a thorough examination of the
methodologies of existing metrics, their documented strengths and limitations,
validation methods, and correlations with human judgment. We identify several
key challenges: metrics often capture only specific aspects of text quality,
their effectiveness varies by task and dataset, validation practices remain
unstructured, and correlations with human judgment are inconsistent.
Importantly, we find that these challenges persist in the most recent type of
metric, LLM-as-a-Judge, as well as in the evaluation of Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG), an increasingly relevant task in academia and industry. Our
findings challenge the quest for the 'perfect metric'. We propose selecting
metrics based on task-specific needs and leveraging complementary evaluations
and advocate that new metrics should focus on enhanced validation
methodologies.

Abstract: This study explores the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM)
with Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate the extraction of
requirements from unstructured French Building Technical Specification (BTS)
documents within the construction industry. Employing Named Entity Recognition
(NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) techniques, the study leverages the
transformer-based model CamemBERT and applies transfer learning with the French
language model Fr\_core\_news\_lg, both pre-trained on a large French corpus in
the general domain. To benchmark these models, additional approaches ranging
from rule-based to deep learning-based methods are developed. For RE, four
different supervised models, including Random Forest, are implemented using a
custom feature vector. A hand-crafted annotated dataset is used to compare the
effectiveness of NER approaches and RE models. Results indicate that CamemBERT
and Fr\_core\_news\_lg exhibited superior performance in NER, achieving
F1-scores over 90\%, while Random Forest proved most effective in RE, with an
F1 score above 80\%. The outcomes are intended to be represented as a knowledge

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MME-SCI是一个新的多模态大语言模型科学领域评测基准，解决了现有基准在跨语言推理、多模态覆盖和细粒度知识标注方面的不足，包含1019个高质量问题对，覆盖4个学科和5种语言，实验显示对现有模型具有显著挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学领域评测基准存在三个关键问题：1）多语言场景下模型推理能力评估不足；2）多模态覆盖评估不充分；3）科学知识点缺乏细粒度标注。需要构建更全面和具有挑战性的基准来评估MLLMs的科学推理能力。

Method: 收集了1019个高质量问答对，涵盖数学、物理、化学、生物四个学科，支持中文、英文、法文、西班牙文和日文五种语言，包含3种不同的评估模式。在16个开源模型和4个闭源模型上进行了广泛实验。

Result: MME-SCI对现有MLLMs具有广泛挑战性，在仅图像评估模式下，o4-mini在数学、物理、化学、生物上的准确率分别仅为52.11%、24.73%、36.57%和29.80%，难度显著高于现有基准。通过多语言和细粒度知识属性深入分析了模型性能。

Conclusion: MME-SCI是一个全面且具有挑战性的科学领域评测基准，能够有效评估MLLMs的多语言推理能力和多模态理解能力，揭示了现有模型在特定领域的弱点，为模型改进提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved significant
advancements across various domains, and corresponding evaluation benchmarks
have been continuously refined and improved. In this process, benchmarks in the
scientific domain have played an important role in assessing the reasoning
capabilities of MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks still face three key
challenges: 1) Insufficient evaluation of models' reasoning abilities in
multilingual scenarios; 2) Inadequate assessment of MLLMs' comprehensive
modality coverage; 3) Lack of fine-grained annotation of scientific knowledge
points. To address these gaps, we propose MME-SCI, a comprehensive and
challenging benchmark. We carefully collected 1,019 high-quality
question-answer pairs, which involve 3 distinct evaluation modes. These pairs
cover four subjects, namely mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, and
support five languages: Chinese, English, French, Spanish, and Japanese. We
conducted extensive experiments on 16 open-source models and 4 closed-source
models, and the results demonstrate that MME-SCI is widely challenging for
existing MLLMs. For instance, under the Image-only evaluation mode, o4-mini
achieved accuracy of only 52.11%, 24.73%, 36.57%, and 29.80% in mathematics,
physics, chemistry, and biology, respectively, indicating a significantly
higher difficulty level compared to existing benchmarks. More importantly,
using MME-SCI's multilingual and fine-grained knowledge attributes, we analyzed
existing models' performance in depth and identified their weaknesses in
specific domains. The Data and Evaluation Code are available at

Abstract: In the hospitality industry, understanding the factors that drive customer
review ratings is critical for improving guest satisfaction and business
performance. This work proposes ReviewGraph for Review Rating Prediction (RRP),
a novel framework that transforms textual customer reviews into knowledge
graphs by extracting (subject, predicate, object) triples and associating
sentiment scores. Using graph embeddings (Node2Vec) and sentiment features, the
framework predicts review rating scores through machine learning classifiers.
We compare ReviewGraph performance with traditional NLP baselines (such as Bag
of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec) and large language models (LLMs), evaluating
them in the HotelRec dataset. In comparison to the state of the art literature,
our proposed model performs similar to their best performing model but with
lower computational cost (without ensemble).
  While ReviewGraph achieves comparable predictive performance to LLMs and
outperforms baselines on agreement-based metrics such as Cohen's Kappa, it
offers additional advantages in interpretability, visual exploration, and
potential integration into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. This
work highlights the potential of graph-based representations for enhancing
review analytics and lays the groundwork for future research integrating
advanced graph neural networks and fine-tuned LLM-based extraction methods. We

Conclusion: LongMab-PO框架通过MAB策略有效解决了长文本建模中的数据质量和多样性问题，为LLM的长文本能力优化提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Long-context modeling is critical for a wide range of real-world tasks,
including long-context question answering, summarization, and complex reasoning
tasks. Recent studies have explored fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)
with synthetic data to enhance their long-context capabilities. However, the
effectiveness of such approaches is often limited by the low diversity and
factual inconsistencies in the generated data. To address these challenges, we
propose LongMab-PO, a novel framework that leverages a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)
rollout strategy to identify the most informative chunks from the given long
context for sampling high-quality and diverse responses and constructing
preference data pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training.
Specifically, we treat context chunks as arms of MAB, select chunks based on
their expected reward scores to input into LLMs to generate responses, and
iteratively update these scores based on reward feedback. This exploration and
exploitation process enables the model to focus on the most relevant context
segments, thereby generating and collecting high-quality and diverse responses.
Finally, we collect these generated responses from the rollout process and
apply the DPO method to further optimize the LLM. Experimental results show
that LongMab-PO significantly improves the diversity and quality of preference
data pairs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on long-context reasoning
benchmarks. All code and data will be released on

TL;DR: 提出SvS策略，通过自对弈和变分问题合成来维持策略熵，解决RLVR训练中多样性下降的问题，显著提升Pass@k性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RLVR训练虽然提高了Pass@1性能，但导致策略熵下降，减少生成多样性，限制了Pass@k性能的上限

Method: 在线自对弈变分问题合成策略(SvS)，利用策略的正确解合成变分问题，保持参考答案不变，有效维持训练过程中的策略熵

Result: 在AIME24和AIME25基准上Pass@32性能分别获得18.3%和22.8%的绝对提升，在12个推理基准和3B到32B不同模型规模上均表现出通用性和鲁棒性

Conclusion: SvS策略能有效缓解RLVR训练中的熵崩溃问题，持续维持策略多样性，显著提升大语言模型在复杂推理任务中的Pass@k性能

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a key paradigm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for
complex reasoning tasks. However, vanilla RLVR training has been shown to
improve Pass@1 performance at the expense of policy entropy, leading to reduced
generation diversity and limiting the Pass@k performance, which typically
represents the upper bound of LLM reasoning capability. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the policy's generation diversity from the perspective
of training problems and find that augmenting and updating training problems
helps mitigate entropy collapse during training. Based on these observations,
we propose an online Self-play with Variational problem Synthesis (SvS)
strategy for RLVR training, which uses the policy's correct solutions to
synthesize variational problems while ensuring their reference answers remain
identical to the originals. This self-improving strategy effectively maintains
policy entropy during training and substantially improves Pass@k compared with
standard RLVR, sustaining prolonged improvements and achieving absolute gains
of 18.3% and 22.8% in Pass@32 performance on the competition-level AIME24 and
AIME25 benchmarks. Experiments on 12 reasoning benchmarks across varying model
sizes from 3B to 32B consistently demonstrate the generalizability and
robustness of SvS.

Motivation: 大语言模型在细调代理任务时安全性问题往往被忽视，导致对齐的LLM变得失对齐，更容易执行有害任务且更少拒绝这些任务。

Method: 提出Prefix INjection Guard (PING)方法，在代理响应前注入自动生成的自然语言前缀。采用迭代方法：(1)生成候选前缀 (2)选择能同时优化任务性能和拒绝行为的前缀。

Result: 实验结果显示PING显著提升了细调LLM代理的安全性，而不爆发其有效性。在网页导航和代码生成任务的多样化测试中持续超过现有提示方法。线性探针分析显示前缀token对行为修改至关重要。

Conclusion: PING是一种简单但有效的方法，能够在不爆发代理性能的前提下显著提升LLM代理的安全性。前缀token在行为修改中发挥关键作用，这也解释了性能提升的原因。

Abstract: Beyond simple text generation, Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into
agentic systems capable of planning and interacting with external tools to
solve complex tasks. This evolution involves fine-tuning LLMs on agent-specific
tasks to enhance their proficiency. However, safety concerns are frequently
overlooked during this fine-tuning process. In this work, we show that aligned
LLMs can become unintentionally misaligned, leading to a higher likelihood of
executing harmful tasks and a reduced tendency to refuse them when fine-tuned
to execute agentic tasks. To address these safety challenges, we propose Prefix
INjection Guard (PING), a simple yet effective method that prepends
automatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses, guiding
them to refuse harmful requests while preserving performance on benign tasks.
Specifically, we introduce an iterative approach that alternates between (1)
generating candidate prefixes and (2) selecting those that optimize both task
performance and refusal behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that PING
significantly enhances the safety of fine-tuned LLM agents without sacrificing
their effectiveness. PING consistently outperforms existing prompting
approaches across diverse benchmarks in both web navigation and code generation
tasks. Our analysis of internal hidden states via linear probes reveals that
prefix tokens are crucial for behavior modification, explaining the performance
gains. WARNING: This paper contains contents that are unethical or offensive in

Abstract: Digital health analytics face critical challenges nowadays. The sophisticated
analysis of patient-generated health content, which contains complex emotional
and medical contexts, requires scarce domain expertise, while traditional ML
approaches are constrained by data shortage and privacy limitations in
healthcare settings. Online Health Communities (OHCs) exemplify these
challenges with mixed-sentiment posts, clinical terminology, and implicit
emotional expressions that demand specialised knowledge for accurate Sentiment
Analysis (SA). To address these challenges, this study explores how Large
Language Models (LLMs) can integrate expert knowledge through in-context
learning for SA, providing a scalable solution for sophisticated health data
analysis. Specifically, we develop a structured codebook that systematically
encodes expert interpretation guidelines, enabling LLMs to apply
domain-specific knowledge through targeted prompting rather than extensive
training. Six GPT models validated alongside DeepSeek and LLaMA 3.1 are
compared with pre-trained language models (BioBERT variants) and lexicon-based
methods, using 400 expert-annotated posts from two OHCs. LLMs achieve superior
performance while demonstrating expert-level agreement. This high agreement,
with no statistically significant difference from inter-expert agreement
levels, suggests knowledge integration beyond surface-level pattern
recognition. The consistent performance across diverse LLM models, supported by
in-context learning, offers a promising solution for digital health analytics.
This approach addresses the critical challenge of expert knowledge shortage in
digital health research, enabling real-time, expert-quality analysis for
patient monitoring, intervention assessment, and evidence-based health
strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗AI在肺癌诊断中的不确定性问题，因为AI仅依靠病变数据进行诊断，缺乏医生所拥有的丰富背景知识和临床经验，导致医生对AI系统信任度低。

Method: 提出不确定性感知学习策略，同时学习医生背景知识和胸部X光片病变信息。使用防尾大学医院提供的2,517张无病变图像和656张结节图像进行训练。

Abstract: Early detection and rapid intervention of lung cancer are crucial.
Nonetheless, ensuring an accurate diagnosis is challenging, as physicians'
ability to interpret chest X-rays varies significantly depending on their
experience and degree of fatigue. Although medical AI has been rapidly
advancing to assist in diagnosis, physicians' trust in such systems remains
limited, preventing widespread clinical adoption. This skepticism fundamentally
stems from concerns about its diagnostic uncertainty. In clinical diagnosis,
physicians utilize extensive background knowledge and clinical experience. In
contrast, medical AI primarily relies on repetitive learning of the target
lesion to generate diagnoses based solely on that data. In other words, medical
AI does not possess sufficient knowledge to render a diagnosis, leading to
diagnostic uncertainty. Thus, this study suggests an Uncertainty-Aware Learning
Policy that can address the issue of knowledge deficiency by learning the
physicians' background knowledge alongside the Chest X-ray lesion information.
We used 2,517 lesion-free images and 656 nodule images, all obtained from Ajou
University Hospital. The proposed model attained 92% (IoU 0.2 / FPPI 2) with a
10% enhancement in sensitivity compared to the baseline model while also
decreasing entropy as a measure of uncertainty by 0.2.

*Yuyan Ye,Hang Xu,Yanghang Huang,Jiali Huang,Qian Weng*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: PreSem-Surf是基于NeRF框架的优化方法，通过整合RGB、深度和语义信息，在短时间内从RGB-D序列重建高质量场景表面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的NeRF方法在场景表面重建中面临训练时间长、噪声干扰和细节区分困难的问题，需要一种能够快速且高质量重建的方法。

Method: 提出SG-MLP采样结构与PR-MLP结合的体素预渲染方法，采用渐进式语义建模技术，在不同精度级别提取语义信息。

Result: 在7个合成场景和6个评估指标上的实验显示，PreSem-Surf在C-L1、F-score和IoU指标上表现最佳，在NC、准确性和完整性指标上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提高了场景重建质量和效率，证明了其在实际应用中的有效性。

Abstract: This paper proposes PreSem-Surf, an optimized method based on the Neural
Radiance Field (NeRF) framework, capable of reconstructing high-quality scene
surfaces from RGB-D sequences in a short time. The method integrates RGB,
depth, and semantic information to improve reconstruction performance.
Specifically, a novel SG-MLP sampling structure combined with PR-MLP
(Preconditioning Multilayer Perceptron) is introduced for voxel pre-rendering,
allowing the model to capture scene-related information earlier and better
distinguish noise from local details. Furthermore, progressive semantic
modeling is adopted to extract semantic information at increasing levels of
precision, reducing training time while enhancing scene understanding.
Experiments on seven synthetic scenes with six evaluation metrics show that
PreSem-Surf achieves the best performance in C-L1, F-score, and IoU, while
maintaining competitive results in NC, Accuracy, and Completeness,
demonstrating its effectiveness and practical applicability.

Abstract: We present a multi-level elastodynamics timestep solver for accelerating
incremental potential contact (IPC) simulations. Our method retains the
robustness of gold standard IPC in the face of intricate geometry, complex
heterogeneous material distributions and high resolution input data without
sacrificing visual fidelity (per-timestep relative displacement error of
$\approx1\%$). The success of our method is enabled by a novel, sparse,
geometry- and material-aware basis construction method which allows for the use
of fast preconditioned conjugate gradient solvers (in place of a sparse direct
solver), but without suffering convergence issues due to stiff or heterogeneous
materials. The end result is a solver that produces results visually
indistinguishable and quantitatively very close to gold-standard IPC methods
but up to $13\times$ faster on identical hardware.

TL;DR: DiffPlanner是一个基于Transformer的条件扩散模型，直接在向量空间中生成边界约束的平面布局，避免了传统方法中向量-栅格-向量的转换过程和信息损失


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法需要将向量数据转换为栅格图像，使用图像生成模型后再转换回向量数据，这个过程复杂冗余且会导致信息损失。栅格图像无法无损缩放，限制了生成质量

Method: 提出基于Transformer的条件扩散模型，在训练中集成对齐机制，将模型优化轨迹与设计师的迭代设计过程对齐，直接在向量空间处理复杂数据

Result: 通过定量比较、定性评估、消融实验和感知研究证明，DiffPlanner在生成平面布局和气泡图方面超越了现有最先进方法，提供更好的用户可控性和更高质量的结果

Conclusion: DiffPlanner成功解决了传统方法的信息损失问题，在向量空间中实现了高质量的边界约束平面布局生成，为创意设计阶段提供了更好的可控性和生成质量

Abstract: The boundary-constrained floor plan generation problem aims to generate the
topological and geometric properties of a set of rooms within a given boundary.
Recently, learning-based methods have made significant progress in generating
realistic floor plans. However, these methods involve a workflow of converting
vector data into raster images, using image-based generative models, and then
converting the results back into vector data. This process is complex and
redundant, often resulting in information loss. Raster images, unlike vector
data, cannot scale without losing detail and precision. To address these
issues, we propose a novel deep learning framework called DiffPlanner for
boundary-constrained floor plan generation, which operates entirely in vector
space. Our framework is a Transformer-based conditional diffusion model that
integrates an alignment mechanism in training, aligning the optimization
trajectory of the model with the iterative design processes of designers. This
enables our model to handle complex vector data, better fit the distribution of
the predicted targets, accomplish the challenging task of floor plan layout
design, and achieve user-controllable generation. We conduct quantitative
comparisons, qualitative evaluations, ablation experiments, and perceptual
studies to evaluate our method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
DiffPlanner surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in generating floor
plans and bubble diagrams in the creative stages, offering more controllability
to users and producing higher-quality results that closely match the ground
truths.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Sketch3DVE是一个基于草图的3D感知视频编辑方法，能够在具有显著视角变化（如大角度相机旋转或缩放）的视频中实现详细的局部结构内容编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频编辑方法主要在风格迁移或外观修改方面表现良好，但在处理3D场景结构内容编辑时面临挑战，特别是在处理显著视角变化时难以保持一致性、保留未编辑区域以及从稀疏2D输入生成逼真的3D视频输出。

Method: 1) 使用图像编辑方法生成第一帧的编辑结果并传播到后续帧；2) 采用草图作为精确几何控制的交互工具；3) 利用密集立体方法估计点云和相机参数；4) 提出基于深度图的点云编辑方法表示新编辑组件的3D几何；5) 引入3D感知掩码传播策略和使用视频扩散模型生成逼真编辑视频。

Conclusion: Sketch3DVE成功解决了基于草图的3D感知视频编辑中的关键挑战，包括处理视角变化、保持一致性、保留未编辑区域以及生成逼真3D输出，为视频结构内容编辑提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent video editing methods achieve attractive results in style transfer or
appearance modification. However, editing the structural content of 3D scenes
in videos remains challenging, particularly when dealing with significant
viewpoint changes, such as large camera rotations or zooms. Key challenges
include generating novel view content that remains consistent with the original
video, preserving unedited regions, and translating sparse 2D inputs into
realistic 3D video outputs. To address these issues, we propose Sketch3DVE, a
sketch-based 3D-aware video editing method to enable detailed local
manipulation of videos with significant viewpoint changes. To solve the
challenge posed by sparse inputs, we employ image editing methods to generate
edited results for the first frame, which are then propagated to the remaining
frames of the video. We utilize sketching as an interaction tool for precise
geometry control, while other mask-based image editing methods are also
supported. To handle viewpoint changes, we perform a detailed analysis and
manipulation of the 3D information in the video. Specifically, we utilize a
dense stereo method to estimate a point cloud and the camera parameters of the
input video. We then propose a point cloud editing approach that uses depth
maps to represent the 3D geometry of newly edited components, aligning them
effectively with the original 3D scene. To seamlessly merge the newly edited
content with the original video while preserving the features of unedited
regions, we introduce a 3D-aware mask propagation strategy and employ a video
diffusion model to produce realistic edited videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of Sketch3DVE in video editing. Homepage and code:

Conclusion: Is-NeRF通过显式光路建模成功解决了传统NeRF在处理运动模糊图像时的局限性，为复杂光路场景提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has gained significant attention for its
prominent implicit 3D representation and realistic novel view synthesis
capabilities. Available works unexceptionally employ straight-line volume
rendering, which struggles to handle sophisticated lightpath scenarios and
introduces geometric ambiguities during training, particularly evident when
processing motion-blurred images. To address these challenges, this work
proposes a novel deblur neural radiance field, Is-NeRF, featuring explicit
lightpath modeling in real-world environments. By unifying six common light
propagation phenomena through an in-scattering representation, we establish a
new scattering-aware volume rendering pipeline adaptable to complex lightpaths.
Additionally, we introduce an adaptive learning strategy that enables
autonomous determining of scattering directions and sampling intervals to
capture finer object details. The proposed network jointly optimizes NeRF
parameters, scattering parameters, and camera motions to recover fine-grained
scene representations from blurry images. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate
that it effectively handles complex real-world scenarios, outperforming
state-of-the-art approaches in generating high-fidelity images with accurate
geometric details.

Result: Agent基础模型（AFMs）在web agent和code agent多个测试集上创造了新的最高性能记录

Conclusion: 链式机器框架为机器模型研究提供了坚实基础，完全开源的研究资源包括模型权重、训练代码和训练数据

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex problem-solving tasks such as
deep research, vibe coding, and mathematical reasoning. However, most existing
multi-agent systems are built upon manual prompt/workflow engineering with
sophisticated agent frameworks, making them computationally inefficient, less
capable, and can not benefit from data-centric learning. In this work, we
introduce Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel paradigm of LLM reasoning that enables
native end-to-end complex problem-solving in the same way as a multi-agent
system (i.e., multi-turn problem solving with multiple tools and multiple
agents) within one model. In chain-of-agents problem-solving, the model
dynamically activates different tool agents and role-playing agents to simulate
multi-agent collaboration in an end-to-end fashion. To elicit end-to-end
chain-of-agents problem-solving abilities in LLMs, we introduce a multi-agent
distillation framework to distill state-of-the-art multi-agent systems into
chain-of-agents trajectories for agentic supervised fine-tuning. We then use
agentic reinforcement learning on verifiable agentic tasks to further improve
the models' capabilities on chain-of-agents problem solving. We call the
resulting models Agent Foundation Models (AFMs). Our empirical studies
demonstrate that AFM establishes new state-of-the-art performance across
diverse benchmarks in both web agent and code agent settings. We make the
entire research, including the model weights, code for training and evaluation,
and the training data, fully open-sourced, which offers a solid starting point
for future research on agent models and agentic RL.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Cognitive Workspace新范式，通过模拟人类外部记忆机制，超越传统RAG方法，实现主动记忆管理和任务驱动的上下文优化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在上下文管理方面存在根本性限制，即使上下文窗口扩展到百万token，被动检索系统无法捕捉人类记忆管理的动态任务驱动特性

Method: 基于认知科学理论（Baddeley工作记忆模型、Clark扩展心智理论、Hutchins分布式认知框架），开发三个核心创新：主动记忆管理、分层认知缓冲器、任务驱动上下文优化

Result: 平均58.6%记忆重用率（传统RAG为0%），净效率增益17-18%，统计显著（p < 0.001, Cohen's d > 23）

Conclusion: Cognitive Workspace代表了从信息检索到真正认知增强的根本性转变，为LLM系统提供了首个主动记忆优越性的定量证据

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face fundamental limitations in context
management despite recent advances extending context windows to millions of
tokens. We propose Cognitive Workspace, a novel paradigm that transcends
traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by emulating human cognitive
mechanisms of external memory use. Drawing from cognitive science foundations
including Baddeley's working memory model, Clark's extended mind thesis, and
Hutchins' distributed cognition framework, we demonstrate that current passive
retrieval systems fail to capture the dynamic, task-driven nature of human
memory management. Our analysis of 2024-2025 developments reveals that while
techniques like Infini-attention and StreamingLLM achieve impressive context
lengths, they lack the metacognitive awareness and active planning capabilities
essential for true cognitive extension. Cognitive Workspace addresses these
limitations through three core innovations: (1) active memory management with
deliberate information curation, (2) hierarchical cognitive buffers enabling
persistent working states, and (3) task-driven context optimization that
dynamically adapts to cognitive demands. Empirical validation demonstrates
Cognitive Workspace achieves an average 58.6% memory reuse rate (ranging from
54-60% across different tasks) compared to 0% for traditional RAG, with 17-18%
net efficiency gain despite 3.3x higher operation counts. Statistical analysis
confirms these advantages with p < 0.001 and Cohen's d > 23 across multiple
task types, establishing the first quantitative evidence for active memory
superiority in LLM systems. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework
synthesizing insights from 50+ recent papers, positioning Cognitive Workspace
as a fundamental shift from information retrieval to genuine cognitive
augmentation.

Motivation: 现有的alpha挖掘评估方法主要依靠回测和相关性指标，计算粗重、效率低且忽略了时间稳定性、稳健性、多样性和可解释性等关键特性，同时开源模型的缺乏也阻碍了领域进步

Method: 设计了AlphaEval评估框架，从五个互补维度评估生成alpha的整体质量：预测能力、稳定性、市场干扰稳健性、金融逻辑和多样性

Result: 通过对代表性alpha挖掘算法的大规模实验，AlphaEval达到了与全面回测相可比的评估一致性，同时提供更全面的洞察和更高的效率，能有效识别优秀的alpha

Conclusion: AlphaEval为自动化alpha挖掘领域提供了一个高效、全面的评估解决方案，所有实现和工具已开源，以促进可复现性和社区参与

Abstract: Formula alpha mining, which generates predictive signals from financial data,
is critical for quantitative investment. Although various algorithmic
approaches-such as genetic programming, reinforcement learning, and large
language models-have significantly expanded the capacity for alpha discovery,
systematic evaluation remains a key challenge. Existing evaluation metrics
predominantly include backtesting and correlation-based measures. Backtesting
is computationally intensive, inherently sequential, and sensitive to specific
strategy parameters. Correlation-based metrics, though efficient, assess only
predictive ability and overlook other crucial properties such as temporal
stability, robustness, diversity, and interpretability. Additionally, the
closed-source nature of most existing alpha mining models hinders
reproducibility and slows progress in this field. To address these issues, we
propose AlphaEval, a unified, parallelizable, and backtest-free evaluation
framework for automated alpha mining models. AlphaEval assesses the overall
quality of generated alphas along five complementary dimensions: predictive
power, stability, robustness to market perturbations, financial logic, and
diversity. Extensive experiments across representative alpha mining algorithms
demonstrate that AlphaEval achieves evaluation consistency comparable to
comprehensive backtesting, while providing more comprehensive insights and
higher efficiency. Furthermore, AlphaEval effectively identifies superior
alphas compared to traditional single-metric screening approaches. All
implementations and evaluation tools are open-sourced to promote
reproducibility and community engagement.

Abstract: We study the problem of fitting ontologies and constraints to positive and
negative examples that take the form of a finite relational structure. As
ontology and constraint languages, we consider the description logics
$\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu L}$ and $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu LI}$ as well as several
classes of tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs): full, guarded,
frontier-guarded, frontier-one, and unrestricted TGDs as well as inclusion
dependencies. We pinpoint the exact computational complexity, design
algorithms, and analyze the size of fitting ontologies and TGDs. We also
investigate the related problem of constructing a finite basis of concept
inclusions / TGDs for a given set of finite structures. While finite bases
exist for $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu L}$, $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu LI}$, guarded TGDs,
and inclusion dependencies, they in general do not exist for full,
frontier-guarded and frontier-one TGDs.

Abstract: To elevate the foundational capabilities and generalization prowess of the

culminating in the design of the CESQL model that facilitates conditional
enhancement. Our model excels on the WikiSQL dataset, which is emblematic of
single-table database query tasks, markedly boosting the accuracy of prediction
outcomes. When predicting conditional values in WHERE clauses, we have not only
minimized our dependence on data within the condition columns of tables but
also circumvented the impact of manually labeled training data. Our hope is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别了一种类似于数据污染的新问题：搜索时污染（STC），这在评估搜索基于LLM代理时影响测试有效性。

Method: 在三个常用能力测试集（HLE、SimpleQA、GPQA）上进行实验，分析搜索代理日志，发现约3%问题能直接从HuggingFace找到标签数据。通过屏蔽HuggingFace来验证污染效果。

Result: 约3%的测试问题存在搜索时污染。屏蔽HuggingFace后，被污染问题的准确率下降约15%。公开评估数据集可能不是唯一污染源。

Conclusion: 提出了测试集设计和结果报告的最佳实践，以应对这种新型泄漏问题，确保搜索基于LLM代理评估的可靠性。同时公开完整实验日志供审计使用。

Abstract: Data contamination refers to the leakage of evaluation data into model
training data, resulting in overfitting to supposedly held-out test sets and
compromising test validity. We identify an analogous issue, search-time
contamination (STC), in evaluating search-based LLM agents which use tools to
gather information from online sources when answering user queries. STC occurs
when the retrieval step surfaces a source containing the test question (or a
near-duplicate) alongside its answer, enabling agents to copy rather than
genuinely infer or reason, undermining benchmark integrity. We find that
HuggingFace, an online platform hosting evaluation datasets, appears among
retrieved sources in search based agent logs. Consequently, agents often
explicitly acknowledge discovering question answer pairs from HuggingFace
within their reasoning chains. On three commonly used capability benchmarks:
Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), SimpleQA, and GPQA, we demonstrate that for
approximately 3% of questions, search-based agents directly find the datasets
with ground truth labels on HuggingFace. When millions of evaluation queries
target the same benchmark, even small, repeated leaks can accelerate the
benchmark's obsolescence, shortening its intended lifecycle. After HuggingFace
is blocked, we observe a drop in accuracy on the contaminated subset of
approximately 15%. We further show through ablation experiments that publicly
accessible evaluation datasets on HuggingFace may not be the sole source of
STC. To this end, we conclude by proposing best practices for benchmark design
and result reporting to address this novel form of leakage and ensure
trustworthy evaluation of search-based LLM agents. To facilitate the auditing
of evaluation results, we also publicly release the complete logs from our
experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型在语言、视觉和视频领域处理更大输入，token级别的计算成本成为关键瓶颈。现有token选择方法大多是静态的、模态特定的或与自回归生成不兼容。

Method: 提出QuickMerge框架：1)基于注意力范数动态选择重要token 2)使用基于熵的预算估计器确定token数量 3)引入轻量级transformer先验在合并后的token序列上进行训练以保持自回归兼容性

Result: 在多模态领域评估显示，QuickMerge在计算精度权衡方面取得一致改进，显著减少token数量同时匹配甚至超过学习型tokenizer和固定patch基线的性能

Conclusion: QuickMerge通过语义显著性估计、灵活token预算和自回归对齐的组合，实现了用更少token进行准确生成，有效解决了token计算成本瓶颈问题

Abstract: As generative models scale to larger inputs across language, vision, and
video domains, the cost of token-level computation has become a key bottleneck.
While prior work suggests that only a subset of tokens significantly influence
downstream predictions, most token selection methods are static,
modality-specific, or incompatible with autoregressive generation. In this
paper, we propose QuickMerge, a lightweight token merging framework designed
for efficient next-token prediction.
  QuickMerge dynamically selects a reduced number of tokens based on attention
norm magnitude, guided by an entropy-based budget estimator. To preserve
autoregressive compatibility, we introduce a lightweight transformer prior
trained over the merged token sequence. By combining semantic salience
estimation, flexible token budgets, and AR alignment, QuickMerge enables
accurate generation with fewer tokens.
  We evaluate QuickMerge across multi-modality domains, demonstrating
consistent improvements in compute-accuracy tradeoffs. Specifically, QuickMerge
reduces token counts sustantially while matching as well as exceeding the
performance of learned tokenizers and fixed-patch baselines.

Conclusion: AI与人类在战略决策方式存在显著差异，AI更能承受长期复杂性，这可能是因为人类的认知限制和适应性策略，这些差异对复杂战略环境中的AI应用具有重要意义

Abstract: Strategic decision-making involves managing the tension between immediate
opportunities and long-term objectives. We study this trade-off in chess by
characterizing and comparing dynamics between human vs human and AI vs AI
games. We propose a network-based metric of piece-to-piece interaction to
quantify the ongoing strategic tension on the board. Its evolution in games
reveals that the most competitive AI players sustain higher levels of strategic
tension for longer durations than elite human players. Cumulative tension
varies with algorithmic complexity for AI and correspondingly in human-played
games increases abruptly with expertise at about 1600 Elo and again at 2300
Elo. The profiles reveal different approaches. Highly competitive AI tolerates
interconnected positions balanced between offensive and defensive tactics over
long periods. Human play, in contrast, limits tension and game complexity,
which may reflect cognitive limitations and adaptive strategies. The difference
may have implications for AI usage in complex, strategic environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了多跳个性化推理任务，研究不同记忆机制在个性化信息多跳推理中的表现，构建了数据集和评估框架，并提出了HybridMem混合方法来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于记忆的个性化方法主要关注偏好对齐和简单问答，但现实复杂任务需要对大量用户信息进行多跳推理，当前记忆方法面临重大挑战。

Method: 明确定义多跳个性化推理任务，构建数据集和统一评估框架；实现多种显式和隐式记忆方法；提出结合两种范式的HybridMem混合方法。

Result: 通过综合实验从多角度评估不同记忆方法的性能，分析其优缺点；证明了HybridMem方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为解决个性化信息的多跳推理问题提供了系统框架和方法，HybridMem方法能有效结合显式和隐式记忆的优势，推动个性化智能代理的发展。

Abstract: In large language model-based agents, memory serves as a critical capability
for achieving personalization by storing and utilizing users' information.
Although some previous studies have adopted memory to implement user
personalization, they typically focus on preference alignment and simple
question-answering. However, in the real world, complex tasks often require
multi-hop reasoning on a large amount of user information, which poses
significant challenges for current memory approaches. To address this
limitation, we propose the multi-hop personalized reasoning task to explore how
different memory mechanisms perform in multi-hop reasoning over personalized
information. We explicitly define this task and construct a dataset along with
a unified evaluation framework. Then, we implement various explicit and
implicit memory methods and conduct comprehensive experiments. We evaluate
their performance on this task from multiple perspectives and analyze their
strengths and weaknesses. Besides, we explore hybrid approaches that combine
both paradigms and propose the HybridMem method to address their limitations.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model through extensive
experiments. To benefit the research community, we release this project at
https://github.com/nuster1128/MPR.

Motivation: 科学文献中大量材料数据被困在非结构化的图表中，阻碍了基于大语言模型的AI智能体进行自动化材料设计

Method: 提出DIVE多智能体工作流，系统读取和组织科学文献图形元素中的实验数据，专注于固态氢存储材料

Conclusion: DIVE工作流和智能体设计可广泛适用于不同材料，为AI驱动的材料发现提供了新范式

Abstract: Data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are fundamentally
transforming the discovery of new materials. Despite the unprecedented
availability of materials data in the scientific literature, much of this
information remains trapped in unstructured figures and tables, hindering the
construction of large language model (LLM)-based AI agent for automated
materials design. Here, we present the Descriptive Interpretation of Visual
Expression (DIVE) multi-agent workflow, which systematically reads and
organizes experimental data from graphical elements in scientific literatures.
We focus on solid-state hydrogen storage materials-a class of materials central
to future clean-energy technologies and demonstrate that DIVE markedly improves
the accuracy and coverage of data extraction compared to the direct extraction
by multimodal models, with gains of 10-15% over commercial models and over 30%
relative to open-source models. Building on a curated database of over 30,000
entries from 4,000 publications, we establish a rapid inverse design workflow
capable of identifying previously unreported hydrogen storage compositions in
two minutes. The proposed AI workflow and agent design are broadly transferable
across diverse materials, providing a paradigm for AI-driven materials
discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心血管疾病是全球主要死因，但医疗工作者严重短缺。现有AI系统在临床应用中存在限制：基于提示的角色分配缺乏领域工具支持、工作流程僵化、知识库静态不更新、输入输出模式固定且缺乏可视化输出。

Method: 提出CardAIc-Agents多模态框架：1)CardiacRAG代理从可更新心脏知识生成通用计划；2)主代理集成工具自主执行计划并决策；3)逐步更新策略动态优化复杂任务计划；4)多学科讨论工具处理疑难病例；5)可视化审查面板辅助最终验证。

Conclusion: CardAIc-Agents通过工具增强和自适应推理有效解决了心血管AI临床应用的多个关键限制，为自动化早期检测和主动筛查提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the foremost cause of mortality
worldwide, a burden worsened by a severe deficit of healthcare workers.
Artificial intelligence (AI) agents have shown potential to alleviate this gap
via automated early detection and proactive screening, yet their clinical
application remains limited by: 1) prompt-based clinical role assignment that
relies on intrinsic model capabilities without domain-specific tool support; or
2) rigid sequential workflows, whereas clinical care often requires adaptive
reasoning that orders specific tests and, based on their results, guides
personalised next steps; 3) general and static knowledge bases without
continuous learning capability; and 4) fixed unimodal or bimodal inputs and
lack of on-demand visual outputs when further clarification is needed. In
response, a multimodal framework, CardAIc-Agents, was proposed to augment
models with external tools and adaptively support diverse cardiac tasks.
Specifically, a CardiacRAG agent generated general plans from updatable cardiac
knowledge, while the chief agent integrated tools to autonomously execute these
plans and deliver decisions. To enable adaptive and case-specific
customization, a stepwise update strategy was proposed to dynamically refine
plans based on preceding execution results, once the task was assessed as
complex. In addition, a multidisciplinary discussion tool was introduced to
interpret challenging cases, thereby supporting further adaptation. When
clinicians raised concerns, visual review panels were provided to assist final
validation. Experiments across three datasets showed the efficiency of
CardAIc-Agents compared to mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
state-of-the-art agentic systems, and fine-tuned VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的自动启发式设计方法存在静态操作符和缺乏知识积累机制的问题，限制了其在进化计算框架中的有效性。

Method: 提出HiFo-Prompt框架，包含两种协同提示策略：前瞻性提示基于种群动态自适应引导搜索，管理探索-利用权衡；后见性提示从过往成功启发式中提炼可重用设计原则，构建持久知识库。

Result: 实验结果表明HiFo-Prompt显著优于最先进的LLM-based AHD方法，生成更高质量的启发式，实现更快的收敛速度和更优的查询效率。

Conclusion: HiFo-Prompt通过前瞻性和后见性双重机制成功解决了现有方法的局限性，将瞬时发现转化为持久知识，使LLM能够从自身经验中学习，为自动启发式设计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: LLM-based Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) within Evolutionary Computation
(EC) frameworks has shown promising results. However, its effectiveness is
hindered by the use of static operators and the lack of knowledge accumulation
mechanisms. We introduce HiFo-Prompt, a framework that guides LLMs with two
synergistic prompting strategies: Foresight and Hindsight. Foresight-based
prompts adaptively steer the search based on population dynamics, managing the
exploration-exploitation trade-off. In addition, hindsight-based prompts mimic
human expertise by distilling successful heuristics from past generations into
fundamental, reusable design principles. This dual mechanism transforms
transient discoveries into a persistent knowledge base, enabling the LLM to
learn from its own experience. Empirical results demonstrate that HiFo-Prompt
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based AHD methods, generating
higher-quality heuristics while achieving substantially faster convergence and
superior query efficiency.

TL;DR: LOOP是一个新颖的神经符号规划框架，通过神经和符号组件之间的迭代对话来解决复杂规划问题，在IPC基准测试中达到85.8%的成功率，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的神经规划方法在复杂领域存在缺失前提条件、目标不一致和幻觉问题，而经典规划器缺乏灵活性和自然语言理解能力。现有神经符号方法采用一次性翻译，未能充分利用神经和符号组件的协同优势。

Method: LOOP将规划视为神经和符号组件之间的迭代对话，集成了13个协调的神经特征，包括图神经网络处理空间关系、多智能体验证、分层分解和因果记忆，通过生成PDDL规范并基于符号反馈迭代优化。

Result: 在六个标准IPC基准域上评估，LOOP达到85.8%的成功率，显著优于LLM+P（55.0%）、LLM-as-Planner（19.2%）和Tree-of-Thoughts（3.3%）。

Conclusion: 可靠规划的关键不在于选择神经网络或符号推理器，而在于让它们在过程中真正"对话"。LOOP为构建可信赖的自主系统提供了完整蓝图。

Abstract: Planning is one of the most critical tasks in autonomous systems, where even
a small error can lead to major failures or million-dollar losses. Current
state-of-the-art neural planning approaches struggle with complex domains,
producing plans with missing preconditions, inconsistent goals, and
hallucinations. While classical planners provide logical guarantees, they lack
the flexibility and natural language understanding capabilities needed for
modern autonomous systems. Existing neuro-symbolic approaches use one-shot
translation from natural language to formal plans, missing the opportunity for
neural and symbolic components to work and refine solutions together. To
address this gap, we develop LOOP -- a novel neuro-symbolic planning framework
that treats planning as an iterative conversation between neural and symbolic
components rather than simple translation. LOOP integrates 13 coordinated
neural features including graph neural networks for spatial relationships,
multi-agent validation for consensus-based correctness, hierarchical
decomposition for complex task management, and causal memory that learns from
both successes and failures. Unlike existing approaches, LOOP generates PDDL
specifications, refines them iteratively based on symbolic feedback, and builds
a causal knowledge base from execution traces. LOOP was evaluated on six
standard IPC benchmark domains, where it achieved 85.8% success rate compared
to LLM+P (55.0%), LLM-as-Planner (19.2%), and Tree-of-Thoughts (3.3%). This
work shows that the key to reliable planning is not in choosing between neural
networks or symbolic reasoners but it lies in making them actually ``talk'' to
each other during the entire process. LOOP provides a thorough blueprint for
building autonomous systems that can finally be trusted with critical
real-world applications.

TL;DR: SPANER是一个模态无关的参数高效微调框架，通过共享提示机制将不同模态输入嵌入到统一语义空间，提升跨模态泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态PEFT方法主要关注任务特定性能提升，但忽视了多模态嵌入空间的结构，导致模态特定表示孤立，限制了跨模态泛化

Method: 提出SPANER框架，使用共享提示机制作为概念锚点，使语义相关的实例在空间中收敛，支持无缝集成新模态而不改变核心架构

Result: 在视觉-语言和音频-视觉基准测试中展示了竞争力的少样本检索性能，同时保持了学习嵌入空间的高语义一致性

Conclusion: 研究表明对齐嵌入结构比仅仅调整适配器权重对于可扩展的多模态学习更为重要

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) have
significantly improved performance on downstream tasks such as few-shot
retrieval. However, most existing approaches focus on task-specific gains while
neglecting the structure of the multimodal embedding space. As a result,
modality-specific representations often remain isolated, limiting cross-modal
generalisation. In this work, we introduce Shared Prompt AligNER (SPANER), a
modality-agnostic PEFT framework designed to embed inputs from diverse
modalities into a unified semantic space. At its core, SPANER employs a shared
prompt mechanism that acts as a conceptual anchor, enabling semantically
related instances to converge spatially regardless of modality. This shared
prompt design is inherently extensible, supporting the seamless integration of
additional modalities, such as audio, without altering the core architecture.
Through comprehensive experiments across vision-language and audio-visual
benchmarks, SPANER demonstrates competitive few-shot retrieval performance
while preserving high semantic coherence in the learned embedding space. Our
results highlight the importance of aligning embedding structures, rather than
merely tuning adapter weights, for scalable multimodal learning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TASER是一个持续学习的智能表格提取系统，专门处理现实世界中多页、碎片化的金融表格，通过模式引导的提取和推荐机制，显著优于现有表格检测模型10.1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实金融文档中的表格信息通常被埋藏在混乱的多页碎片化表格中，99.4%的表格没有边界框，最大行数达426行，跨44页，传统方法难以有效处理。

Method: 开发TASER系统，包含表格检测、分类、提取和推荐代理，利用初始模式执行提取，推荐代理审查输出并建议模式修订，实现持续学习。

Result: TASER比Table Transformer等现有模型性能提升10.1%，大批量处理使可操作模式建议增加104.3%，提取持有量增加9.8%。构建了包含22,584页、3,213个表格、7310亿美元持有量的真实金融数据集。

Conclusion: 基于代理的模式引导提取系统在理解现实世界金融表格方面展现出巨大潜力，发布了TASERTab数据集供研究社区使用。

Abstract: Real-world financial documents report essential information about an entity's
financial holdings that can span millions of different financial instrument
types. Yet, these details are often buried in messy, multi-page, fragmented
tables - for example, 99.4% of the tables in our dataset have no bounding boxes
with the maximum number of rows amounting to 426 per table across 44 pages. To
tackle these unique challenges from real-world tables, we present a
continuously learning, agentic table extraction system, TASER (Table Agents for
Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation) that extracts highly unstructured,
multi-page, heterogeneous tables into normalized, schema-conforming outputs.
Our table agents execute on table detection, classification, extraction, and
recommendations by leveraging an initial schema. Then, our Recommender Agent
reviews the outputs, recommends schema revisions, and decides on the final
recommendations, enabling TASER to outperform existing table detection models
such as Table Transformer by 10.1%. Within this continuous learning process, we
highlight that larger batch sizes result in a 104.3% increase in schema
recommendations that are actionable and utilized, resulting in a 9.8% increase
in extracted holdings - highlighting the importance of a continuous learning
process. To train TASER, we have manually labeled 22,584 pages (28,150,449
tokens), 3,213 tables for $731,685,511,687 of holdings culminating in one of
the first real financial table datasets. We release our dataset TASERTab to
enable the research community to access real-world financial tables and
outputs. Our results highlight the promise of agentic, schema-guided extraction
systems for robust understanding of real-world financial tables.

Conclusion: AI科学发现管道能够进行理论推理和方法严谨的研究，但概念细微差别和理论解释仍有局限，这是迈向能够通过真实实验验证假设的具身AI的重要一步

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems are transforming scientific discovery by
accelerating specific research tasks, from protein structure prediction to
materials design, yet remain confined to narrow domains requiring substantial
human oversight. The exponential growth of scientific literature and increasing
domain specialisation constrain researchers' capacity to synthesise knowledge
across disciplines and develop unifying theories, motivating exploration of
more general-purpose AI systems for science. Here we show that a
domain-agnostic, agentic AI system can independently navigate the scientific
workflow - from hypothesis generation through data collection to manuscript
preparation. The system autonomously designed and executed three psychological
studies on visual working memory, mental rotation, and imagery vividness,
executed one new online data collection with 288 participants, developed
analysis pipelines through 8-hour+ continuous coding sessions, and produced
completed manuscripts. The results demonstrate the capability of AI scientific
discovery pipelines to conduct non-trivial research with theoretical reasoning
and methodological rigour comparable to experienced researchers, though with
limitations in conceptual nuance and theoretical interpretation. This is a step
toward embodied AI that can test hypotheses through real-world experiments,
accelerating discovery by autonomously exploring regions of scientific space
that human cognitive and resource constraints might otherwise leave unexplored.
It raises important questions about the nature of scientific understanding and
the attribution of scientific credit.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal traffic forecasting is challenging due to complex temporal

Transformer-based models offer strong global modeling, they often struggle with
rigid temporal encoding and weak space-time fusion. We propose STPFormer, a
Spatio-Temporal Pattern-Aware Transformer that achieves state-of-the-art

integrates four modules: Temporal Position Aggregator (TPA) for pattern-aware
temporal encoding, Spatial Sequence Aggregator (SSA) for sequential spatial

and an Attention Mixer for multi-scale fusion. Experiments on five real-world

Motivation: 为了求解具有最坏情况性能要求的广泛优化问题，需要一个通用的数学框架和高效解法算法

Method: 定义DMMV数学问题，分析其性质，开发GPU加速的贫估算法，利用DMMV的数学性质加速求解

Result: 在语言模型量化中比现有方法提升15%，离散旋转重建锐减16%错误并加速6倍，FIR滤波器设计洞涩减少50%

Conclusion: DMMV作为通用优化框架具有强大应用潜力，开源的GPU加速算法将促进该领域的进一步研究

Abstract: We introduce the Discrete Min-Max Violation (DMMV) as a general optimization
problem which seeks an assignment of discrete values to variables that
minimizes the largest constraint violation. This context-free mathematical
formulation is applicable to a wide range of use cases that have worst-case
performance requirements. After defining the DMMV problem mathematically, we
explore its properties to establish a foundational understanding. To tackle
DMMV instance sizes of practical relevance, we develop a GPU-accelerated
heuristic that takes advantage of the mathematical properties of DMMV for
speeding up the solution process. We demonstrate the versatile applicability of
our heuristic by solving three optimization problems as use cases: (1)
post-training quantization of language models, (2) discrete tomography, and (3)
Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter design. In quantization without outlier
separation, our heuristic achieves 14% improvement on average over existing
methods. In discrete tomography, it reduces reconstruction error by 16% under
uniform noise and accelerates computations by a factor of 6 on GPU. For FIR
filter design, it nearly achieves 50% ripple reduction compared to using the
commercial integer optimization solver, Gurobi. Our comparative results point
to the benefits of studying DMMV as a context-free optimization problem and the
advantages that our proposed heuristic offers on three distinct problems. Our
GPU-accelerated heuristic will be made open-source to further stimulate
research on DMMV and its other applications. The code is available at

TL;DR: 语言模型代理存在风险识别与安全执行的显著差距，研究发现代理虽然具备风险知识（>98%），但在实际场景中风险识别性能下降23%，并且仍执行风险动作（<26%）。研究提出风险验证器系统，通过抽象化执行轨迹描述，将风险动作执行减少55.3%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型代理在自动化实际任务时存在重大安全风险，但当前研究存在风险意识与安全执行能力之间的显著差距。需要系统性地评估代理在不同层面的安全性能力。

Method: 开发了一个综合评估框架，从三个逐渐进的维度考察代理安全性：1）风险知识水平；2）在执行轨迹中识别风险的能力；3）避免执行风险动作的实际行为。基于观察到的性能差距，提出了风险验证器系统，包含独立批判代理建议动作的验证器，以及将具体执行轨迹转换为抽象描述的抽象器。

Result: 评估结果显示代理存在两个关键性能差距：虽然具备近乎完美的风险知识（>98%通过率），但在实际场景中识别风险的性能下降超23%，并且仍会执行风险动作（<26%通过率）。这种趋势在更强大的语言模型和专门的推理模型（如DeepSeek-R1）中仍持续存在。风险验证器系统将风险动作执行减少55.3%。

Conclusion: 简单扩大模型能力或推理计算并不能本质地解决安全问题。代理在风险识别和安全执行之间存在显著差距，这种差距类似于语言模型中的生成器-验证器差距。研究利用这种差距开发的风险验证器系统能够有效减少风险动作的执行，为提升语言模型代理的安全性提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents have demonstrated significant potential for
automating real-world tasks, yet they pose a diverse array of potential, severe
risks in safety-critical scenarios. In this work, we identify a significant gap
between LM agents' risk awareness and safety execution abilities: while they
often answer "Yes" to queries like "Is executing `sudo rm -rf /*' dangerous?",
they will likely fail to identify such risks in instantiated trajectories or
even directly perform these risky actions when acting as agents. To
systematically investigate this, we develop a comprehensive evaluation
framework to examine agents' safety across three progressive dimensions: 1)
their knowledge about potential risks, 2) their ability to identify
corresponding risks in execution trajectories, and 3) their actual behaviors to
avoid executing these risky actions. Our evaluation reveals two critical
performance gaps that resemble the generator-validator gaps observed in LMs:
while agents demonstrate near-perfect risk knowledge ($>98\%$ pass rates), they
fail to apply this knowledge when identifying risks in actual scenarios (with
performance dropping by $>23\%$) and often still execute risky actions ($<26\%$
pass rates). Notably, this trend persists across more capable LMs as well as in
specialized reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1, indicating that simply scaling
model capabilities or inference compute does not inherently resolve safety
concerns. Instead, we take advantage of these observed gaps to develop a risk
verifier that independently critiques the proposed actions by agents, with an
abstractor that converts specific execution trajectories into abstract
descriptions where LMs can more effectively identify the risks. Our overall
system achieves a significant reduction of risky action execution by $55.3\%$
over vanilla-prompted agents.

and engineering overhead make it unsuitable for rapid prototyping. Crafter
offers a lightweight alternative that retains key challenges from Minecraft,
yet its use has remained limited to narrow tasks due to the absence of
foundation models that have driven progress in the Minecraft setting. In this
paper, we present CrafterDojo, a suite of foundation models and tools that
unlock the Crafter environment as a lightweight, prototyping-friendly, and
Minecraft-like testbed for general-purpose embodied agent research. CrafterDojo
addresses this by introducing CrafterVPT, CrafterCLIP, and CrafterSteve-1 for
behavior priors, vision-language grounding, and instruction following,
respectively. In addition, we provide toolkits for generating behavior and
caption datasets (CrafterPlay and CrafterCaption), reference agent
implementations, benchmark evaluations, and a complete open-source codebase.

TL;DR: EAG-RL是一个两阶段训练框架，通过专家注意力引导增强大语言模型在电子健康记录推理中的内在能力，平均提升14.62%的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法让LLM仅作为检索器，下游深度学习模型处理预测，无法提升LLM的内在推理能力且继承了DL模型的泛化限制

Method: 首先使用专家引导的蒙特卡洛树搜索构建高质量逐步推理轨迹初始化LLM策略，然后通过强化学习将LLM注意力与专家模型识别的临床显著特征对齐

Result: 在两个真实EHR数据集上平均提升14.62%的推理能力，增强了对特征扰动的鲁棒性和对未见临床领域的泛化能力

Conclusion: EAG-RL展示了在临床预测任务中实际部署的潜力

Abstract: Improving large language models (LLMs) for electronic health record (EHR)
reasoning is essential for enabling accurate and generalizable clinical
predictions. While LLMs excel at medical text understanding, they underperform
on EHR-based prediction tasks due to challenges in modeling temporally
structured, high-dimensional data. Existing approaches often rely on hybrid
paradigms, where LLMs serve merely as frozen prior retrievers while downstream
deep learning (DL) models handle prediction, failing to improve the LLM's
intrinsic reasoning capacity and inheriting the generalization limitations of
DL models. To this end, we propose EAG-RL, a novel two-stage training framework
designed to intrinsically enhance LLMs' EHR reasoning ability through expert
attention guidance, where expert EHR models refer to task-specific DL models
trained on EHR data. Concretely, EAG-RL first constructs high-quality, stepwise
reasoning trajectories using expert-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to
effectively initialize the LLM's policy. Then, EAG-RL further optimizes the
policy via reinforcement learning by aligning the LLM's attention with
clinically salient features identified by expert EHR models. Extensive
experiments on two real-world EHR datasets show that EAG-RL improves the
intrinsic EHR reasoning ability of LLMs by an average of 14.62%, while also
enhancing robustness to feature perturbations and generalization to unseen
clinical domains. These results demonstrate the practical potential of EAG-RL
for real-world deployment in clinical prediction tasks. Our code have been

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文针对图表到代码生成任务，提出了多模态结构化强化学习(MSRL)方法，通过多粒度奖励系统突破监督微调的性能瓶颈，在多个基准测试中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然强化学习在视觉语言模型中已证明有效，但在需要深入理解信息丰富图像和生成结构化输出的任务中应用不足。图表到代码生成任务需要复杂的视觉推理，仅靠监督微调往往不够，需要有效的强化学习策略来适当奖励结构化输出。

Method: 提出多模态结构化强化学习(MSRL)，构建包含300万真实arXiv表格图表-代码对的最大训练语料库。采用多粒度结构化奖励系统：文本层面使用基于规则的奖励验证代码细节，视觉层面通过渲染生成代码为图像并使用评估模型评估结构相似性。采用两阶段课程学习确保训练稳定性。

Result: MSRL显著突破了SFT的性能瓶颈，在ChartMimic和ReachQA基准测试中分别将高级指标提升了6.2%和9.9%，达到了与先进闭源模型竞争的性能水平。

Conclusion: 多模态结构化强化学习方法有效解决了图表到代码生成任务中的性能瓶颈问题，通过结合文本和视觉层面的多粒度奖励机制，显著提升了结构化输出的生成质量。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective for general
reasoning in vision-language models, its application to tasks requiring
in-depth understanding of information-rich images and generation of structured
outputs remains underexplored. Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this
challenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate
structured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient,
highlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward
structured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in
SFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured
Reinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially
breaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date,
containing 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate
simplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art
performance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a
plateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method
leverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual
and visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate
fine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess
structural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an
evaluator model. We implement this within a two-stage curriculum for training
stability. Results demonstrate that MSRL significantly breaks the SFT plateau,
improving high-level metrics by 6.2% and 9.9% on ChartMimic and ReachQA
benchmarks respectively, achieving competitive performance with advanced
closed-source models.

TL;DR: V2P方法通过压制注意机制和基于Fitts定律的2D高斯热力图模型，解决GUI元素定位中的背景干扰和中心-边缘区别问题，实现精确的点击定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GUI元素定位方法忽视了空间交互不确定性和视觉-语义层次，存在注意力偏移和点击不精确问题。

Method: 提出Valley-to-Peak(V2P)方法：1)使用压制注意机制减少背景干扰；2)采用Fitts定律启发的2D高斯热力图模型，按元素大小调整权重分布，从中心向边缘逐渐减少。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-v2和ScreenSpot-Pro两个数据集上分别达到92.3%和50.5%的性能。消融实验证明各组成部分的有效性。

Conclusion: V2P方法能够有效分离目标区域并使模型关注UI元素的核心点，具有良好的通用性。

Abstract: Precise localization of GUI elements is crucial for the development of GUI
agents. Traditional methods rely on bounding box or center-point regression,
neglecting spatial interaction uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies.
Recent methods incorporate attention mechanisms but still face two key issues:
(1) ignoring processing background regions causes attention drift from the
desired area, and (2) uniform labeling fails to distinguish between center and
edges of the target UI element, leading to click imprecision. Inspired by how
humans visually process and interact with GUI elements, we propose the
Valley-to-Peak (V2P) method to address these issues. To mitigate background
distractions, V2P introduces a suppression attention mechanism that minimizes
the model's focus on irrelevant regions to highlight the intended region. For
the issue of center-edge distinction, V2P applies a Fitts' Law-inspired
approach by modeling GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps where the weight
gradually decreases from the center towards the edges. The weight distribution
follows a Gaussian function, with the variance determined by the target's size.
Consequently, V2P effectively isolates the target area and teaches the model to
concentrate on the most essential point of the UI element. The model trained by
V2P achieves the performance with 92.3% and 50.5% on two benchmarks
ScreenSpot-v2 and ScreenSpot-Pro. Ablations further confirm each component's
contribution, highlighting V2P's generalizability for precise GUI grounding
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱查询方法主要基于一阶逻辑，无法处理现实查询中常见的模糊或上下文相关的软约束（如属性偏好、相关类别偏好）

Method: 设计神经查询重排序器(NQR)，通过交互式增量学习方式，基于偏好和非偏好实体的示例来调整查询答案评分，不破坏原始查询结果

Result: 扩展了现有QA基准测试，生成包含软约束的数据集，实验表明NQR能有效捕获软约束同时保持稳健的查询性能

Conclusion: NQR成功解决了知识图谱查询中软约束整合的问题，为处理现实世界中模糊偏好查询提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Methods for query answering over incomplete knowledge graphs retrieve
entities that are likely to be answers, which is particularly useful when such
answers cannot be reached by direct graph traversal due to missing edges.
However, existing approaches have focused on queries formalized using
first-order-logic. In practice, many real-world queries involve constraints
that are inherently vague or context-dependent, such as preferences for
attributes or related categories. Addressing this gap, we introduce the problem
of query answering with soft constraints. We propose a Neural Query Reranker
(NQR) designed to adjust query answer scores by incorporating soft constraints
without disrupting the original answers to a query. NQR operates interactively,
refining answers based on incremental examples of preferred and non-preferred
entities. We extend existing QA benchmarks by generating datasets with soft
constraints. Our experiments demonstrate that NQR can capture soft constraints
while maintaining robust query answering performance.

Motivation: LIME方法在训练数据有限时存在随机性问题，导致产生不真实变化和偏离真实数据流形的样本，影响代理模型对原始模型复杂决策边界的准确近似

Method: 通过聚类将源域分为具有代表性原型的集群，捕获与目标实例最相似的相关源域实例，结合目标实例的邻近实例，使用对比学习编码器作为权重机制来分配权重，最终训练代理模型

Result: 提出的ITL-LIME框架能够在数据稀缺环境下提高解释的准确性和稳定性

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了LIME在数据约束情况下的性能问题，为可解释人工智能领域提供了更可靠的解释方法

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, such as Local
Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), have advanced the
interpretability of black-box machine learning models by approximating their
behavior locally using interpretable surrogate models. However, LIME's inherent
randomness in perturbation and sampling can lead to locality and instability
issues, especially in scenarios with limited training data. In such cases, data
scarcity can result in the generation of unrealistic variations and samples
that deviate from the true data manifold. Consequently, the surrogate model may
fail to accurately approximate the complex decision boundary of the original
model. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Instance-based Transfer
Learning LIME framework (ITL-LIME) that enhances explanation fidelity and
stability in data-constrained environments. ITL-LIME introduces instance
transfer learning into the LIME framework by leveraging relevant real instances
from a related source domain to aid the explanation process in the target
domain. Specifically, we employ clustering to partition the source domain into
clusters with representative prototypes. Instead of generating random
perturbations, our method retrieves pertinent real source instances from the
source cluster whose prototype is most similar to the target instance. These
are then combined with the target instance's neighboring real instances. To
define a compact locality, we further construct a contrastive learning-based
encoder as a weighting mechanism to assign weights to the instances from the
combined set based on their proximity to the target instance. Finally, these
weighted source and target instances are used to train the surrogate model for
explanation purposes.

Conclusion: 情境知识图谱具有独特的特征，需要专门设计的链接预测方法，现有通用算法在此领域效果有限。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs are used for various purposes, including business
applications, biomedical analyses, or digital twins in industry 4.0. In this
paper, we investigate knowledge graphs describing household actions, which are
beneficial for controlling household robots and analyzing video footage. In the
latter case, the information extracted from videos is notoriously incomplete,
and completing the knowledge graph for enhancing the situational picture is
essential. In this paper, we show that, while a standard link prediction
problem, situational knowledge graphs have special characteristics that render
many link prediction algorithms not fit for the job, and unable to outperform
even simple baselines.

Motivation: 从第三方网站获取的简历通常不完整且不准确，需要与公司现有人才库进行重复检测来提升简历质量和丰富人才库，但由于简历文本的语义复杂性、结构异质性和信息不完整性，这一任务具有挑战性。

Method: 提出MHSNet框架，使用对比学习微调BGE-M3模型，通过混合专家(MoE)生成多级稀疏和密集简历表示，计算多级语义相似度，并采用状态感知MoE处理各种不完整简历。

Conclusion: MHSNet能够有效解决第三方简历与公司人才库之间的重复检测问题，特别是在处理不完整和异构简历数据方面表现出色。

Abstract: To maintain the company's talent pool, recruiters need to continuously search
for resumes from third-party websites (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed). However,
fetched resumes are often incomplete and inaccurate. To improve the quality of
third-party resumes and enrich the company's talent pool, it is essential to
conduct duplication detection between the fetched resumes and those already in
the company's talent pool. Such duplication detection is challenging due to the
semantic complexity, structural heterogeneity, and information incompleteness
of resume texts. To this end, we propose MHSNet, an multi-level identity
verification framework that fine-tunes BGE-M3 using contrastive learning. With
the fine-tuned , Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) generates multi-level sparse and
dense representations for resumes, enabling the computation of corresponding
multi-level semantic similarities. Moreover, the state-aware Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) is employed in MHSNet to handle diverse incomplete resumes. Experimental
results verify the effectiveness of MHSNet

Abstract: We contribute a theoretical and operational framework for neurosymbolic AI
called DeepLog. DeepLog introduces building blocks and primitives for
neurosymbolic AI that make abstraction of commonly used representations and
computational mechanisms used in neurosymbolic AI. DeepLog can represent and
emulate a wide range of neurosymbolic systems. It consists of two key
components. The first is the DeepLog language for specifying neurosymbolic
models and inference tasks. This language consists of an annotated neural
extension of grounded first-order logic, and makes abstraction of the type of
logic, e.g. boolean, fuzzy or probabilistic, and whether logic is used in the
architecture or in the loss function. The second DeepLog component is situated
at the computational level and uses extended algebraic circuits as
computational graphs. Together these two components are to be considered as a
neurosymbolic abstract machine, with the DeepLog language as the intermediate
level of abstraction and the circuits level as the computational one. DeepLog
is implemented in software, relies on the latest insights in implementing
algebraic circuits on GPUs, and is declarative in that it is easy to obtain
different neurosymbolic models by making different choices for the underlying
algebraic structures and logics. The generality and efficiency of the DeepLog
neurosymbolic machine is demonstrated through an experimental comparison
between 1) different fuzzy and probabilistic logics, 2) between using logic in
the architecture or in the loss function, and 3) between a standalone CPU-based
implementation of a neurosymbolic AI system and a DeepLog GPU-based one.

TL;DR: CausalPlan是一个两阶段框架，通过集成显式结构因果推理来改进LLM代理的规划过程，减少无效动作并提高协作性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM代理（尤其是小型开源模型）在协作任务中因依赖表面相关性而非因果推理而产生无效或不连贯动作的问题

Method: 提出Structural Causal Action (SCA)模型，从代理轨迹中学习因果图，通过因果评分指导动作选择，无需微调LLM本身

Result: 在Overcooked-AI基准测试中，CausalPlan持续减少无效动作并改善AI-AI和人类-AI设置中的协作，优于强化学习基线

Conclusion: 因果驱动规划对于部署高效、可解释和可泛化的多智能体LLM系统具有重要价值

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents-especially smaller, open-source
models-often produce causally invalid or incoherent actions in collaborative
tasks due to their reliance on surface-level correlations rather than grounded
causal reasoning. This limitation undermines their performance in terms of
coordination and planning in dynamic environments. We address this challenge
with CausalPlan, a two-phase framework that integrates explicit structural
causal reasoning into the LLM planning process. At the core of CausalPlan is
the Structural Causal Action (SCA) model, which learns a causal graph from
agent trajectories to capture how prior actions and current environment states
influence future decisions. This structure is then used to guide action
selection by assigning causal scores to LLM-generated proposals, reweighting
them accordingly, or falling back to causally grounded alternatives when
needed. By embedding this causal knowledge directly into the decision loop,
CausalPlan constrains planning to intervention-consistent behaviours without
requiring fine-tuning of the LLM itself. We evaluate CausalPlan on the
Overcooked-AI benchmark across five multi-agent coordination tasks and four
LLMs of varying sizes: Gemma-7B, Llama-8B, Qwen-14B, and Llama-70B.
Experimental results show that CausalPlan consistently reduces invalid actions
and improves collaboration in both AI-AI and human-AI settings, outperforming
strong reinforcement learning baselines. Our findings highlight the value of
causality-driven planning for deploying efficient, interpretable, and
generalisable multi-agent LLM systems.

Method: 两阶段框架：1）专家感知代理招募 - 构建LLM专业表动态选择最优模型；2）置信度和对抗驱动的多代理协作 - 通过置信度融合和对抗验证整合响应

Result: 在三个公开MDM数据集上表现优异，在MMLU-Pro-Health数据集上达到74.45%准确率，比GPT-4-0613提升2.69%

Conclusion: EMRC框架通过专家感知的代理招募策略和代理互补性，有效利用了各LLM的专业能力，显著提升了医疗决策性能

Abstract: Medical Decision-Making (MDM) is a complex process requiring substantial
domain-specific expertise to effectively synthesize heterogeneous and
complicated clinical information. While recent advancements in Large Language
Models (LLMs) show promise in supporting MDM, single-LLM approaches are limited
by their parametric knowledge constraints and static training corpora, failing
to robustly integrate the clinical information. To address this challenge, we
propose the Expertise-aware Multi-LLM Recruitment and Collaboration (EMRC)
framework to enhance the accuracy and reliability of MDM systems. It operates
in two stages: (i) expertise-aware agent recruitment and (ii) confidence- and
adversarial-driven multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, in the first stage,
we use a publicly available corpus to construct an LLM expertise table for
capturing expertise-specific strengths of multiple LLMs across medical
department categories and query difficulty levels. This table enables the
subsequent dynamic selection of the optimal LLMs to act as medical expert
agents for each medical query during the inference phase. In the second stage,
we employ selected agents to generate responses with self-assessed confidence
scores, which are then integrated through the confidence fusion and adversarial
validation to improve diagnostic reliability. We evaluate our EMRC framework on
three public MDM datasets, where the results demonstrate that our EMRC
outperforms state-of-the-art single- and multi-LLM methods, achieving superior
diagnostic performance. For instance, on the MMLU-Pro-Health dataset, our EMRC
achieves 74.45% accuracy, representing a 2.69% improvement over the
best-performing closed-source model GPT- 4-0613, which demonstrates the
effectiveness of our expertise-aware agent recruitment strategy and the agent
complementarity in leveraging each LLM's specialized capabilities.

Abstract: Quantified formulas pose a significant challenge for Satisfiability Modulo
Theories (SMT) solvers due to their inherent undecidability. Existing
instantiation techniques, such as e-matching, syntax-guided, model-based,
conflict-based, and enumerative methods, often complement each other. This
paper introduces a novel instantiation approach that dynamically learns from
these techniques during solving. By treating observed instantiations as samples
from a latent language, we use probabilistic context-free grammars to generate
new, similar terms. Our method not only mimics successful past instantiations
but also explores diversity by optionally inverting learned term probabilities,
aiming to balance exploitation and exploration in quantifier reasoning.

Method: 从理论分析（信息熵角度）和机制分析（流水线层面和模块层面）两方面研究RAG集成框架，选择四种流水线（Branching, Iterative, Loop, Agentic）和三种模块（Generator, Retriever, Reranker）来解决七个研究问题。

Conclusion: 本研究为多RAG系统集成相关研究奠定了基础，证明了集成方法在提升RAG系统性能方面的有效性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology has been widely applied in
recent years. However, despite the emergence of various RAG frameworks, a
single RAG framework still cannot adapt well to a broad range of downstream
tasks. Therefore, how to leverage the advantages of multiple RAG systems has
become an area worth exploring. To address this issue, we have conducted a
comprehensive and systematic investigation into ensemble methods based on RAG
systems. Specifically, we have analyzed the RAG ensemble framework from both
theoretical and mechanistic analysis perspectives. From the theoretical
analysis, we provide the first explanation of the RAG ensemble framework from
the perspective of information entropy. In terms of mechanism analysis, we have
explored the RAG ensemble framework from both the pipeline and module levels.
We carefully select four different pipelines (Branching, Iterative, Loop, and
Agentic) and three different modules (Generator, Retriever, and Reranker) to
solve seven different research questions. The experiments show that aggregating
multiple RAG systems is both generalizable and robust, whether at the pipeline
level or the module level. Our work lays the foundation for similar research on
the multi-RAG system ensemble.

TL;DR: 通过使用伪代码生成、自动调试和反思步骤，改进了基于LLM的广义计划生成方法，在17个域中显著提高了计划质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决之前方法中仅生成一个策略并直接转换为程序，如果策略错误将导致错误的广义计划，需要先期调试和多版本选择机制

Result: 在17个基准领域中，方法显著提高了广义计划质量且从不低于原有方法，在12个域中最佳Python程序能解决所有可生成任务

Conclusion: 通过伪代码先期调试、反思步骤和多版本选择的维护方式，能够有效提高LLM生成广义计划的质量和可靠性

Abstract: LLMs have recently been used to generate Python programs representing
generalized plans in PDDL planning, i.e., plans that generalize across the
tasks of a given PDDL domain. Previous work proposed a framework consisting of
three steps: the LLM first generates a summary and then a strategy for the
domain, both in natural language, and then implements that strategy as a Python
program, that gets debugged on example planning tasks. In that work, only one
strategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation. If the
strategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect
generalized plan. Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in
the form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence
allowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the
generalized plan itself. Additionally, we extend the Python debugging phase
with a reflection step prompting the LLM to pinpoint the reason for the
observed plan failure. Finally, we take inspiration from LLM code generation to
produce several program variants and pick the best one. Running experiments on
17 benchmark domains, we show that these extensions substantially improve (and
never deteriorate) the quality of the generalized plans. In 12 of the domains,
our best Python programs solve all tasks that can be generated with the
respective instance generator.

Abstract: Time-series data is central to decision-making in financial markets, yet
building high-performing, interpretable, and auditable models remains a major
challenge. While Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks streamline
model development, they often lack adaptability and responsiveness to
domain-specific needs and evolving objectives. Concurrently, Large Language
Models (LLMs) have enabled agentic systems capable of reasoning, memory
management, and dynamic code generation, offering a path toward more flexible
workflow automation. In this paper, we introduce \textsf{TS-Agent}, a modular
agentic framework designed to automate and enhance time-series modeling
workflows for financial applications. The agent formalizes the pipeline as a
structured, iterative decision process across three stages: model selection,
code refinement, and fine-tuning, guided by contextual reasoning and
experimental feedback. Central to our architecture is a planner agent equipped
with structured knowledge banks, curated libraries of models and refinement
strategies, which guide exploration, while improving interpretability and
reducing error propagation. \textsf{TS-Agent} supports adaptive learning,
robust debugging, and transparent auditing, key requirements for high-stakes
environments such as financial services. Empirical evaluations on diverse
financial forecasting and synthetic data generation tasks demonstrate that
\textsf{TS-Agent} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AutoML and agentic
baselines, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and decision traceability.

TL;DR: 研究发现AI驱动的协作代理在供应链中会出现"协作悖论"，即理论上更优的协作AI代理比非AI基准表现更差，原因是代理囤积库存导致系统瘫痪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI代理在经济环境中的新兴战略行为，特别是在多级供应链这种容易出现牛鞭效应等不稳定性的合作环境中。

Method: 使用大型语言模型驱动的生成式AI代理在受控供应链模拟中进行计算实验，设计包含高层AI驱动策略制定和低层协作执行协议的综合框架。

Result: 揭示了协作悖论现象，发现只有通过高层策略制定和低层执行协议的综合才能实现系统韧性，最终框架能够自主生成、评估和量化可行的战略选择组合。

Conclusion: 研究为理解协作AI代理的新兴行为提供了关键见解，并为设计稳定有效的AI驱动商业分析系统提供了蓝图。

Abstract: The rise of autonomous, AI-driven agents in economic settings raises critical
questions about their emergent strategic behavior. This paper investigates
these dynamics in the cooperative context of a multi-echelon supply chain, a
system famously prone to instabilities like the bullwhip effect. We conduct
computational experiments with generative AI agents, powered by Large Language
Models (LLMs), within a controlled supply chain simulation designed to isolate
their behavioral tendencies. Our central finding is the "collaboration
paradox": a novel, catastrophic failure mode where theoretically superior
collaborative AI agents, designed with Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI)
principles, perform even worse than non-AI baselines. We demonstrate that this
paradox arises from an operational flaw where agents hoard inventory, starving
the system. We then show that resilience is only achieved through a synthesis
of two distinct layers: high-level, AI-driven proactive policy-setting to
establish robust operational targets, and a low-level, collaborative execution
protocol with proactive downstream replenishment to maintain stability. Our
final framework, which implements this synthesis, can autonomously generate,
evaluate, and quantify a portfolio of viable strategic choices. The work
provides a crucial insight into the emergent behaviors of collaborative AI
agents and offers a blueprint for designing stable, effective AI-driven systems
for business analytics.

TL;DR: 这篇论文探索如何通过精细调整大型语言模型，将其转化为帮助专家使用PyChrono模拟工具的虚拟助手，以生成质量更高的模拟脚本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决专业模拟工具使用门槛高的问题，利用AI技术降低专家使用PyChrono等模拟工具的学习成本，提高模拟效率。

Method: 提出一个精细调整和定制开源及闭源LLM的框架，通过特定过程提升生成PyChrono模拟脚本的质量，包括从简单到复杂的虚拟实验。

Result: 精细调整后的LLM能够生成作为良好起点的模拟脚本，虽然不完美但可以经用户修改改进；同时能回答特定API问题和推荐建模方法。

Conclusion: 该框架具有普遍性，可应用于降低其他模拟工具的使用门槛，为不同应用领域的专家提供AI助手支持。

Abstract: This contribution is concerned with the following issue: can pretrained large
language models (LLMs) be refined and customized to the point where they become
virtual assistants helping experts with the effective use of a simulation tool?
In this case study, the ``simulation tool'' considered is PyChrono, an open
source multi-physics dynamics engine for multibody systems. We present a
framework for refining and customizing both open- and closed-source LLMs to
harness the power of AI in generating scripts that perform PyChrono virtual
experiments. We refine and customize several classes of LLMs through a process
that leads to a quantifiable improvement in the quality of the generated
PyChrono simulation scripts. These scripts can range from simple
single-pendulum simulations to complex virtual experiments involving full
vehicles on deformable terrain. While the generated scripts are rarely perfect,
they often serve as strong starting points for the user to modify and improve
on. Additionally, the LLM can answer specific API questions about the
simulator, or recommend modeling approaches. The framework discussed is general
and can be applied to lower the entry barrier for simulation tools associated
with other application domains.

*Christian Blum,Pedro Pinacho-Davidson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 使用偏置随机密钥遗传算法(BRKGA)解决最长运行子序列(LRS)这个NP难问题，运行结果显示该方法目前是最先进技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRS问题是来自生物信息学的NP难组合优化问题，在基因组重新组装中发挥重要作用。需要开发高效算法来解决这个具有实际应用价值的问题。

Method: 提出使用BRKGA算法，重点关注个体评估的计算效率，将灰度值向量转换为有效解。为了对比，还开发了最大-最小蚂蚁系统和使用CPLEX整数线性规划求解器。

Result: 计算结果显示，提出的BRKGA方法在LRS问题上表现出目前最先进的性能，是一种state-of-the-art技术。

Conclusion: BRKGA在LRS问题上表现优异，但在大字母表大小的输入字符串上仍有改进空间，需要进一步优化。

Abstract: The longest run subsequence (LRS) problem is an NP-hard combinatorial
optimization problem belonging to the class of subsequence problems from
bioinformatics. In particular, the problem plays a role in genome reassembly.
In this paper, we present a solution to the LRS problem using a Biased Random
Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA). Our approach places particular focus on the
computational efficiency of evaluating individuals, which involves converting
vectors of gray values into valid solutions to the problem. For comparison
purposes, a Max-Min Ant System is developed and implemented. This is in
addition to the application of the integer linear programming solver CPLEX for
solving all considered problem instances. The computation results show that the
proposed BRKGA is currently a state-of-the-art technique for the LRS problem.
Nevertheless, the results also show that there is room for improvement,
especially in the context of input strings based on large alphabet sizes.

Abstract: We introduce ComputerRL, a framework for autonomous desktop intelligence that
enables agents to operate complex digital workspaces skillfully. ComputerRL
features the API-GUI paradigm, which unifies programmatic API calls and direct
GUI interaction to address the inherent mismatch between machine agents and
human-centric desktop environments. Scaling end-to-end RL training is crucial
for improvement and generalization across diverse desktop tasks, yet remains
challenging due to environmental inefficiency and instability in extended
training. To support scalable and robust training, we develop a distributed RL
infrastructure capable of orchestrating thousands of parallel virtual desktop
environments to accelerate large-scale online RL. Furthermore, we propose
Entropulse, a training strategy that alternates reinforcement learning with
supervised fine-tuning, effectively mitigating entropy collapse during extended
training runs. We employ ComputerRL on open models GLM-4-9B-0414 and
Qwen2.5-14B, and evaluate them on the OSWorld benchmark. The AutoGLM-OS-9B
based on GLM-4-9B-0414 achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 48.1%,
demonstrating significant improvements for general agents in desktop
automation. The algorithm and framework are adopted in building AutoGLM (Liu et
al., 2024a)
