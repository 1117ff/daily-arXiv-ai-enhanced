Abstract: As the computer vision community advances autonomous driving algorithms,
integrating vision-based insights with sensor data remains essential for
improving perception, decision making, planning, prediction, simulation, and
control. Yet we must ask: Why don't we have entirely safe self-driving cars
yet? A key part of the answer lies in addressing novel scenarios, one of the
most critical barriers to real-world deployment. Our 2COOOL workshop provides a
dedicated forum for researchers and industry experts to push the state of the
art in novelty handling, including out-of-distribution hazard detection,
vision-language models for hazard understanding, new benchmarking and
methodologies, and safe autonomous driving practices. The 2nd Workshop on the
Challenge of Out-of-Label Hazards in Autonomous Driving (2COOOL) will be held
at the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025 in Honolulu,
Hawaii, on October 19, 2025. We aim to inspire the development of new
algorithms and systems for hazard avoidance, drawing on ideas from anomaly
detection, open-set recognition, open-vocabulary modeling, domain adaptation,
and related fields. Building on the success of its inaugural edition at the
Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2025, the workshop
will feature a mix of academic and industry participation.

### [2] [Advanced Deep Learning Techniques for Classifying Dental Conditions Using Panoramic X-Ray Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21088)
*Alireza Golkarieh,Kiana Kiashemshaki,Sajjad Rezvani Boroujeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了三种深度学习方法来分类全景X射线图像中的牙齿状况，发现CNN与随机森林的混合模型表现最佳，准确率达85.4%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发自动化牙齿状况分类系统，为牙科诊断提供可靠支持，提高诊断效率和准确性

Method: 使用1,512张全景X射线图像数据集，采用三种方法：自定义CNN、CNN特征提取与传统分类器混合模型、预训练架构微调，使用5折交叉验证评估

Result: 混合CNN随机森林模型准确率最高（85.4%），优于自定义CNN基线（74.3%）；预训练模型中VGG16表现最好（82.3%）

Conclusion: CNN特征提取与集成分类器结合是自动化牙科诊断支持的实用路径，但需要更大数据集和进一步临床验证

Abstract: This study investigates deep learning methods for automated classification of
dental conditions in panoramic X-ray images. A dataset of 1,512 radiographs
with 11,137 expert-verified annotations across four conditions fillings,
cavities, implants, and impacted teeth was used. After preprocessing and class
balancing, three approaches were evaluated: a custom convolutional neural
network (CNN), hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional
classifiers, and fine-tuned pre-trained architectures. Experiments employed 5
fold cross validation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as
evaluation metrics. The hybrid CNN Random Forest model achieved the highest
performance with 85.4% accuracy, surpassing the custom CNN baseline of 74.3%.
Among pre-trained models, VGG16 performed best at 82.3% accuracy, followed by
Xception and ResNet50. Results show that hybrid models improve discrimination
of morphologically similar conditions and provide efficient, reliable
performance. These findings suggest that combining CNN-based feature extraction
with ensemble classifiers offers a practical path toward automated dental
diagnostic support, while also highlighting the need for larger datasets and
further clinical validation.

### [3] [Q-Align: Alleviating Attention Leakage in Zero-Shot Appearance Transfer via Query-Query Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21090)
*Namu Kim,Wonbin Kweon,Minsoo Kim,Hwanjo Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Align通过Query-Query对齐解决大模型零样本外观迁移中的注意力泄漏问题，在保持结构的同时显著提升外观保真度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模图像生成模型在零样本外观迁移中存在注意力泄漏问题，这是由于Query-Key对齐导致的语义映射不准确

Method: 提出Q-Align方法，包含三个核心贡献：1) Query-Query对齐实现精细空间语义映射；2) Key-Value重排增强特征对应；3) 使用重排后的键值进行注意力精化保持语义一致性

Result: 通过大量实验验证，Q-Align在外观保真度方面优于最先进方法，同时保持竞争力的结构保持能力

Conclusion: Q-Align有效解决了注意力泄漏问题，为零样本外观迁移提供了更准确的语义对齐方案

Abstract: We observe that zero-shot appearance transfer with large-scale image
generation models faces a significant challenge: Attention Leakage. This
challenge arises when the semantic mapping between two images is captured by
the Query-Key alignment. To tackle this issue, we introduce Q-Align, utilizing
Query-Query alignment to mitigate attention leakage and improve the semantic
alignment in zero-shot appearance transfer. Q-Align incorporates three core
contributions: (1) Query-Query alignment, facilitating the sophisticated
spatial semantic mapping between two images; (2) Key-Value rearrangement,
enhancing feature correspondence through realignment; and (3) Attention
refinement using rearranged keys and values to maintain semantic consistency.
We validate the effectiveness of Q-Align through extensive experiments and
analysis, and Q-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance
fidelity while maintaining competitive structure preservation.

### [4] [ERTACache: Error Rectification and Timesteps Adjustment for Efficient Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21091)
*Xurui Peng,Hong Liu,Chenqian Yan,Rui Ma,Fangmin Chen,Xing Wang,Zhihua Wu,Songwei Liu,Mingbao Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERTACache是一个针对扩散模型的加速框架，通过智能缓存和误差校正实现2倍推理加速，同时保持甚至提升生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型由于迭代推理过程导致计算开销巨大，传统缓存方法会造成明显的质量下降，需要解决缓存引起的累积误差问题

Method: 提出ERTACache框架，包含离线残差分析识别可重用步骤、轨迹感知校正系数动态调整积分区间、闭式残差线性化模型近似缓存误差

Result: 在标准图像和视频生成基准测试中实现2倍推理加速，视觉质量保持一致或提升，在Wan2.1视频扩散模型上保持基准保真度

Conclusion: ERTACache通过系统分析缓存误差并联合校正，为扩散模型提供了高效且准确的加速解决方案，显著提升推理效率

Abstract: Diffusion models suffer from substantial computational overhead due to their
inherently iterative inference process. While feature caching offers a
promising acceleration strategy by reusing intermediate outputs across
timesteps, naive reuse often incurs noticeable quality degradation. In this
work, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and
decompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by
inaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from
error propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we
propose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both
error types. Our method employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify
reusable steps, dynamically adjusts integration intervals via a
trajectory-aware correction coefficient, and analytically approximates
cache-induced errors through a closed-form residual linearization model.
Together, these components enable accurate and efficient sampling under
aggressive cache reuse. Extensive experiments across standard image and video
generation benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup
while consistently preserving or even improving visual quality. Notably, on the
state-of-the-art Wan2.1 video diffusion model, ERTACache delivers 2x
acceleration with minimal VBench degradation, effectively maintaining baseline
fidelity while significantly improving efficiency. The code is available at
https://github.com/bytedance/ERTACache.

### [5] [Video-LLMs with Temporal Visual Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21094)
*Zheyu Fan,Jiateng Liu,Yuji Zhang,Zihan Wang,Yi R.,Fung,Manling Li,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该文章提出了时间视觉筛选(TVS)方法，通过保留关键视频段落和重构查询，有效提升视频大语言模型的时间语义理解能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型因为帧采样稀疏和帧间推理监督不充分，无法抓取细粒度的时间语义，需要模仿人类的时间筛选机制

Method: 提出TVS方法：(1)保留重点关键视频段落，(2)同步重构查询为更直接形式保持答案一致性，(3)保持答案的不变性和一致性，并构建了首个TVS基准数据集

Result: 实验结果显示，采用TVS方法在训练阶段获得相对提升7.33%，在推理阶段获得相对提升34.6%，在视频剪辑任务上F-1分数超过之前方法0.47

Conclusion: TVS方法通过优化推理负荷分布和认知负荷，有效提升了视频-语言理解的性能，证明了时间信息筛选对于改善视频语言理解的重要性

Abstract: Humans naturally perform temporal screening by dragging the progress bar and
focusing on salient temporal segments, but current Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained temporal semantics due to sparse
frame sampling and insufficient inter-frame reasoning supervision during their
training. To address this, Inspired by well-established cognitive science
principles, we propose Temporal Visual Screening (TVS), a new task that
universally pre-processes video question answering and instruction tuning data
by: (1) retaining focus-critical video segments, (2) synchronously
reconstructing queries to their most direct form while preserving answer
consistency, and (3) keeping the invariance and consistency for any possible
answer. TVS is formulated as a modular front-end adapter task that can be
seamlessly integrated into both Video Instruction Tuning (training) and Video
Question Answering (inference) pipelines. TVS optimizes distribution of
reasoning burden and cognitive load; during training, it aligns queries with
focus-critical visual information; at inference, it enables query-aware segment
focus and streamlined query representations. In particular, we curate the first
benchmark for TVS and propose ReSimplifyIt, a baseline outperforming prior
approaches on seemingly similar tasks by 0.47 in F-1 score on video trimming
while achieving competitive query rewriting performance. Experiments
demonstrate that incorporating TVS yields relative gains of 7.33% (training)
and 34.6% (inference), demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal information
screening for improving video-language understanding.

### [6] [ROBUST-MIPS: A Combined Skeletal Pose and Instance Segmentation Dataset for Laparoscopic Surgical Instruments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21096)
*Zhe Han,Charlie Budd,Gongyu Zhang,Huanyu Tian,Christos Bergeles,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用骨骼姿态标注作为外科手术工具定位的更高效标注方法，并发布了ROBUST-MIPS数据集来促进这种标注方式的采用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于深度学习的手术工具分割方法受限于标注数据的多样性，而骨骼姿态标注在语义信息丰富性和标注便捷性之间取得了更好的平衡，可以加速标注数据的增长。

Method: 从现有的ROBUST-MIS数据集衍生出ROBUST-MIPS数据集，包含工具姿态和实例分割标注；使用流行的姿态估计方法建立简单基准测试。

Result: 观察到使用姿态标注进行手术工具定位可以获得高质量的结果。

Conclusion: 骨骼姿态标注是外科手术工具定位的有效方法，通过发布数据集、基准模型和标注软件来促进该方法的采用。

Abstract: Localisation of surgical tools constitutes a foundational building block for
computer-assisted interventional technologies. Works in this field typically
focus on training deep learning models to perform segmentation tasks.
Performance of learning-based approaches is limited by the availability of
diverse annotated data. We argue that skeletal pose annotations are a more
efficient annotation approach for surgical tools, striking a balance between
richness of semantic information and ease of annotation, thus allowing for
accelerated growth of available annotated data. To encourage adoption of this
annotation style, we present, ROBUST-MIPS, a combined tool pose and tool
instance segmentation dataset derived from the existing ROBUST-MIS dataset. Our
enriched dataset facilitates the joint study of these two annotation styles and
allow head-to-head comparison on various downstream tasks. To demonstrate the
adequacy of pose annotations for surgical tool localisation, we set up a simple
benchmark using popular pose estimation methods and observe high-quality
results. To ease adoption, together with the dataset, we release our benchmark
models and custom tool pose annotation software.

### [7] [Safe-Control: A Safety Patch for Mitigating Unsafe Content in Text-to-Image Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21099)
*Xiangtao Meng,Yingkai Dong,Ning Yu,Li Wang,Zheng Li,Shanqing Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Safe-Control是一个即插即用的安全补丁，通过数据驱动策略和安全感知条件，在文本到图像生成模型中注入安全控制信号，有效减少不安全内容生成，同时保持良性图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成模型安全机制容易受到分布偏移的规避攻击，或者需要大量模型特定调整，需要一种更灵活有效的安全解决方案。

Method: 使用数据驱动策略和安全感知条件，以补丁形式向锁定的T2I模型注入安全控制信号，支持构建多种安全补丁并可灵活合并。

Result: 在六个不同的T2I模型上评估显示，Safe-Control将不安全内容生成概率降至7%，显著优于其他七种最先进的安全机制（约20%），同时保持良性图像质量和文本对齐。

Conclusion: Safe-Control作为一种即插即用的安全补丁，能有效减少T2I模型的不安全内容生成，具有很好的适应性和兼容性，优于现有安全机制。

Abstract: Despite the advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their
potential for misuse or even abuse raises serious safety concerns. Model
developers have made tremendous efforts to introduce safety mechanisms that can
address these concerns in T2I models. However, the existing safety mechanisms,
whether external or internal, either remain susceptible to evasion under
distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments. To address
these limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play
safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models.
Using data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects
safety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a
patch-like manner. Model developers can also construct various safety patches
to meet the evolving safety requirements, which can be flexibly merged into a
single, unified patch. Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability,
making it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoising architecture.
We conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models.
Empirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe
content generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generative
architectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of
benign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including
both external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all
baselines in reducing unsafe content generation. For example, it reduces the
probability of unsafe content generation to 7%, compared to approximately 20%
for most baseline methods, under both unsafe prompts and the latest adversarial
attacks.

*Kei Katsumata,Yui Iioka,Naoki Hosomi,Teruhisa Misu,Kentaro Yamada,Komei Sugiura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GENNAV是一个用于从自然语言指令和前置摄像头图像中识别目标区域位置的新方法，特别擅长处理边界模糊的stuff-type目标区域，并在多目标和无目标情况下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理stuff-type目标区域（边界模糊）以及无目标或多目标情况时表现不佳，需要一种能够同时预测目标存在性和生成分割掩码的解决方案。

Method: 提出GENNAV方法，能够预测目标存在性并为多个stuff-type目标区域生成分割掩码。构建了GRiN-Drive基准数据集，包含无目标、单目标和多目标三种样本类型。

Result: GENNAV在标准评估指标上优于基线方法。在四个汽车、五个不同地理区域的城市环境中进行的真实世界实验验证了其零样本迁移性能，表现出强大的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GENNAV方法在处理复杂的目标区域识别任务中表现出色，特别是在stuff-type目标、多目标和无目标场景下具有显著优势，展现了在实际自动驾驶环境中的实用价值。

Abstract: We focus on the task of identifying the location of target regions from a
natural language instruction and a front camera image captured by a mobility.
This task is challenging because it requires both existence prediction and
segmentation, particularly for stuff-type target regions with ambiguous
boundaries. Existing methods often underperform in handling stuff-type target
regions, in addition to absent or multiple targets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GENNAV, which predicts target existence and generates
segmentation masks for multiple stuff-type target regions. To evaluate GENNAV,
we constructed a novel benchmark called GRiN-Drive, which includes three
distinct types of samples: no-target, single-target, and multi-target. GENNAV
achieved superior performance over baseline methods on standard evaluation
metrics. Furthermore, we conducted real-world experiments with four automobiles
operated in five geographically distinct urban areas to validate its zero-shot
transfer performance. In these experiments, GENNAV outperformed baseline
methods and demonstrated its robustness across diverse real-world environments.

### [9] [R-4B: Incentivizing General-Purpose Auto-Thinking Capability in MLLMs via Bi-Mode Annealing and Reinforce Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21113)
*Jie Jiang,Qi Yang,Bolin Ni,Shiming Xiang,Han Hu,Houwen Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R-4B是一个自适应思考的多模态大语言模型，能够根据问题复杂度自动决定是否启用思考过程，在保持高性能的同时降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在处理简单问题时也会进行冗余的逐步思考过程，导致计算效率低下。需要一种能够自适应决定是否思考的模型来提高效率。

Method: 采用双模式退火训练方法，让模型同时具备思考和非思考能力，并通过双模式策略优化(BPO)来提升模型判断是否激活思考过程的准确性。训练分为两个阶段：首先在精心策划的数据集上训练，然后在改进的GRPO框架下进行策略优化。

Result: R-4B在25个具有挑战性的基准测试中达到了最先进的性能，在大多数任务中超越了Qwen2.5-VL-7B，在推理密集型基准测试中与更大的16B模型性能相当，但计算成本更低。

Conclusion: R-4B通过自适应思考机制成功解决了多模态大语言模型在处理简单问题时的计算效率问题，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了计算开销。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking
capabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning
problems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems
solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose
R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on
problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both
thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply
Bi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in
determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first
train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which
contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a
second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy
model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query.
Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance
across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks
and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as
Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower
computational cost.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiddenObject是一个基于Mamba的RGB、热成像和深度数据融合框架，用于在遮挡、伪装等恶劣条件下检测隐藏或部分遮蔽物体，在多个基准数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB检测方法在遮挡、伪装和光照变化等恶劣条件下性能受限，需要更鲁棒的模态无关方法来检测隐藏或部分遮蔽物体。

Method: 提出HiddenObject融合框架，使用Mamba-based融合机制整合RGB、热成像和深度数据，捕获跨模态的互补信号，识别模态特定特征并在统一表示中进行融合。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上验证，相比现有方法达到最先进或具有竞争力的性能，证明了融合设计的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于Mamba的融合架构能够显著推进多模态物体检测领域发展，特别是在视觉退化或复杂条件下，同时暴露了当前单模态和简单融合策略的关键局限性。

Abstract: Detecting hidden or partially concealed objects remains a fundamental
challenge in multimodal environments, where factors like occlusion, camouflage,
and lighting variations significantly hinder performance. Traditional RGB-based
detection methods often fail under such adverse conditions, motivating the need
for more robust, modality-agnostic approaches. In this work, we present
HiddenObject, a fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data
using a Mamba-based fusion mechanism. Our method captures complementary signals
across modalities, enabling enhanced detection of obscured or camouflaged
targets. Specifically, the proposed approach identifies modality-specific
features and fuses them in a unified representation that generalizes well
across challenging scenarios. We validate HiddenObject across multiple
benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive performance
compared to existing methods. These results highlight the efficacy of our
fusion design and expose key limitations in current unimodal and na\"ive fusion
strategies. More broadly, our findings suggest that Mamba-based fusion
architectures can significantly advance the field of multimodal object
detection, especially under visually degraded or complex conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统"渲染比较"方法存在空间信息丢失和域差距问题，而现有双平面X射线3D重建方法受限于密集视图要求和噪声X射线处理困难。

Method: 提出RadGS-Reg框架，包含基于学习的辐射高斯重建模块和反事实注意力学习机制，专注于噪声X射线中的椎体区域，并采用患者特异性预训练策略从模拟数据逐步适应到真实数据。

Result: 在内部数据集上的实验显示，该方法在两个任务上都达到了最先进的性能，超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: RadGS-Reg通过创新的联合重建和配准方法，有效解决了CT/X射线配准中的关键挑战，为图像引导导航提供了高精度和实时性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT)/X-ray registration in image-guided navigation
remains challenging because of its stringent requirements for high accuracy and
real-time performance. Traditional "render and compare" methods, relying on
iterative projection and comparison, suffer from spatial information loss and
domain gap. 3D reconstruction from biplanar X-rays supplements spatial and
shape information for 2D/3D registration, but current methods are limited by
dense-view requirements and struggles with noisy X-rays. To address these
limitations, we introduce RadGS-Reg, a novel framework for vertebral-level
CT/X-ray registration through joint 3D Radiative Gaussians (RadGS)
reconstruction and 3D/3D registration. Specifically, our biplanar X-rays
vertebral RadGS reconstruction module explores learning-based RadGS
reconstruction method with a Counterfactual Attention Learning (CAL) mechanism,
focusing on vertebral regions in noisy X-rays. Additionally, a patient-specific
pre-training strategy progressively adapts the RadGS-Reg from simulated to real
data while simultaneously learning vertebral shape prior knowledge. Experiments
on in-house datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance for both
tasks, surpassing existing methods. The code is available at:

Motivation: 由于缺乏大规模标注的3D建筑数据集，自动生成准确且语义丰富的3D建筑模型面临重大挑战。受计算机视觉中合成数据成功的启发，需要构建大规模合成数据集来推动3D建筑生成算法的发展。

Method: 创建包含620万个合成3D住宅建筑的数据集，每个建筑通过三种模态表示：LoD 4语义丰富3D线框图、对应的平面图像和LiDAR式屋顶点云。语义标注从平面图像中提取，包含房间、门窗信息。

Conclusion: SYNBUILD-3D为开发能够自动化生成语义几何一致的LoD 4级别3D建筑模型的生成算法提供了重要基础，数据集和代码样本已公开可用。

Abstract: 3D building models are critical for applications in architecture, energy
simulation, and navigation. Yet, generating accurate and semantically rich 3D
buildings automatically remains a major challenge due to the lack of
large-scale annotated datasets in the public domain. Inspired by the success of
synthetic data in computer vision, we introduce SYNBUILD-3D, a large, diverse,
and multi-modal dataset of over 6.2 million synthetic 3D residential buildings
at Level of Detail (LoD) 4. In the dataset, each building is represented
through three distinct modalities: a semantically enriched 3D wireframe graph
at LoD 4 (Modality I), the corresponding floor plan images (Modality II), and a
LiDAR-like roof point cloud (Modality III). The semantic annotations for each
building wireframe are derived from the corresponding floor plan images and
include information on rooms, doors, and windows. Through its tri-modal nature,
future work can use SYNBUILD-3D to develop novel generative AI algorithms that
automate the creation of 3D building models at LoD 4, subject to predefined
floor plan layouts and roof geometries, while enforcing semantic-geometric
consistency. Dataset and code samples are publicly available at

Motivation: 在真实图像处理中，相机镜头引起的几何畸变（特别是径向畸变）会影响单应性估计的准确性。现有的方法分别处理不同的畸变配置，缺乏统一的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的统一方法，能够同时处理三种径向畸变配置：单图像畸变、相同畸变和独立畸变。基于此方法构建了最小求解器，实现了快速稳定的计算。

Result: 在包括鱼眼相机图像在内的标准基准测试中，所提出的求解器在保持相似精度的同时，比现有最先进求解器速度更快。

Conclusion: 该方法为径向畸变单应性估计提供了一个统一的框架，所开发的求解器在速度和准确性方面都表现出色，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Homographies are among the most prevalent transformations occurring in
geometric computer vision and projective geometry, and homography estimation is
consequently a crucial step in a wide assortment of computer vision tasks. When
working with real images, which are often afflicted with geometric distortions
caused by the camera lens, it may be necessary to determine both the homography
and the lens distortion-particularly the radial component, called radial
distortion-simultaneously to obtain anything resembling useful estimates. When
considering a homography with radial distortion between two images, there are
three conceptually distinct configurations for the radial distortion; (i)
distortion in only one image, (ii) identical distortion in the two images, and
(iii) independent distortion in the two images. While these cases have been
addressed separately in the past, the present paper provides a novel and
unified approach to solve all three cases. We demonstrate how the proposed
approach can be used to construct new fast, stable, and accurate minimal
solvers for radially distorted homographies. In all three cases, our proposed
solvers are faster than the existing state-of-the-art solvers while maintaining
similar accuracy. The solvers are tested on well-established benchmarks
including images taken with fisheye cameras. The source code for our solvers

### [14] [GCAV: A Global Concept Activation Vector Framework for Cross-Layer Consistency in Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21197)
*Zhenghao He,Sanchit Sinha,Guangzhi Xiong,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了全局概念激活向量(GCAV)框架，通过对比学习和注意力融合机制统一不同层的CAV表示，解决跨层概念不一致问题，提高概念归因的稳定性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概念激活向量(CAVs)在不同层独立计算时存在不一致性，导致跨层比较不可靠，需要一种统一的方法来保持概念表示的语义一致性。

Method: 使用对比学习对齐跨层概念表示，采用基于注意力的融合机制构建全局集成的CAV，并提出了TGCAV方法来评估GCAV表示的效果。

Result: 实验表明GCAV显著降低了TCAV分数的方差，保持了概念相关性，有效缓解了跨层概念不一致问题，增强了概念定位能力并提高了对抗扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GCAV通过整合跨层信息提供了一个更全面、可解释的框架，帮助理解深度学习模型如何编码人类定义的概念。

Abstract: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) provide a powerful approach for
interpreting deep neural networks by quantifying their sensitivity to
human-defined concepts. However, when computed independently at different
layers, CAVs often exhibit inconsistencies, making cross-layer comparisons
unreliable. To address this issue, we propose the Global Concept Activation
Vector (GCAV), a novel framework that unifies CAVs into a single, semantically
consistent representation. Our method leverages contrastive learning to align
concept representations across layers and employs an attention-based fusion
mechanism to construct a globally integrated CAV. By doing so, our method
significantly reduces the variance in TCAV scores while preserving concept
relevance, ensuring more stable and reliable concept attributions. To evaluate
the effectiveness of GCAV, we introduce Testing with Global Concept Activation
Vectors (TGCAV) as a method to apply TCAV to GCAV-based representations. We
conduct extensive experiments on multiple deep neural networks, demonstrating
that our method effectively mitigates concept inconsistency across layers,
enhances concept localization, and improves robustness against adversarial
perturbations. By integrating cross-layer information into a coherent
framework, our method offers a more comprehensive and interpretable
understanding of how deep learning models encode human-defined concepts. Code

### [15] [Generalizable Object Re-Identification via Visual In-Context Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21222)
*Zhizhong Huang,Xiaoming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VICP是一个无需参数调整的视觉上下文提示框架，通过结合LLM和视觉基础模型，实现从已见类别到未见类别的零样本对象重识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对象重识别方法需要为每个新类别训练特定模型，缺乏泛化能力且标注成本高。自监督学习难以捕捉身份敏感特征。

Method: 使用LLM从少量正负样本对中推断语义身份规则，通过任务特定提示指导视觉基础模型（如DINO）提取身份判别特征，利用动态视觉提示对齐语义概念与预训练先验。

Result: 在ShopID10K数据集和多个ReID基准测试中，VICP在未见类别上明显优于基线方法。

Conclusion: VICP框架通过视觉上下文提示实现了跨类别的零样本对象重识别，消除了数据集特定重新训练的需求，展现了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Current object re-identification (ReID) methods train domain-specific models
(e.g., for persons or vehicles), which lack generalization and demand costly
labeled data for new categories. While self-supervised learning reduces
annotation needs by learning instance-wise invariance, it struggles to capture
\textit{identity-sensitive} features critical for ReID. This paper proposes
Visual In-Context Prompting~(VICP), a novel framework where models trained on
seen categories can directly generalize to unseen novel categories using only
\textit{in-context examples} as prompts, without requiring parameter
adaptation. VICP synergizes LLMs and vision foundation models~(VFM): LLMs infer
semantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through
task-specific prompting, which then guides a VFM (\eg, DINO) to extract
ID-discriminative features via \textit{dynamic visual prompts}. By aligning
LLM-derived semantic concepts with the VFM's pre-trained prior, VICP enables
generalization to novel categories, eliminating the need for dataset-specific
retraining. To support evaluation, we introduce ShopID10K, a dataset of 10K
object instances from e-commerce platforms, featuring multi-view images and
cross-domain testing. Experiments on ShopID10K and diverse ReID benchmarks
demonstrate that VICP outperforms baselines by a clear margin on unseen
categories. Code is available at https://github.com/Hzzone/VICP.

*Keshav Jha,William Sharp,Dominic LaBella*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究使用SegResNet模型在PANTHER挑战赛的两个MRI胰腺肿瘤分割任务上进行评估，结果显示T1加权MRI任务DSC为0.56，T2加权MRI任务性能下降至DSC 0.33，表明小数据集下MRI序列差异对分割性能有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺肿瘤的精确分割对诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但由于解剖变异性和数据集有限，自动分割仍然具有挑战性。本研究旨在评估SegResNet模型在不同MRI序列下的胰腺肿瘤分割性能。

Method: 采用Auto3DSeg架构中的SegResNet模型，在PANTHER挑战赛的两个任务上进行5折交叉验证和STAPLE集成，重点关注解剖相关感兴趣区域。任务1使用91例T1加权动脉对比增强MRI，任务2使用50例T2加权MR-Linac病例。

Result: 任务1（T1加权MRI）获得DSC 0.56、5 mm DSC 0.73、HD95 41.1 mm、MASD 26.0 mm、RMSE 5164 mm；任务2（T2加权MRI）性能下降，DSC 0.33、5 mm DSC 0.50、HD95 20.1 mm、MASD 7.2 mm、RMSE 17203 mm。

Conclusion: 研究结果显示了小数据集下MRI胰腺肿瘤分割的挑战性，不同MRI序列会引入显著变异性。尽管性能一般，但证明了自动分割的潜力，强调需要更大、标准化的MRI数据集来提高模型鲁棒性和临床实用性。

Abstract: Accurate delineation of pancreatic tumors is critical for diagnosis,
treatment planning, and outcome assessment, yet automated segmentation remains
challenging due to anatomical variability and limited dataset availability. In
this study, SegResNet models, as part of the Auto3DSeg architecture, were
trained and evaluated on two MRI-based pancreatic tumor segmentation tasks as
part of the 2025 PANTHER Challenge. Algorithm methodology included 5-fold
cross-validation with STAPLE ensembling after focusing on an anatomically
relevant region-of-interest. The Pancreatic Tumor Segmentation on Diagnostic
MRI task 1 training set included 91 T1-weighted arterial contrast-enhanced MRI
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. The Pancreatic Tumor
Segmentation on MR-Linac task 2 training set used 50 T2-weighted MR-Linac cases
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. Algorithm-automated
segmentation performance of pancreatic tumor was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), 5 mm DSC, 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95), Mean
Average Surface Distance (MASD), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For Task 1,
the algorithm achieved a DSC of 0.56, 5 mm DSC of 0.73, HD95 of 41.1 mm, MASD
of 26.0 mm, and RMSE of 5164 mm. For Task 2, performance decreased, with a DSC
of 0.33, 5 mm DSC of 0.50, HD95 of 20.1 mm, MASD of 7.2 mm, and RMSE of 17,203
mm. These findings illustrate the challenges of MRI-based pancreatic tumor
segmentation with small datasets, highlighting variability introduced by
different MRI sequences. Despite modest performance, the results demonstrate
potential for automated delineation and emphasize the need for larger,
standardized MRI datasets to improve model robustness and clinical utility.

*Yidong Zhao,Peter Kellman,Hui Xue,Tongyun Yang,Yi Zhang,Yuchi Han,Orlando Simonetti,Qian Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reverse Imaging是一种基于物理原理的心脏MRI数据增强方法，通过逆向推断底层自旋属性来解决不同成像序列间的泛化问题，显著提升分割模型的跨域性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心脏MRI预训练分割模型在不同成像序列间泛化能力差，主要由于成像协议变化导致的图像对比度差异，但底层自旋物理属性（质子密度、T1、T2值）是相同的。

Method: 提出Reverse Imaging方法：1）通过求解非线性逆问题从观测图像逆向推断底层自旋属性；2）利用扩散模型学习mSASHA数据集的自旋属性先验分布；3）基于推断的自旋属性合成任意新序列的图像。

Result: 该方法能够从MR图像获得有意义的自旋属性估计，作为可解释的潜在变量，实现高度灵活的图像合成，在不同图像对比度和成像协议下实现高精度分割。

Conclusion: Reverse Imaging通过物理驱动的数据增强和域适应方法，从根本上解决了心脏MRI分割的泛化问题，实现了宽谱泛化能力。

Abstract: Pretrained segmentation models for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
struggle to generalize across different imaging sequences due to significant
variations in image contrast. These variations arise from changes in imaging
protocols, yet the same fundamental spin properties, including proton density,
T1, and T2 values, govern all acquired images. With this core principle, we
introduce Reverse Imaging, a novel physics-driven method for cardiac MRI data
augmentation and domain adaptation to fundamentally solve the generalization
problem. Our method reversely infers the underlying spin properties from
observed cardiac MRI images, by solving ill-posed nonlinear inverse problems
regularized by the prior distribution of spin properties. We acquire this "spin
prior" by learning a generative diffusion model from the multiparametric
SAturation-recovery single-SHot acquisition sequence (mSASHA) dataset, which
offers joint cardiac T1 and T2 maps. Our method enables approximate but
meaningful spin-property estimates from MR images, which provide an
interpretable "latent variable" that lead to highly flexible image synthesis of
arbitrary novel sequences. We show that Reverse Imaging enables highly accurate
segmentation across vastly different image contrasts and imaging protocols,
realizing wide-spectrum generalization of cardiac MRI segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHD是一种新颖的个性化3D人体网格恢复方法，通过用户特定形状信息来提高视频姿态估计精度，使用点扩散变换器作为形状条件3D姿态先验来指导姿态拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HMR方法追求通用性但忽略了用户特定体型信息，过度依赖2D约束会损害3D精度，需要同时考虑个体体型和3D姿态合理性。

Method: 首先校准用户体型，然后基于该体型进行个性化姿态拟合，使用点扩散变换器实现形状条件3D姿态先验，通过点蒸馏采样损失迭代指导拟合过程。

Result: 方法不仅提高了骨盆对齐姿态精度，还改善了绝对姿态精度，仅需合成数据训练，可作为即插即用模块提升现有3D姿态估计器性能。

Conclusion: PHD通过解耦体型校准和姿态拟合过程，有效解决了传统方法过度依赖2D约束的问题，在数据效率和性能提升方面表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce PHD, a novel approach for personalized 3D human mesh recovery
(HMR) and body fitting that leverages user-specific shape information to
improve pose estimation accuracy from videos. Traditional HMR methods are
designed to be user-agnostic and optimized for generalization. While these
methods often refine poses using constraints derived from the 2D image to
improve alignment, this process compromises 3D accuracy by failing to jointly
account for person-specific body shapes and the plausibility of 3D poses. In
contrast, our pipeline decouples this process by first calibrating the user's
body shape and then employing a personalized pose fitting process conditioned
on that shape. To achieve this, we develop a body shape-conditioned 3D pose
prior, implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer, which iteratively guides
the pose fitting via a Point Distillation Sampling loss. This learned 3D pose
prior effectively mitigates errors arising from an over-reliance on 2D
constraints. Consequently, our approach improves not only pelvis-aligned pose
accuracy but also absolute pose accuracy -- an important metric often
overlooked by prior work. Furthermore, our method is highly data-efficient,
requiring only synthetic data for training, and serves as a versatile
plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D pose
estimators to enhance their performance. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的基于扩散模型的3D人体姿态估计框架，通过分层时间剪枝策略在保持运动动态的同时显著降低计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然能生成高质量3D人体姿态，但其迭代性和多假设需求导致计算成本过高，需要一种高效的推理方法

Method: 采用分层时间剪枝(HTP)策略：1)时间相关性增强剪枝分析帧间运动相关性；2)稀疏聚焦时间MHSA利用帧级稀疏性减少注意力计算；3)掩码引导姿态令牌剪枝器通过聚类进行细粒度语义剪枝

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP数据集上，相比现有扩散方法，训练MACs减少38.5%，推理MACs减少56.8%，推理速度平均提升81.1%，同时达到最先进性能

Conclusion: HTP策略有效解决了扩散模型在3D人体姿态估计中的计算效率问题，在显著降低计算成本的同时保持了优异的性能表现

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating
high-fidelity 3D human poses, yet their iterative nature and multi-hypothesis
requirements incur substantial computational cost. In this paper, we propose an
Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation framework with a
Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) strategy, which dynamically prunes
redundant pose tokens across both frame and semantic levels while preserving
critical motion dynamics. HTP operates in a staged, top-down manner: (1)
Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) identifies essential frames by
analyzing inter-frame motion correlations through adaptive temporal graph
construction; (2) Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA) leverages the
resulting frame-level sparsity to reduce attention computation, focusing on
motion-relevant tokens; and (3) Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) performs
fine-grained semantic pruning via clustering, retaining only the most
informative pose tokens. Experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that
HTP reduces training MACs by 38.5\%, inference MACs by 56.8\%, and improves
inference speed by an average of 81.1\% compared to prior diffusion-based
methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Print2Volume是一个从2D指纹图像生成逼真合成OCT 3D指纹的新框架，通过生成大规模合成数据解决了OCT数据稀缺问题，显著提升了指纹识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OCT技术能够获取高分辨率3D指纹数据，但数据采集成本高、耗时长，导致大规模公开数据集稀缺，严重阻碍了深度学习模型的发展。

Method: 框架包含三个阶段：1）2D风格转换模块将二值指纹转为灰度图像；2）3D结构扩展网络将2D图像外推为3D解剖体积；3）基于3D GAN的OCT真实性细化器添加真实纹理和噪声特征。

Result: 生成了42万个合成样本的大规模数据集，通过在合成数据上预训练并在小规模真实数据上微调，将ZJUT-EIFD基准的等错误率从15.62%显著降低到2.50%。

Conclusion: Print2Volume框架有效解决了OCT指纹数据稀缺问题，生成的合成数据质量高，能显著提升指纹识别性能，为数据驱动的生物识别算法发展提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables the acquisition of
high-resolution, three-dimensional fingerprint data, capturing rich subsurface
structures for robust biometric recognition. However, the high cost and
time-consuming nature of OCT data acquisition have led to a scarcity of
large-scale public datasets, significantly hindering the development of
advanced algorithms, particularly data-hungry deep learning models. To address
this critical bottleneck, this paper introduces Print2Volume, a novel framework
for generating realistic, synthetic OCT-based 3D fingerprints from 2D
fingerprint image. Our framework operates in three sequential stages: (1) a 2D
style transfer module that converts a binary fingerprint into a grayscale
images mimicking the style of a Z-direction mean-projected OCT scan; (2) a 3D
Structure Expansion Network that extrapolates the 2D im-age into a plausible 3D
anatomical volume; and (3) an OCT Realism Refiner, based on a 3D GAN, that
renders the structural volume with authentic textures, speckle noise, and other
imaging characteristics. Using Print2Volume, we generated a large-scale
synthetic dataset of 420,000 samples. Quantitative experiments demonstrate the
high quality of our synthetic data and its significant impact on recognition
performance. By pre-training a recognition model on our synthetic data and
fine-tuning it on a small real-world dataset, we achieved a remarkable
reduction in the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 15.62% to 2.50% on the ZJUT-EIFD
benchmark, proving the effectiveness of our approach in overcoming data
scarcity.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Gynecologic laparoscopy as a type of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is
performed via a live feed of a patient's abdomen surveying the insertion and
handling of various instruments for conducting treatment. Adopting this kind of
surgical intervention not only facilitates a great variety of treatments, the
possibility of recording said video streams is as well essential for numerous
post-surgical activities, such as treatment planning, case documentation and
education. Nonetheless, the process of manually analyzing surgical recordings,
as it is carried out in current practice, usually proves tediously
time-consuming. In order to improve upon this situation, more sophisticated
computer vision as well as machine learning approaches are actively developed.
Since most of such approaches heavily rely on sample data, which especially in
the medical field is only sparsely available, with this work we publish the
Gynecologic Laparoscopy ENdometriosis DAtaset (GLENDA) - an image dataset
containing region-based annotations of a common medical condition named
endometriosis, i.e. the dislocation of uterine-like tissue. The dataset is the
first of its kind and it has been created in collaboration with leading medical
experts in the field.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了基于区域全卷积网络在腹腔镜妇科手术视频中进行手术器械实例分割和识别的性能，结果显示器械分割准确率较高但器械类型识别仍具挑战性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术视频记录已成为医学内窥镜领域的重要信息源，但自动内容索引（基于内容的医学视频存档搜索基础）由于视频内容的特殊性仍面临巨大挑战

Method: 使用基于区域的全卷积网络进行实例感知的(1)器械分割和(2)器械识别，前者进行二值分割（器械vs背景），后者进行多类别器械识别

Result: 即使训练样本数量适中，也能以较高准确率定位和分割器械区域，但确定具体器械类型仍然非常困难

Conclusion: 手术器械分割可以达到较高精度，但由于手术器械内在的高度相似性，器械类型识别仍然是一个重大挑战

Abstract: Recorded videos from surgeries have become an increasingly important
information source for the field of medical endoscopy, since the recorded
footage shows every single detail of the surgery. However, while video
recording is straightforward these days, automatic content indexing - the basis
for content-based search in a medical video archive - is still a great
challenge due to the very special video content. In this work, we investigate
segmentation and recognition of surgical instruments in videos recorded from
laparoscopic gynecology. More precisely, we evaluate the achievable performance
of segmenting surgical instruments from their background by using a
region-based fully convolutional network for instance-aware (1) instrument
segmentation as well as (2) instrument recognition. While the first part
addresses only binary segmentation of instances (i.e., distinguishing between
instrument or background) we also investigate multi-class instrument
recognition (i.e., identifying the type of instrument). Our evaluation results
show that even with a moderately low number of training examples, we are able
to localize and segment instrument regions with a pretty high accuracy.
However, the results also reveal that determining the particular instrument is
still very challenging, due to the inherently high similarity of surgical
instruments.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful tool for remote sensing,
where large amounts of unlabeled data are available. In this work, we
investigate the use of DINO, a contrastive self-supervised method, for
pretraining on remote sensing imagery. We introduce SatDINO, a model tailored
for representation learning in satellite imagery. Through extensive experiments
on multiple datasets in multiple testing setups, we demonstrate that SatDINO
outperforms other state-of-the-art methods based on much more common masked
autoencoders (MAE) and achieves competitive results in multiple benchmarks.
  We also provide a rigorous ablation study evaluating SatDINO's individual
components. Finally, we propose a few novel enhancements, such as a new way to
incorporate ground sample distance (GSD) encoding and adaptive view sampling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 整片正切图像（WSI）在AI算法开发中至关重要，但目前缺乏标准的元数据标准，大规模集合的手动检查效率低下，影响AI算法训练和验证的组织选择。

Method: 提出一个通用框架，生成WSI的2D索引地图，并针对特定应用领域进行配置。通过三层组织结构（来源、组织类型、病理改变）构建详细的组织地图，使用统一语法和语义实现不同目录间的互操性。

Result: 在临床病理学领域进行了实践展示，通过WSI目录、机器学习和图象表示等具体例子证明了该标准的优势和适用性。

Conclusion: 该框架为WSI集成了详细的组织地图，提供了细粒度的图像内容信息，有效解决了大规模WSI集合中手动检查的效率问题，促进了不同目录间的互操性和AI算法的发展。

Abstract: A Whole Slide Image (WSI) is a high-resolution digital image created by
scanning an entire glass slide containing a biological specimen, such as tissue
sections or cell samples, at multiple magnifications. These images can be
viewed, analyzed, shared digitally, and are used today for Artificial
Intelligence (AI) algorithm development. WSIs are used in a variety of fields,
including pathology for diagnosing diseases and oncology for cancer research.
They are also utilized in neurology, veterinary medicine, hematology,
microbiology, dermatology, pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, and forensic
science.
  When assembling cohorts for the training or validation of an AI algorithm, it
is essential to know what is present on such a WSI. However, there is currently
no standard for this metadata, so such selection has mainly been done through
manual inspection, which is not suitable for large collections with several
million objects.
  We propose a general framework to generate a 2D index map for WSI and a
profiling mechanism for specific application domains. We demonstrate this
approach in the field of clinical pathology, using common syntax and semantics
to achieve interoperability between different catalogs.
  Our approach augments each WSI collection with a detailed tissue map that
provides fine-grained information about the WSI content. The tissue map is
organized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations,
with each layer assigning segments of the WSI to specific classes.
  We illustrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed standard
through specific examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning (ML), and
graph-based WSI representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中经常出现训练时未见的新类别，传统增量学习方法需要完全标注的增量数据集，这在实践中不现实

Method: 使用置信度伪标签替代人工标注，将伪标签集成到各种CIL方法中，采用置信度选择策略

Result: 在CIFAR100和ImageNet100上评估性能下降，与class-iNCD方法比较，在细粒度数据集验证实用性，计算复杂度适合资源受限环境

Conclusion: ICPL方法在无监督设置下取得了与有监督方法竞争的结果，显著优于现有的class-iNCD方法

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many
computer vision tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, novel classes that
were unseen during training often emerge, requiring models to acquire new
knowledge incrementally. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) methods enable a
model to learn novel classes while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
However, these methods make the strong assumption that the incremental dataset
is fully labeled, which is unrealistic in practice. In this work, we propose an
unsupervised Incremental Learning method using Confidence-based Pseudo-labels
(ICPL), which replaces human annotations with pseudo-labels, enabling
incremental learning from unlabeled datasets. We integrate these pseudo-labels
into various CIL methods with confidence-based selection and evaluate
performance degradation on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100. Then, we compare our
approach to popular Class Incremental Novel Category Discovery (class-iNCD)
methods addressing similar challenges. Additionally, we apply our method to
fine-grained datasets to demonstrate its real-world practicality and measure
its computational complexity to validate its suitability for
resource-constrained environments. ICPL achieves competitive results compared
to supervised methods and outperforms state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by
more than 5% in final accuracy.

Abstract: Synthetic medical data offers a scalable solution for training robust models,
but significant domain gaps limit its generalizability to real-world clinical
settings. This paper addresses the challenge of cross-domain translation
between synthetic and real X-ray images of the head, focusing on bridging
discrepancies in attenuation behavior, noise characteristics, and soft tissue
representation. We propose MedShift, a unified class-conditional generative
model based on Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges, which enables
high-fidelity, unpaired image translation across multiple domains. Unlike prior
approaches that require domain-specific training or rely on paired data,
MedShift learns a shared domain-agnostic latent space and supports seamless
translation between any pair of domains seen during training. We introduce
X-DigiSkull, a new dataset comprising aligned synthetic and real skull X-rays
under varying radiation doses, to benchmark domain translation models.
Experimental results demonstrate that, despite its smaller model size compared
to diffusion-based approaches, MedShift offers strong performance and remains
flexible at inference time, as it can be tuned to prioritize either perceptual
fidelity or structural consistency, making it a scalable and generalizable
solution for domain adaptation in medical imaging. The code and dataset are

Motivation: 现有全球产品主要关注二元树冠覆盖或冠层高度，无法在个体水平识别树木，大尺度单株树木监测因建模不足而受限。

Method: 使用深度学习方法和3米分辨率PlanetScope影像，通过可扩展大小的高斯核模拟树冠，从机载激光雷达数据自动提取数十亿个点进行训练。

Abstract: Trees are key components of the terrestrial biosphere, playing vital roles in
ecosystem function, climate regulation, and the bioeconomy. However,
large-scale monitoring of individual trees remains limited by inadequate
modelling. Available global products have focused on binary tree cover or
canopy height, which do not explicitely identify trees at individual level. In
this study, we present a deep learning approach for detecting large individual
trees in 3-m resolution PlanetScope imagery at a global scale. We simulate tree
crowns with Gaussian kernels of scalable size, allowing the extraction of crown
centers and the generation of binary tree cover maps. Training is based on
billions of points automatically extracted from airborne lidar data, enabling
the model to successfully identify trees both inside and outside forests. We
compare against existing tree cover maps and airborne lidar with
state-of-the-art performance (fractional cover R$^2 = 0.81$ against aerial
lidar), report balanced detection metrics across biomes, and demonstrate how
detection can be further improved through fine-tuning with manual labels. Our
method offers a scalable framework for global, high-resolution tree monitoring,
and is adaptable to future satellite missions offering improved imagery.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-fidelity real-time rendering, a key
requirement for immersive applications. However, the extension of 3DGS to
dynamic scenes remains limitations on the substantial data volume of dense
Gaussians and the prolonged training time required for each frame. This paper
presents \M, a scalable Gaussian Splatting framework designed for efficient
training in streaming tasks. Specifically, Gaussian spheres are hierarchically
organized by scale within an anchor-based structure. Coarser-level Gaussians
represent the low-resolution structure of the scene, while finer-level
Gaussians, responsible for detailed high-fidelity rendering, are selectively
activated by the coarser-level Gaussians. To further reduce computational
overhead, we introduce a hybrid deformation and spawning strategy that models
motion of inter-frame through Gaussian deformation and triggers Gaussian
spawning to characterize wide-range motion. Additionally, a bidirectional
adaptive masking mechanism enhances training efficiency by removing static
regions and prioritizing informative viewpoints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that \M~ achieves superior visual quality while significantly
reducing training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在本地设备部署时的高计算需求问题，开发轻量级但性能优越的图像描述模型。

Method: 基于125M参数语言模型构建专家模型，并通过DeepLens提取详细视觉表示，采用Sharp-Eyed Refinement框架增强视觉定位能力。

Conclusion: 轻量级专家模型可作为设备端应用的强大视觉专家，Sharp-Eyed Refinement框架显著提升了描述质量。

Abstract: Image captioning is fundamental for applications like video instruction
systems and exploration robots, yet deploying such models on local devices is
challenging due to the high computational demands of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). To address this, we first explore lightweight captioning by
implementing a specialist based on a 125M-parameter language model, 56 times
smaller than LLaMA-7B, and evaluating its performance on both single-sentence
and detailed captioning tasks. Surprisingly, we find that our model can achieve
performance comparable to large multimodal generalists, suggesting its
potential to serve as a strong visual specialist for on-device applications.
While promising, our model also exhibits a limitation: like other MLLMs, it
suffers from visual blindness, occasionally resulting in semantic captioning
errors. We carry out toy experiments and investigate the underlying causes,
where we observe that the problems arise from ineffective attention mechanisms
and limited visual representations. To alleviate them, we develop a novel
captioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption quality
through improved visual grounding. At its core, our DeepLens extracts detailed
visual representations by concentrating on informative regions identified
during the initial glance. Our experiments confirm both the advantages of our
specialist over prior small captioning models and large generalists and the
effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: While foundation models (FMs) offer strong potential for AI-based dementia
diagnosis, their integration into federated learning (FL) systems remains
underexplored. In this benchmarking study, we systematically evaluate the
impact of key design choices: classification head architecture, fine-tuning
strategy, and aggregation method, on the performance and efficiency of
federated FM tuning using brain MRI data. Using a large multi-cohort dataset,
we find that the architecture of the classification head substantially
influences performance, freezing the FM encoder achieves comparable results to
full fine-tuning, and advanced aggregation methods outperform standard
federated averaging. Our results offer practical insights for deploying FMs in
decentralized clinical settings and highlight trade-offs that should guide
future method development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法要么只关注单一技术家族，要么在特定类型OOD数据集上评估，忽略了结合多种现有解决方案的潜力

Method: 提出多方法集成(MME)评分，将最先进的OOD检测器统一为单一更有效的评分函数，结合特征截断和多种评分函数

Result: 在大型和小型基准测试中，MME在所有基准上都显著优于最新方法，在ImageNet-1K基准上平均FPR95达到27.57%，比现有最佳基线提升6%

Conclusion: 理论分析和实验证明，最先进的特征截断和评分函数可以有效地结合，集成多种评分函数能增强对各种类型OOD样本的鲁棒性

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for neural networks
operating in open-world settings, particularly in safety-critical applications.
Existing methods have improved OOD detection by leveraging two main techniques:
feature truncation, which increases the separation between in-distribution (ID)
and OOD samples, and scoring functions, which assign scores to distinguish
between ID and OOD data. However, most approaches either focus on a single
family of techniques or evaluate their effectiveness on a specific type of OOD
dataset, overlooking the potential of combining multiple existing solutions.
Motivated by this observation, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate
that state-of-the-art feature truncation and scoring functions can be
effectively combined. Moreover, we show that aggregating multiple scoring
functions enhances robustness against various types of OOD samples. Based on
these insights, we propose the Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) score, which unifies
state-of-the-art OOD detectors into a single, more effective scoring function.
Extensive experiments on both large-scale and small-scale benchmarks, covering
near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios, show that MME significantly outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks. Notably, using the BiT model,
our method achieves an average FPR95 of 27.57% on the challenging ImageNet-1K
benchmark, improving performance by 6% over the best existing baseline.

Conclusion: 通过局部增强方法减少背景干扰，能够更有效地提高对船舶检测模型的对抗表示例攻击性能。

Abstract: Current ship detection techniques based on remote sensing imagery primarily
rely on the object detection capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs).
However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, which can lead to
misclassification by the detection model or complete evasion of the targets.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that data transformation-based methods can
improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, excessive
augmentation of image backgrounds or irrelevant regions may introduce
unnecessary interference, resulting in false detections of the object detection
model. These errors are not caused by the adversarial patches themselves but
rather by the over-augmentation of background and non-target areas. This paper
proposes a localized augmentation method that applies augmentation only to the
target regions, avoiding any influence on non-target areas. By reducing
background interference, this approach enables the loss function to focus more
directly on the impact of the adversarial patch on the detection model, thereby
improving the attack success rate. Experiments conducted on the HRSC2016
dataset demonstrate that the proposed method effectively increases the success
rate of adversarial patch attacks and enhances their transferability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个针对长视频幻觉的基准ELV-Halluc，专门研究语义聚合幻觉(SAH)，发现SAH随语义复杂度增加而加剧，并通过位置编码和DPO策略显著减少了27.7%的SAH比例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频多模态大语言模型在视频理解方面取得显著进展，但仍容易产生与视频输入不一致或无关的幻觉。之前的基准主要关注短视频，忽略了长视频中由于语义复杂度增加而产生的语义聚合幻觉问题。

Method: 引入ELV-Halluc基准系统研究SAH，通过实验验证SAH的存在及其与语义复杂度的关系，采用位置编码策略和DPO（直接偏好优化）策略来缓解SAH，并构建了8K对抗数据对数据集。

Result: 实验证实了SAH的存在，显示SAH随语义复杂度增加而增加，模型在快速变化的语义上更容易产生SAH。通过提出的方法，在ELV-Halluc和Video-MME基准上都取得了改进，SAH比例大幅降低了27.7%。

Conclusion: 长视频中的语义聚合幻觉是一个重要但被忽视的问题，需要专门的研究和缓解策略。位置编码和DPO策略能有效减少SAH，为提升视频多模态大语言模型的可靠性提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Video multimodal large language models (Video-MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, they remain vulnerable to
hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs.
Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They
attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing
frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these
causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still
oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect
outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of
hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during
the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic
groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to
increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to
separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination.
To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark
dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of
SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases
with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to
SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to
mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to
alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability
to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a
dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both
ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.

Motivation: 现有的基于patch的基础模型特征在显微镜图像分析中存在两个主要问题：1) 难以表示微结构中的精细特征 2) 对大尺寸图像处理效率低

Method: 训练卷积神经网络将低分辨率的基础模型特征参考输入图像进行上采样，无需额外训练即可应用于多种显微镜图像的特征提取和分割

Result: 上采样后的丰富特征能够分离难以分割的相（如发丝裂纹），交互式分割相比传统卷积网络需要更少的标签和更快的速度就能产生高质量分割结果

Conclusion: 该方法为显微镜图像分析提供了一种高效的特征增强方案，显著提升了分割精度和效率，在材料科学和生物图像分析中具有重要应用价值

Abstract: Feature foundation models - usually vision transformers - offer rich semantic
descriptors of images, useful for downstream tasks such as (interactive)
segmentation and object detection. For computational efficiency these
descriptors are often patch-based, and so struggle to represent the fine
features often present in micrographs; they also struggle with the large image
sizes present in materials and biological image analysis. In this work, we
train a convolutional neural network to upsample low-resolution (i.e, large
patch size) foundation model features with reference to the input image. We
apply this upsampler network (without any further training) to efficiently
featurise and then segment a variety of microscopy images, including plant
cells, a lithium-ion battery cathode and organic crystals. The richness of
these upsampled features admits separation of hard to segment phases, like
hairline cracks. We demonstrate that interactive segmentation with these deep
features produces high-quality segmentations far faster and with far fewer
labels than training or finetuning a more traditional convolutional network.

Motivation: 无人机场景中宽视野和复杂组合语义对视觉语言理解带来挑战，主流VLM模型缺乏细粒度语义，现有分层方法依赖精确实体划分，在动态环境中效果有限。

Conclusion: HCCM框架有效解决了无人机场景中的视觉语言理解挑战，在细粒度语义捕获和组合推理方面表现出色，具有很强的零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: Natural Language-Guided Drones (NLGD) provide a novel paradigm for tasks such
as target matching and navigation. However, the wide field of view and complex
compositional semantics in drone scenarios pose challenges for vision-language
understanding. Mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs) emphasize global
alignment while lacking fine-grained semantics, and existing hierarchical
methods depend on precise entity partitioning and strict containment, limiting
effectiveness in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose the
Hierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching learning (HCCM)
framework with two components: (1) Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive
Learning (RG-ITC), which avoids precise scene partitioning and captures
hierarchical local-to-global semantics by contrasting local visual regions with
global text and vice versa; (2) Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM),
which dispenses with rigid constraints and instead evaluates local semantic
consistency within global cross-modal representations, enhancing compositional
reasoning. Moreover, drone text descriptions are often incomplete or ambiguous,
destabilizing alignment. HCCM introduces a Momentum Contrast and Distillation
(MCD) mechanism to improve robustness. Experiments on GeoText-1652 show HCCM
achieves state-of-the-art Recall@1 of 28.8% (image retrieval) and 14.7% (text
retrieval). On the unseen ERA dataset, HCCM demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization with 39.93% mean recall (mR), outperforming fine-tuned
baselines.

Conclusion: 通过生成式模型方法有效解决了从单张图像重建完整3D场景的挑战，特别是在遮挡区域的多样化重建方面取得了显著进步

Abstract: Gaussian splatting typically requires dense observations of the scene and can
fail to reconstruct occluded and unobserved areas. We propose a latent
diffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats,
including the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference.
Completing the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the
ambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a
regression-based formulation to predict a single "mode" for occluded and
out-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to
capture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem
partially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background,
reconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the
input views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a
distribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single
input image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a
Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a
self-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method
generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to
complete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings.

Abstract: Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each
character and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character
segmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in
sequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first
detecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly
output full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of
language models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe
that the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word
segmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical
progression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to
bypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for
better utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not
only improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough
literature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark
such shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a
meticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level
annotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy
improvement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning
towards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4
times improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines. With
continuous improvements in large language models, our methodology also holds
potential to exploit such advances. Project Website:

Conclusion: 结合CLIP先验知识和不确定性感知采样，为成对排序提供了高效可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Pairwise comparison is often favored over absolute rating or ordinal
classification in subjective or difficult annotation tasks due to its improved
reliability. However, exhaustive comparisons require a massive number of
annotations (O(n^2)). Recent work has greatly reduced the annotation burden
(O(n log n)) by actively sampling pairwise comparisons using a sorting
algorithm. We further improve annotation efficiency by (1) roughly pre-ordering
items using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model
hierarchically without training, and (2) replacing easy, obvious human
comparisons with automated comparisons. The proposed EZ-Sort first produces a
CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, then initializes bucket-aware Elo scores,
and finally runs an uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation
was conducted using various datasets: face-age estimation (FGNET), historical
image chronology (DHCI), and retinal image quality assessment (EyePACS). It
showed that EZ-Sort reduced human annotation cost by 90.5% compared to
exhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to prior work (when n =
100), while improving or maintaining inter-rater reliability. These results
demonstrate that combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling
yields an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking.

Abstract: Modeling human-object interactions (HOI) from an egocentric perspective is a
largely unexplored yet important problem due to the increasing adoption of
wearable devices, such as smart glasses and watches. We investigate how much
information about interaction can be recovered from only head and wrists
tracking. Our answer is ECHO (Ego-Centric modeling of Human-Object
interactions), which, for the first time, proposes a unified framework to
recover three modalities: human pose, object motion, and contact from such
minimal observation. ECHO employs a Diffusion Transformer architecture and a
unique three-variate diffusion process, which jointly models human motion,
object trajectory, and contact sequence, allowing for flexible input
configurations. Our method operates in a head-centric canonical space,
enhancing robustness to global orientation. We propose a conveyor-based
inference, which progressively increases the diffusion timestamp with the frame
position, allowing us to process sequences of any length. Through extensive
evaluation, we demonstrate that ECHO outperforms existing methods that do not
offer the same flexibility, setting a state-of-the-art in egocentric HOI
reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了视觉-语言模型在城市场景空间推理上的性能，通过综合分析和细调三个常见VLM模型，并使用合成的链式思绪VQA数据集来提升模型在具体领域的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉-语言模型在通用场景上领域训练后，在城市领域的细粒度空间推理能力上的转移效果仍不明确，需要系统性的评估和改进方法。

Method: 选取BLIP-2、InstructBLIP和LLaVA-1.5三个现有VLM模型，进行零样本性能测试，并使用从街景图像的分割、深度和物体检测预测构建的合成VQA数据集进行细调。数据集包含由大语言模型生成的链式思绪答案，以支持步骤化推理。

Result: 零样本情况下VLMs表现谨慎但可接受，但通过使用合成链式思绪数据集进行细调后，性能得到显著提升，尤其是在否定和反事实类问题上。

Conclusion: 研究将城市空间推理定义为VLM的新挑战，并证明了使用合成数据集来适配通用模型到专业领域的可行性。

Abstract: Effectively understanding urban scenes requires fine-grained spatial
reasoning about objects, layouts, and depth cues. However, how well current
vision-language models (VLMs), pretrained on general scenes, transfer these
abilities to urban domain remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
conduct a comparative study of three off-the-shelf VLMs-BLIP-2, InstructBLIP,
and LLaVA-1.5-evaluating both zero-shot performance and the effects of
fine-tuning with a synthetic VQA dataset specific to urban scenes. We construct
such dataset from segmentation, depth, and object detection predictions of
street-view images, pairing each question with LLM-generated Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) answers for step-by-step reasoning supervision. Results show that while
VLMs perform reasonably well in zero-shot settings, fine-tuning with our
synthetic CoT-supervised dataset substantially boosts performance, especially
for challenging question types such as negation and counterfactuals. This study
introduces urban spatial reasoning as a new challenge for VLMs and demonstrates
synthetic dataset construction as a practical path for adapting general-purpose
models to specialized domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Temporal Flow Matching (TFM)方法，用于医学图像时间动态建模，支持3D体积、多先验扫描和不规则采样，在三个公共纵向数据集上达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法大多只考虑单一时间上下文，或局限于分类回归任务，无法进行细粒度空间预测，存在技术限制

Method: Temporal Flow Matching (TFM) - 统一的生成轨迹方法，学习底层时间分布，支持回退到最近图像预测器，支持3D体积、多先验扫描和不规则采样

Result: 在三个公共纵向数据集上的广泛基准测试显示，TFM始终超越自然成像中的时空方法，为4D医学图像预测建立了新的最先进和鲁棒基线

Conclusion: TFM方法有效解决了医学图像时间动态建模的根本性差距，为疾病进展建模和治疗规划等应用提供了强大的统一框架

Abstract: Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for
applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and
anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either
consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification
or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions.
While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single
timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address
this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified
generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal
distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e.
predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports
$3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive
benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently
surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new
state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了整合术前CT和术后病理WSI的多模态深度学习模型在透明细胞肾癌复发预测中的表现，发现中间融合策略效果最佳，接近临床基准Leibovich评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 透明细胞肾癌复发风险预测对术后监测和治疗指导至关重要，但现有Leibovich评分存在患者层面分辨率有限且缺乏影像信息的局限性。

Method: 采用模块化深度学习框架，使用预训练编码器和基于Cox的生存模型，测试了单模态、晚期融合和中间融合三种设置。

Result: 病理WSI模型始终优于仅CT模型，中间融合进一步改善性能，最佳模型接近调整后的Leibovich评分。随机平局处理缩小了临床基线学习模型之间的差距。

Conclusion: 证明了基于基础模型的多模态整合在个性化ccRCC风险预测中的可行性，未来需探索更具表现力的融合策略、更大数据集和通用CT编码器。

Abstract: Recurrence risk estimation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is
essential for guiding postoperative surveillance and treatment. The Leibovich
score remains widely used for stratifying distant recurrence risk but offers
limited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information. This study
evaluates multimodal recurrence prediction by integrating preoperative computed
tomography (CT) and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). A
modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival
modeling was tested across unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion
setups. In a real-world ccRCC cohort, WSI-based models consistently
outperformed CT-only models, underscoring the prognostic strength of pathology.
Intermediate fusion further improved performance, with the best model
(TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18) approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Random
tie-breaking narrowed the gap between the clinical baseline and learned models,
suggesting discretization may overstate individualized performance. Using
simple embedding concatenation, radiology added value primarily through fusion.
These findings demonstrate the feasibility of foundation model-based multimodal
integration for personalized ccRCC risk prediction. Future work should explore
more expressive fusion strategies, larger multimodal datasets, and
general-purpose CT encoders to better match pathology modeling capacity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有深度学习CGH算法存在的三个主要问题：结构黑盒化影响解释性、CNN模型感知野有限、ASM模型限于近场范围。

Method: 提出深度展开网络(DUN)，将梯度下降分解为两个模块：适应带宽保持模型(ABPM)和相位域复杂值去噪器(PCD)。ABPM支持更宽的工作距离，PCD利用复杂值可变形自注意力模块捕捉全局特征。

Result: 在模拟和实际数据上达到了独创的结果，平均峰值信噪比(PSNR)超过35dB。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了更好的灵活性和解释性，能够在更宽的工作距离下捕捉全局特征，为CGH领域提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) has gained wide attention with deep
learning-based algorithms. However, due to its nonlinear and ill-posed nature,
challenges remain in achieving accurate and stable reconstruction.
Specifically, ($i$) the widely used end-to-end networks treat the
reconstruction model as a black box, ignoring underlying physical
relationships, which reduces interpretability and flexibility. ($ii$) CNN-based
CGH algorithms have limited receptive fields, hindering their ability to
capture long-range dependencies and global context. ($iii$) Angular spectrum
method (ASM)-based models are constrained to finite near-fields.In this paper,
we propose a Deep Unfolding Network (DUN) that decomposes gradient descent into
two modules: an adaptive bandwidth-preserving model (ABPM) and a phase-domain
complex-valued denoiser (PCD), providing more flexibility. ABPM allows for
wider working distances compared to ASM-based methods. At the same time, PCD
leverages its complex-valued deformable self-attention module to capture global
features and enhance performance, achieving a PSNR over 35 dB. Experiments on
simulated and real data show state-of-the-art results.

Motivation: 解决全身PET/CT中由于示踪剂异质性、生理性摄取和多中心变异性导致的病灶分割挑战，开发能够保持人机交互的高效分割方法

Method: 扩展autoPET III nnU-Net框架，将用户提供的前景和背景点击编码为额外输入通道，系统研究空间提示表示方法，提出在线模拟用户交互和自定义点采样策略

Result: 基于EDT的集成模型在交叉验证中表现最强，相比基线模型减少了假阳性和假阴性，在真实提示条件下具有更好的鲁棒性

Conclusion: 可提示模型在多示踪剂、多中心PET/CT中具有实现高效用户引导分割工作流程的潜力

Abstract: Whole-body PET/CT is a cornerstone of oncological imaging, yet accurate
lesion segmentation remains challenging due to tracer heterogeneity,
physiological uptake, and multi-center variability. While fully automated
methods have advanced substantially, clinical practice benefits from approaches
that keep humans in the loop to efficiently refine predicted masks. The
autoPET/CT IV challenge addresses this need by introducing interactive
segmentation tasks based on simulated user prompts. In this work, we present
our submission to Task 1. Building on the winning autoPET III nnU-Net pipeline,
we extend the framework with promptable capabilities by encoding user-provided
foreground and background clicks as additional input channels. We
systematically investigate representations for spatial prompts and demonstrate
that Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) encodings consistently outperform
Gaussian kernels. Furthermore, we propose online simulation of user
interactions and a custom point sampling strategy to improve robustness under
realistic prompting conditions. Our ensemble of EDT-based models, trained with
and without external data, achieves the strongest cross-validation performance,
reducing both false positives and false negatives compared to baseline models.
These results highlight the potential of promptable models to enable efficient,
user-guided segmentation workflows in multi-tracer, multi-center PET/CT. Code

Motivation: 现有HD地图构建方法使用基于注意力的标准映射技术存在泛化问题，经常产生不存在的道路元素幻觉，需要更准确的图像到BEV空间映射方法

Method: 提出新颖的概率投影机制：1）基于相机参数的几何映射 2）使用置信度评分优化映射对齐 3）过滤不相关元素 4）选择性累积时序可靠信息

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse2数据集的新划分上表现优于最先进方法，特别是在nuScenes和长感知距离挑战场景中改进显著，显示出更好的泛化能力

Conclusion: 基于几何先验和概率置信度机制的映射方法能够有效提高HD地图构建的准确性和鲁棒性，解决了现有方法的幻觉问题

Abstract: Constructing high-definition (HD) maps from sensory input requires accurately
mapping the road elements in image space to the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space.
The precision of this mapping directly impacts the quality of the final
vectorized HD map. Existing HD mapping approaches outsource the projection to
standard mapping techniques, such as attention-based ones. However, these
methods struggle with accuracy due to generalization problems, often
hallucinating non-existent road elements. Our key idea is to start with a
geometric mapping based on camera parameters and adapt it to the scene to
extract relevant map information from camera images. To implement this, we
propose a novel probabilistic projection mechanism with confidence scores to
(i) refine the mapping to better align with the scene and (ii) filter out
irrelevant elements that should not influence HD map generation. In addition,
we improve temporal processing by using confidence scores to selectively
accumulate reliable information over time. Experiments on new splits of the
nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate improved performance over
state-of-the-art approaches, indicating better generalization. The improvements
are particularly pronounced on nuScenes and in the challenging long perception
range. Our code and model checkpoints are available at

Motivation: 解决现有扩散模型需要企业级GPU和数千张合成图像的高资源需求问题，使合成数据生成更加实用和可访问。

Method: 使用Flux 1.1 Dev扩散模型，通过低秩适应（LoRA）进行微调，构建轻量级合成数据生成管道。

Result: 在7个不同目标检测数据集上，仅用500张合成图像训练的检测器性能优于使用5000张ODGEN基线合成图像的模型，mAP@.50:.95提升高达21.3%。

Conclusion: FLORA证明了质量和效率导向的方法比暴力生成更有效，仅用10%的数据和少量计算成本就能实现最先进性能，使高级合成数据创建更加实用。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated
significant potential in augmenting scarce datasets for object detection tasks.
Nevertheless, most recent models rely on resource-intensive full fine-tuning of
large-scale diffusion models, requiring enterprise-grade GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA
V100) and thousands of synthetic images. To address these limitations, we
propose Flux LoRA Augmentation (FLORA), a lightweight synthetic data generation
pipeline. Our approach uses the Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model, fine-tuned
exclusively through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This dramatically reduces
computational requirements, enabling synthetic dataset generation with a
consumer-grade GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090). We empirically evaluate our
approach on seven diverse object detection datasets. Our results demonstrate
that training object detectors with just 500 synthetic images generated by our
approach yields superior detection performance compared to models trained on
5000 synthetic images from the ODGEN baseline, achieving improvements of up to
21.3% in mAP@.50:.95. This work demonstrates that it is possible to surpass
state-of-the-art performance with far greater efficiency, as FLORA achieves
superior results using only 10% of the data and a fraction of the computational
cost. This work demonstrates that a quality and efficiency-focused approach is
more effective than brute-force generation, making advanced synthetic data
creation more practical and accessible for real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 通过监测CNN激活熵变化来检测对抗性攻击，无需修改模型即可实现90%检测准确率


<details>

Motivation: 现有对抗性攻击检测方法需要重新训练、修改网络架构或影响干净输入性能，需要一种无需模型修改的实时检测方案

Method: 在VGG-16网络上并行监测激活熵，发现对抗性输入在早期卷积层导致激活熵产生7%的偏移

Result: 实现了90%的检测准确率，假阳性和假阴性率均低于20%，干净和对抗性输入的熵分布完全分离

Conclusion: CNN可靠性可以通过激活熵单独评估，为实时自诊断视觉系统的实际部署提供了可行方案

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the foundation of modern
computer vision, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse image
recognition tasks. While these networks excel on in-distribution data, they
remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations imperceptible input
modifications that cause misclassification with high confidence. However,
existing detection methods either require expensive retraining, modify network
architecture, or degrade performance on clean inputs. Here we show that
adversarial perturbations create immediate, detectable entropy signatures in
CNN activations that can be monitored without any model modification. Using
parallel entropy monitoring on VGG-16, we demonstrate that adversarial inputs
consistently shift activation entropy by 7% in early convolutional layers,
enabling 90% detection accuracy with false positives and false negative rates
below 20%. The complete separation between clean and adversarial entropy
distributions reveals that CNNs inherently encode distribution shifts in their
activation patterns. This work establishes that CNN reliability can be assessed
through activation entropy alone, enabling practical deployment of
self-diagnostic vision systems that detect adversarial inputs in real-time
without compromising original model performance.

Conclusion: CAD2DMD-SET训练数据集显著提高了LVLMs在挑战性条件下的鲁棒性和性能，该工具将作为开源发布，供社区使用。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities across various multimodal tasks. They continue,
however, to struggle with trivial scenarios such as reading values from Digital
Measurement Devices (DMDs), particularly in real-world conditions involving
clutter, occlusions, extreme viewpoints, and motion blur; common in
head-mounted cameras and Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Motivated by
these limitations, this work introduces CAD2DMD-SET, a synthetic data
generation tool designed to support visual question answering (VQA) tasks
involving DMDs. By leveraging 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and
high-fidelity image composition, our tool produces diverse, VQA-labelled
synthetic DMD datasets suitable for fine-tuning LVLMs. Additionally, we present
DMDBench, a curated validation set of 1,000 annotated real-world images
designed to evaluate model performance under practical constraints.
Benchmarking three state-of-the-art LVLMs using Average Normalised Levenshtein
Similarity (ANLS) and further fine-tuning LoRA's of these models with
CAD2DMD-SET's generated dataset yielded substantial improvements, with InternVL
showcasing a score increase of 200% without degrading on other tasks. This
demonstrates that the CAD2DMD-SET training dataset substantially improves the
robustness and performance of LVLMs when operating under the previously stated
challenging conditions. The CAD2DMD-SET tool is expected to be released as
open-source once the final version of this manuscript is prepared, allowing the
community to add different measurement devices and generate their own datasets.

Conclusion: 通过引入负音频训练和新的评估指标，显著提升了视觉声源定位系统在真实复杂场景中的性能，为处理低音频-视觉语义对应情况提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Visual sound source localization is a fundamental perception task that aims
to detect the location of sounding sources in a video given its audio. Despite
recent progress, we identify two shortcomings in current methods: 1) most
approaches perform poorly in cases with low audio-visual semantic
correspondence such as silence, noise, and offscreen sounds, i.e. in the
presence of negative audio; and 2) most prior evaluations are limited to
positive cases, where both datasets and metrics convey scenarios with a single
visible sound source in the scene. To address this, we introduce three key
contributions. First, we propose a new training strategy that incorporates
silence and noise, which improves performance in positive cases, while being
more robust against negative sounds. Our resulting self-supervised model,
SSL-SaN, achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other
self-supervised models, both in sound localization and cross-modal retrieval.
Second, we propose a new metric that quantifies the trade-off between alignment
and separability of auditory and visual features across positive and negative
audio-visual pairs. Third, we present IS3+, an extended and improved version of
the IS3 synthetic dataset with negative audio.

Abstract: GUI agent aims to enable automated operations on Mobile/PC devices, which is
an important task toward achieving artificial general intelligence. The rapid
advancement of VLMs accelerates the development of GUI agents, owing to their
powerful capabilities in visual understanding and task planning. However,
building a GUI agent remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of
operation trajectories, the availability of interactive infrastructure, and the
limitation of initial capabilities in foundation models. In this work, we
introduce UItron, an open-source foundational model for automatic GUI agents,
featuring advanced GUI perception, grounding, and planning capabilities. UItron
highlights the necessity of systemic data engineering and interactive
infrastructure as foundational components for advancing GUI agent development.
It not only systematically studies a series of data engineering strategies to
enhance training effects, but also establishes an interactive environment
connecting both Mobile and PC devices. In training, UItron adopts supervised
finetuning over perception and planning tasks in various GUI scenarios, and
then develop a curriculum reinforcement learning framework to enable complex
reasoning and exploration for online environments. As a result, UItron achieves
superior performance in benchmarks of GUI perception, grounding, and planning.
In particular, UItron highlights the interaction proficiency with top-tier
Chinese mobile APPs, as we identified a general lack of Chinese capabilities
even in state-of-the-art solutions. To this end, we manually collect over one
million steps of operation trajectories across the top 100 most popular apps,
and build the offline and online agent evaluation environments. Experimental
results demonstrate that UItron achieves significant progress in Chinese app
scenarios, propelling GUI agents one step closer to real-world application.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有域泛化评估对基础模型如CLIP可能不够挑战性，因为其预训练数据可能已覆盖许多基准测试。需要更真实地评估CLIP在未见域数据上的性能。

Method: 提出CLIP-DCA方法：1）使用单独域头识别和增强CLIP编码器中的域感知能力；2）通过合成多样化域数据；3）鼓励域特征与分类特征的解耦来实现域不变分类。

Result: CLIP-DCA相比现有方法有显著改进，在更分布外的数据集上表现尤为突出，表明增强域感知有助于基础模型的域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 对于基础模型，增强域感知是有效域不变分类的前提，而非简单地强制域不变表示。解耦方法能更好地平衡域感知和分类性能。

Abstract: Evaluating domain generalization (DG) for foundational models like CLIP is
challenging, as web-scale pretraining data potentially covers many existing
benchmarks. Consequently, current DG evaluation may neither be sufficiently
challenging nor adequately test genuinely unseen data scenarios. To better
assess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP
encounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating
on 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after
fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget'
some domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance
deteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present
CLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware
representations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while
standard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant,
this can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of
domain-aware representations beneficial for generalization. We instead
hypothesize that enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective
domain-invariant classification in foundation models. CLIP-DCA identifies and
enhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head
and synthetically generated diverse domain data. Simultaneously, it encourages
domain-invariant classification through disentanglement from the domain
features. CLIP-DCA shows significant improvements within this challenging
evaluation compared to existing methods, particularly on datasets that are more
OOD.

Motivation: 人类在开放世界中展示出卓越的泛化和发现能力，而现有研究主要关注封闭集中的典型数据。本文旨在探索非典型视频数据对开放世界学习的潜在益处。

Method: 收集包含各种非典型视频数据（如科幻、动画等）的新数据集，并将其用于模型训练过程中的表示学习，重点关注OOD检测、新类别发现和零样本动作识别三个关键任务。

Result: 实验表明，即使使用简单的学习方法，非典型数据也能在各种设置下持续提升性能。增加非典型样本的类别多样性可进一步提升OOD检测性能，在NCD任务中，使用较小但语义更多样的非典型样本集比使用较大但更典型的数据集效果更好。

Conclusion: 非典型视频数据对开放世界视觉表示学习具有显著益处，新提出的数据集鼓励该方向的进一步研究。

Abstract: Humans usually show exceptional generalisation and discovery ability in the
open world, when being shown uncommon new concepts. Whereas most existing
studies in the literature focus on common typical data from closed sets,
open-world novel discovery is under-explored in videos. In this paper, we are
interested in asking: \textit{What if atypical unusual videos are exposed in
the learning process?} To this end, we collect a new video dataset consisting
of various types of unusual atypical data (\eg sci-fi, animation, \etc). To
study how such atypical data may benefit open-world learning, we feed them into
the model training process for representation learning. Focusing on three key
tasks in open-world learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, novel
category discovery (NCD), and zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR), we found
that even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently
improve performance across various settings. Furthermore, we found that
increasing the categorical diversity of the atypical samples further boosts OOD
detection performance. Additionally, in the NCD task, using a smaller yet more
semantically diverse set of atypical samples leads to better performance
compared to using a larger but more typical dataset. In the ZSAR setting, the
semantic diversity of atypical videos helps the model generalise better to
unseen action classes. These observations in our extensive experimental
evaluations reveal the benefits of atypical videos for visual representation
learning in the open world, together with the newly proposed dataset,
encouraging further studies in this direction.

*Nattapong Kurpukdee,Adrian G. Bors*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了无监督视频持续学习(uVCL)的新场景，使用无标签视频数据和非参数的核密度估计方法，通过动态内存扩展和知识转移来连续学习多个任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要集中在有监督持续学习，需要标签和任务边界信息，但实际应用中获取标签成本高且不实用。视频数据具有丰富的时空信息，但在无监督持续学习领域尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用无监督视频transformer网络提取深度嵌入特征，采用核密度估计(KDE)作为数据的非参数概率表示。引入新颖性检测标准动态扩展内存簇，利用先前任务的转移学习作为初始状态进行知识迁移。

Result: 在UCF101、HMDB51和Something-to-Something V2三个标准视频动作识别数据集上进行了深入评估，不使用任何标签或类别边界，证明该方法在连续学习多个任务时显著提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: 提出的无监督视频持续学习方法有效解决了视频数据处理的计算和内存挑战，为非参数学习提供了可行的解决方案，在无标签情况下成功实现了连续任务学习。

Abstract: We propose a realistic scenario for the unsupervised video learning where
neither task boundaries nor labels are provided when learning a succession of
tasks. We also provide a non-parametric learning solution for the
under-explored problem of unsupervised video continual learning. Videos
represent a complex and rich spatio-temporal media information, widely used in
many applications, but which have not been sufficiently explored in
unsupervised continual learning. Prior studies have only focused on supervised
continual learning, relying on the knowledge of labels and task boundaries,
while having labeled data is costly and not practical. To address this gap, we
study the unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL). uVCL raises more
challenges due to the additional computational and memory requirements of
processing videos when compared to images. We introduce a general benchmark
experimental protocol for uVCL by considering the learning of unstructured
video data categories during each task. We propose to use the Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features extracted by unsupervised
video transformer networks as a non-parametric probabilistic representation of
the data. We introduce a novelty detection criterion for the incoming new task
data, dynamically enabling the expansion of memory clusters, aiming to capture
new knowledge when learning a succession of tasks. We leverage the use of
transfer learning from the previous tasks as an initial state for the knowledge
transfer to the current learning task. We found that the proposed methodology
substantially enhances the performance of the model when successively learning
many tasks. We perform in-depth evaluations on three standard video action
recognition datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-to-Something V2,
without using any labels or class boundaries.

TL;DR: 基于nnU-Net框架，采用多阶段级联预训练策略，通过数据增强和模型集成方法，在胰腺导管腺癌MRI分割任务中取得了优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺导管腺癌MRI自动分割面临肿瘤组织对比度差和标注数据稀缺的挑战，需要开发在有限数据下高性能的专门化模型

Method: 使用nnU-Net框架，采用深度多阶段级联预训练策略：从通用解剖基础模型开始，依次在CT胰腺病变数据集和目标MRI模态上微调。通过五折交叉验证评估数据增强方案，构建定制化异构专家模型集成

Result: Task 1获得0.661的Tumor Dice分数，Task 2获得0.523的Tumor Dice分数。Task 1达到最先进的MASD 5.46 mm和HD95 17.33 mm边界精度

Conclusion: 提出了一种在有限数据和复杂医学成像任务中开发专门化高性能模型的稳健方法，通过度量感知集成策略有效解决了数据增强的权衡问题

Abstract: Automated segmentation of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from MRI is
critical for clinical workflows but is hindered by poor tumor-tissue contrast
and a scarcity of annotated data. This paper details our submission to the
PANTHER challenge, addressing both diagnostic T1-weighted (Task 1) and
therapeutic T2-weighted (Task 2) segmentation. Our approach is built upon the
nnU-Net framework and leverages a deep, multi-stage cascaded pre-training
strategy, starting from a general anatomical foundation model and sequentially
fine-tuning on CT pancreatic lesion datasets and the target MRI modalities.
Through extensive five-fold cross-validation, we systematically evaluated data
augmentation schemes and training schedules. Our analysis revealed a critical
trade-off, where aggressive data augmentation produced the highest volumetric
accuracy, while default augmentations yielded superior boundary precision
(achieving a state-of-the-art MASD of 5.46 mm and HD95 of 17.33 mm for Task 1).
For our final submission, we exploited this finding by constructing custom,
heterogeneous ensembles of specialist models, essentially creating a mix of
experts. This metric-aware ensembling strategy proved highly effective,
achieving a top cross-validation Tumor Dice score of 0.661 for Task 1 and 0.523
for Task 2. Our work presents a robust methodology for developing specialized,
high-performance models in the context of limited data and complex medical
imaging tasks (Team MIC-DKFZ).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPT-5在放射肿瘤学领域表现优异，在多项选择题测试中准确率达92.8%，显著超越GPT-4和GPT-3.5，在真实病例治疗建议生成中也获得较高评分，但仍需专家监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估GPT-5在临床决策支持，特别是放射肿瘤学领域的应用潜力，验证其在该专业领域的性能和可靠性。

Method: 使用两个基准测试：300道多项选择题的ACR放射肿瘤学培训考试，以及60个真实放射肿瘤学病例的治疗方案生成。由四位认证放射肿瘤学家评估正确性、全面性和幻觉现象。

Result: GPT-5在多项选择题测试中准确率92.8%，显著优于GPT-4(78.8%)和GPT-3.5(62.1%)。在病例评估中，正确性评分3.24/4，全面性评分3.59/4，幻觉现象罕见。

Conclusion: GPT-5在放射肿瘤学领域表现出色，但仍有改进空间，生成的建议需要严格的专家监督才能临床使用，特别是在复杂场景中容易出错。

Abstract: Introduction: Large language models (LLM) have shown great potential in
clinical decision support. GPT-5 is a novel LLM system that has been
specifically marketed towards oncology use.
  Methods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the
ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021), comprising 300
multiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation
oncologic vignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment
indications. For the vignette evaluation, GPT-5 was instructed to generate
concise therapeutic plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated
correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations. Inter-rater reliability was
quantified using Fleiss' \k{appa}.
  Results: On the TXIT benchmark, GPT-5 achieved a mean accuracy of 92.8%,
outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Domain-specific gains were
most pronounced in Dose and Diagnosis. In the vignette evaluation, GPT-5's
treatment recommendations were rated highly for correctness (mean 3.24/4, 95%
CI: 3.11-3.38) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4, 95% CI: 3.49-3.69).
Hallucinations were rare with no case reaching majority consensus for their
presence. Inter-rater agreement was low (Fleiss' \k{appa} 0.083 for
correctness), reflecting inherent variability in clinical judgment. Errors
clustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed
clinical adaptation.
  Discussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation
oncology multiple-choice benchmark. Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable
performance in generating real-world radiation oncology treatment
recommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for further improvement.
While hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors
underscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert
oversight before clinical implementation.

TL;DR: TMUAD提出三记忆库框架，通过文本记忆库、对象级图像记忆库和补丁级记忆库的统一协作，实现了结构和逻辑异常检测的最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测方法主要依赖精心设计的图像特征提取器和记忆库来捕捉对象间的逻辑关系，但在正常数据有限的情况下，逻辑异常检测仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 提出三记忆库框架：1）类级文本记忆库用于逻辑异常检测；2）对象级图像记忆库保留完整对象轮廓；3）补丁级记忆库用于结构异常检测。通过多级检索和比较计算异常分数并融合。

Result: 在涉及工业和医疗领域的七个公开数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过协作记忆库统一结构和逻辑异常检测，TMUAD框架有效解决了正常数据有限情况下的异常检测挑战。

Abstract: Anomaly detection, which aims to identify anomalies deviating from normal
patterns, is challenging due to the limited amount of normal data available.
Unlike most existing unified methods that rely on carefully designed image
feature extractors and memory banks to capture logical relationships between
objects, we introduce a text memory bank to enhance the detection of logical
anomalies. Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified
structural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level
text memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text
extractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input
images. Second, we construct an object-level image memory bank that preserves
complete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects. Third,
we employ visual encoders to extract patch-level image features for
constructing a patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection. These
three complementary memory banks are used to retrieve and compare normal images
that are most similar to the query image, compute anomaly scores at multiple
levels, and fuse them into a final anomaly score. By unifying structural and
logical anomaly detection through collaborative memory banks, TMUAD achieves
state-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving
industrial and medical domains. The model and code are available at
https://github.com/SIA-IDE/TMUAD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频理解需要细粒度定位掩码和详细语义属性，但获取此类标注数据既繁琐又昂贵。

Method: 通过在现有大规模分割数据集（SAV）上使用伪物体描述进行标注，利用视觉语言模型预处理视频并生成描述，构建SAV-Caption数据集，并在该数据集与其他图像视频数据集上大规模训练VoCap模型。

Conclusion: VoCap模型通过创新的数据标注方法和多任务训练策略，有效解决了视频物体理解的多项任务，相关数据集将公开提供。

Abstract: Understanding objects in videos in terms of fine-grained localization masks
and detailed semantic properties is a fundamental task in video understanding.
In this paper, we propose VoCap, a flexible video model that consumes a video
and a prompt of various modalities (text, box or mask), and produces a
spatio-temporal masklet with a corresponding object-centric caption. As such
our model addresses simultaneously the tasks of promptable video object
segmentation, referring expression segmentation, and object captioning. Since
obtaining data for this task is tedious and expensive, we propose to annotate
an existing large-scale segmentation dataset (SAV) with pseudo object captions.
We do so by preprocessing videos with their ground-truth masks to highlight the
object of interest and feed this to a large Vision Language Model (VLM). For an
unbiased evaluation, we collect manual annotations on the validation set. We
call the resulting dataset SAV-Caption. We train our VoCap model at scale on a
SAV-Caption together with a mix of other image and video datasets. Our model
yields state-of-the-art results on referring expression video object
segmentation, is competitive on semi-supervised video object segmentation, and
establishes a benchmark for video object captioning. Our dataset will be made
available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/vocap.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将动词分类视为单标签问题，但视觉事件识别存在固有歧义性，同一图像可能被多个动词类别合理描述，需要重新审视这一问题的多标签本质。

Method: 将动词分类重新定义为单正例多标签学习问题，提出Graph Enhanced Verb MLP模型，结合图神经网络捕捉标签相关性和对抗训练优化决策边界。

Result: 在真实数据集上实验表明，该方法在MAP指标上获得超过3%的提升，同时在传统top-1和top-5准确率指标上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 动词分类本质上是多标签问题，提出的SPMLL框架和GE-VerbMLP模型有效解决了标注不完全的问题，为场景识别提供了更准确的动词分类方案。

Abstract: Context recognition (SR) is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims
to extract structured semantic summaries from images by identifying key events
and their associated entities. Specifically, given an input image, the model
must first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify
the participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling),
and finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization).
Existing methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we
show through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address
the inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories
may reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key
contributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb
classification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous
semantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of
fully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to
reformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning
(SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a
comprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully
designed to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To
address the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb
Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to
capture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision
boundaries. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach
achieves more than 3\% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on
traditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.

TL;DR: DriveQA是一个全面的开源文本和视觉基准测试，用于评估LLM和MLLM在驾驶知识测试中的表现，发现现有模型在数值推理、复杂路权场景等方面存在显著弱点，但通过在该数据集上微调可以显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动驾驶基准测试主要关注空间和视觉问答任务，但缺乏对完整交通规则、标志和路权原则的全面理解评估。人类驾驶员需要识别现实数据集中罕见的边缘案例，而当前模型在这方面存在不足。

Method: 开发了DriveQA基准测试，包含文本和视觉模态，全面覆盖交通规则和场景。通过实验评估最先进的LLM和MLLM模型，并进行微调实验和下游任务性能测试。

Result: 1) SOTA模型在基本交通规则上表现良好，但在数值推理、复杂路权场景、交通标志变体和空间布局方面存在显著弱点；2) 在DriveQA上微调可提高多个类别的准确性，特别是在监管标志识别和交叉口决策方面；3) DriveQA-V的环境变化分析揭示了模型对光照、视角、距离和天气条件的敏感性；4) 在DriveQA上预训练可提升下游驾驶任务性能，在nuScenes和BDD等真实数据集上取得更好结果。

Conclusion: DriveQA为评估和改进LLM/MLLM的驾驶知识理解提供了重要基准，证明了通过专门数据集训练可以显著提升模型在复杂交通场景中的表现和泛化能力。

Abstract: If a Large Language Model (LLM) were to take a driving knowledge test today,
would it pass? Beyond standard spatial and visual question-answering (QA) tasks
on current autonomous driving benchmarks, driving knowledge tests require a
complete understanding of all traffic rules, signage, and right-of-way
principles. To pass this test, human drivers must discern various edge cases
that rarely appear in real-world datasets. In this work, we present DriveQA, an
extensive open-source text and vision-based benchmark that exhaustively covers
traffic regulations and scenarios. Through our experiments using DriveQA, we
show that (1) state-of-the-art LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) perform well on
basic traffic rules but exhibit significant weaknesses in numerical reasoning
and complex right-of-way scenarios, traffic sign variations, and spatial
layouts, (2) fine-tuning on DriveQA improves accuracy across multiple
categories, particularly in regulatory sign recognition and intersection
decision-making, (3) controlled variations in DriveQA-V provide insights into
model sensitivity to environmental factors such as lighting, perspective,
distance, and weather conditions, and (4) pretraining on DriveQA enhances
downstream driving task performance, leading to improved results on real-world
datasets such as nuScenes and BDD, while also demonstrating that models can
internalize text and synthetic traffic knowledge to generalize effectively
across downstream QA tasks.

Motivation: 误导性可视化是社交媒体和网络上错误信息的重要来源，通过违反图表设计原则来扭曲数据。现有AI模型训练和评估缺乏大规模、多样化、公开可用的数据集。

Method: 构建Misviz真实数据集（2,604个标注图表）和Misviz-synth合成数据集（81,814个基于真实数据表的Matplotlib生成图表），使用最先进的MLLMs、基于规则系统和微调分类器进行全面评估。

Result: 任务仍然极具挑战性，当前模型在检测误导性可视化方面表现有限。

Conclusion: 发布了Misviz基准数据集、合成数据集和相关代码，为检测误导性可视化和减少错误信息传播提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Misleading visualizations are a potent driver of misinformation on social
media and the web. By violating chart design principles, they distort data and
lead readers to draw inaccurate conclusions. Prior work has shown that both
humans and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are frequently deceived by
such visualizations. Automatically detecting misleading visualizations and
identifying the specific design rules they violate could help protect readers
and reduce the spread of misinformation. However, the training and evaluation
of AI models has been limited by the absence of large, diverse, and openly
available datasets. In this work, we introduce Misviz, a benchmark of 2,604
real-world visualizations annotated with 12 types of misleaders. To support
model training, we also release Misviz-synth, a synthetic dataset of 81,814
visualizations generated using Matplotlib and based on real-world data tables.
We perform a comprehensive evaluation on both datasets using state-of-the-art
MLLMs, rule-based systems, and fine-tuned classifiers. Our results reveal that
the task remains highly challenging. We release Misviz, Misviz-synth, and the
accompanying code.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型容易学习训练数据中的伪相关性，利用这些非目标特征进行预测，导致性能下降和泛化能力差。需要一种方法同时处理多种偏见并增强分布外鲁棒性。

Method: CoBA框架在语义三元组级别操作：首先将文本分解为主谓宾三元组，然后选择性修改这些三元组以破坏伪相关性，最后从调整后的三元组重建文本来生成反偏见数据。

Result: 实验表明CoBA不仅提高了下游任务性能，还能有效减少偏见并增强分布外鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CoBA提供了一个通用且鲁棒的解决方案，能够有效应对伪相关性带来的挑战，具有很好的实用价值。

Abstract: Deep learning models often learn and exploit spurious correlations in
training data, using these non-target features to inform their predictions.
Such reliance leads to performance degradation and poor generalization on
unseen data. To address these limitations, we introduce a more general form of
counterfactual data augmentation, termed counterbias data augmentation, which
simultaneously tackles multiple biases (e.g., gender bias, simplicity bias) and
enhances out-of-distribution robustness. We present CoBA: CounterBias
Augmentation, a unified framework that operates at the semantic triple level:
first decomposing text into subject-predicate-object triples, then selectively
modifying these triples to disrupt spurious correlations. By reconstructing the
text from these adjusted triples, CoBA generates counterbias data that
mitigates spurious patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
CoBA not only improves downstream task performance, but also effectively
reduces biases and strengthens out-of-distribution resilience, offering a
versatile and robust solution to the challenges posed by spurious correlations.

Abstract: A lack of demographic context in existing toxic speech datasets limits our
understanding of how different age groups communicate online. In collaboration
with funk, a German public service content network, this research introduces
the first large-scale German dataset annotated for toxicity and enriched with
platform-provided age estimates. The dataset includes 3,024 human-annotated and
30,024 LLM-annotated anonymized comments from Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube.
To ensure relevance, comments were consolidated using predefined toxic
keywords, resulting in 16.7\% labeled as problematic. The annotation pipeline
combined human expertise with state-of-the-art language models, identifying key
categories such as insults, disinformation, and criticism of broadcasting fees.
The dataset reveals age-based differences in toxic speech patterns, with
younger users favoring expressive language and older users more often engaging
in disinformation and devaluation. This resource provides new opportunities for
studying linguistic variation across demographics and supports the development
of more equitable and age-aware content moderation systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose TrInk, a Transformer-based model for ink

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM在价格谈判中存在锚定效应，推理模型能减轻这种效应，但人格特质与锚定效应敏感性无显著相关


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在现实应用中的认知偏见，特别是锚定效应对价格谈判可靠性的影响

Method: 使用卖方LLM代理应用锚定效应，通过客观和主观指标评估谈判结果，分析推理和人格因素与锚定效应的关系

Result: LLM像人类一样受锚定效应影响，推理模型较不易受影响（长思维链减轻效应），但人格特质与锚定效应敏感性无显著相关性

Conclusion: 这些发现有助于深入理解LLM的认知偏见，促进LLM在社会中安全负责任的应用

Abstract: Cognitive biases, well-studied in humans, can also be observed in LLMs,
affecting their reliability in real-world applications. This paper investigates
the anchoring effect in LLM-driven price negotiations. To this end, we
instructed seller LLM agents to apply the anchoring effect and evaluated
negotiations using not only an objective metric but also a subjective metric.
Experimental results show that LLMs are influenced by the anchoring effect like
humans. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between the anchoring
effect and factors such as reasoning and personality. It was shown that
reasoning models are less prone to the anchoring effect, suggesting that the
long chain of thought mitigates the effect. However, we found no significant
correlation between personality traits and susceptibility to the anchoring
effect. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of cognitive biases
in LLMs and to the realization of safe and responsible application of LLMs in
society.

TL;DR: Percept-V数据集评估多模态大语言模型在基本视觉感知任务上的表现，发现模型性能随问题复杂度增加而显著下降


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前对多模态大语言模型在简单感知任务上的性能评估有限，需要测试它们在基本形状和结构生成的干净图像上的表现

Method: 创建包含7200张程序生成图像的Percept-V数据集，分为30个类别测试不同视觉感知技能，并在GPT-4o、Gemini、Claude等先进模型上进行测试

Result: 实验显示模型性能随问题复杂度增加而显著下降，所有类别都呈现相似趋势，某些认知技能比其他技能更难

Conclusion: 尽管MLLMs在复杂任务上表现出色，但在基本视觉感知任务上存在明显局限，需要进一步改进模型的底层感知能力

Abstract: The reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
garnered a lot of attention in recent times, with advances made in frontiers
like coding, mathematics, and science. However, very limited experiments have
been done to assess their performance in simple perception tasks performed over
uncontaminated, generated images containing basic shapes and structures. To
address this issue, the paper introduces a dataset, Percept-V, containing a
total of 7200 program-generated images equally divided into 30 categories, each
testing a combination of visual perception skills. Unlike previously proposed
datasets, Percept-V comprises very basic tasks of varying complexity that test
the perception abilities of MLLMs. This dataset is then tested on
state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude as well as Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 to gauge their
performance. Contrary to the evidence that MLLMs excel in many complex tasks,
our experiments show a significant drop in the models' performance with
increasing problem complexity across all categories. An analysis of the
performances also reveals that the tested MLLMs exhibit a similar trend in
accuracy across categories, testing a particular cognitive skill and find some
skills to be more difficult than others.

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) are transforming how knowledge is
represented, integrated, and applied in scientific research, yet their progress
is shaped by the complex nature of scientific data. This survey presents a
comprehensive, data-centric synthesis that reframes the development of Sci-LLMs
as a co-evolution between models and their underlying data substrate. We
formulate a unified taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of
scientific knowledge, emphasizing the multimodal, cross-scale, and
domain-specific challenges that differentiate scientific corpora from general
natural language processing datasets. We systematically review recent Sci-LLMs,
from general-purpose foundations to specialized models across diverse
scientific disciplines, alongside an extensive analysis of over 270
pre-/post-training datasets, showing why Sci-LLMs pose distinct demands --
heterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora that require
representations preserving domain invariance and enabling cross-modal
reasoning. On evaluation, we examine over 190 benchmark datasets and trace a
shift from static exams toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with
advanced evaluation protocols. These data-centric analyses highlight persistent
issues in scientific data development and discuss emerging solutions involving
semi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. Finally, we outline
a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous agents based on
Sci-LLMs actively experiment, validate, and contribute to a living, evolving
knowledge base. Collectively, this work provides a roadmap for building
trustworthy, continually evolving artificial intelligence (AI) systems that
function as a true partner in accelerating scientific discovery.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM评估存在显著标签偏见：Claude标签总是提高评分，Gemini标签总是降低评分，错误标签可导致排名完全反转，评分差异高达50个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型越来越多地被用于评估输出，需要研究其判断是否受到模型标签偏见的影响，以确保评估的公平性。

Method: 使用ChatGPT、Gemini和Claude三种模型，在无标签、真实标签和两种错误标签条件下，通过整体偏好投票和三个质量维度（连贯性、信息性、简洁性）的百分比评分进行自评估和交叉评估。

Result: 发现明显的评估偏见：Claude标签始终提升分数，Gemini标签始终降低分数；错误标签经常导致排名反转，偏好投票差异达50%，质量评分差异达12%；Gemini在真实标签下自评分崩溃，Claude自偏好增强。

Conclusion: 模型身份认知会严重扭曲高级判断并微妙影响详细质量评分，强调需要盲评或多模型评估协议来确保LLM基准测试的公平性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate outputs, yet
their judgments may be influenced. This study examines bias in self- and
cross-model evaluations by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude under four conditions:
no labels, true labels, and two false-label scenarios. Blog posts authored by
each model were evaluated by all three using both overall preference voting and
quality ratings for Coherence, Informativeness, and Conciseness, with all
scores expressed as percentages for direct comparison. Results reveal striking
asymmetries: the "Claude" label consistently boosts scores, while the "Gemini"
label consistently depresses them, regardless of actual content. False labels
frequently reversed rankings, producing shifts of up to 50 percentage points in
preference votes and up to 12 percentage points in converted quality ratings.
Gemini's self-scores collapsed under true labels, while Claude's
self-preference intensified. These findings show that perceived model identity
can heavily distort high-level judgments and subtly influence detailed quality
ratings, underscoring the need for blind or multimodel evaluation protocols to
ensure fairness in LLM benchmarking.

Motivation: 提升大语言模型作为多轮对话代理的能力，使其能够智能地、自适应地从用户或其他外部来源收集信息

Method: 基于序列贝叶斯实验设计框架，迭代选择能最大化期望信息增益的问题，使用基于LLM信念分布的概率模型，并设计了专门的EIG估计器和候选查询策略

Result: 在20个问题游戏和用户偏好推断测试中，BED-LLM相比直接提示和其他自适应设计策略取得了显著的性能提升

Conclusion: BED-LLM为LLMs提供了一个原则性的框架，使其能够作为有效的多轮对话代理与外部环境交互，通过智能信息收集显著提升任务性能

Abstract: We propose a general-purpose approach for improving the ability of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently and adaptively gather information from
a user or other external source using the framework of sequential Bayesian
experimental design (BED). This enables LLMs to act as effective multi-turn
conversational agents and interactively interface with external environments.
Our approach, which we call BED-LLM (Bayesian Experimental Design with Large
Language Models), is based on iteratively choosing questions or queries that
maximize the expected information gain (EIG) about the task of interest given
the responses gathered previously. We show how this EIG can be formulated in a
principled way using a probabilistic model derived from the LLM's belief
distribution and provide detailed insights into key decisions in its
construction. Further key to the success of BED-LLM are a number of specific
innovations, such as a carefully designed estimator for the EIG, not solely
relying on in-context updates for conditioning on previous responses, and a
targeted strategy for proposing candidate queries. We find that BED-LLM
achieves substantial gains in performance across a wide range of tests based on
the 20-questions game and using the LLM to actively infer user preferences,
compared to direct prompting of the LLM and other adaptive design strategies.

Motivation: 传统航空事故人因分析方法(HFACS)存在可扩展性和一致性限制，需要自动化解决方案来提升分析效率和准确性

Method: 使用强化学习GRPO对Llama-3.1 8B模型进行微调，结合多组件奖励系统和合成数据生成技术处理类别不平衡问题

Result: 精确匹配准确率提升350%(0.04→0.18)，部分匹配准确率达0.88，超越GPT-5-mini和Gemini-2.5-fiash等先进模型

Conclusion: 验证了小型领域优化模型在关键安全分析中的计算效率和性能优势，为资源受限边缘设备部署提供了可行方案

Abstract: Analyzing the human factors behind aviation accidents is crucial for
preventing future incidents, yet traditional methods using the Human Factors
Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) are limited by scalability and
consistency. To address this, we introduce an automated HFACS classification
framework for aviation safety analysis that utilizes Reinforcement Learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune a Llama-3.1 8B
language model. Our approach incorporates a multi-component reward system
tailored for aviation safety analysis and integrates synthetic data generation
to overcome class imbalance in accident datasets. The resulting GRPO-optimized
model achieved noticeable performance gains, including a 350% increase in exact
match accuracy (from 0.0400 to 0.1800) and an improved partial match accuracy
of 0.8800. Significantly, our specialized model outperforms state-of-the-art
LLMs (Large Language Models), including GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-fiash, on key
metrics. This research also proposes exact match accuracy in multi-label HFACS
classification problem as a new benchmarking methodology to evaluate the
advanced reasoning capabilities of language models. Ultimately, our work
validates that smaller, domain-optimized models can provide a computationally
efficient and better solution for critical safety analysis. This approach makes
powerful, low-latency deployment on resource-constrained edge devices feasible.

TL;DR: 提出基于像素的生成语言模型，通过将单词渲染为图像来替代基于文本的嵌入，解决了自回归语言模型对多语言字符攻击的脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型容易受到多语言字符拼写攻击，导致性能显著下降，这主要源于子词分词器及其嵌入的词汇表外问题。

Method: 使用基于像素的表示方法，将单词渲染为单个图像，替代传统的基于文本的嵌入方式。

Result: 在多语言LAMBADA数据集、WMT24数据集和SST-2基准测试中验证了该方法对拼写噪声的鲁棒性和在多语言环境中的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于像素的生成语言模型设计提供了对噪声输入更强的鲁棒性，并扩展了对不同书写系统多语言文本的兼容性。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are vulnerable to orthographic attacks, where
input text is perturbed with characters from multilingual alphabets, leading to
substantial performance degradation. This vulnerability primarily stems from
the out-of-vocabulary issue inherent in subword tokenizers and their
embeddings. To address this limitation, we propose a pixel-based generative
language model that replaces the text-based embeddings with pixel-based
representations by rendering words as individual images. This design provides
stronger robustness to noisy inputs, while an extension of compatibility to
multilingual text across diverse writing systems. We evaluate the proposed
method on the multilingual LAMBADA dataset, WMT24 dataset and the SST-2
benchmark, demonstrating both its resilience to orthographic noise and its
effectiveness in multilingual settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自监督语音模型中是否存在人类语言习得的关键期效应，即第二语言学习难度随接触时间延迟而增加，以及第一语言保持能力随接触时间延长而增强的现象

Method: 训练不同L2训练开始时间和L1训练结束时间的自监督语音模型，使用儿童导向语音数据，评估其音素辨别性能

Result: 自监督语音模型未显示出明显的语音习得关键期效应。延迟L2接触开始的模型在L2上表现更好，延迟L1接触结束会导致L1遗忘

Conclusion: 自监督语音模型在语音习得方面不遵循人类的关键期效应模式，这表明当前模型的语言习得机制与人类存在差异

Abstract: This paper investigates whether the Critical Period (CP) effects in human
language acquisition are observed in self-supervised speech models (S3Ms). CP
effects refer to greater difficulty in acquiring a second language (L2) with
delayed L2 exposure onset, and greater retention of their first language (L1)
with delayed L1 exposure offset. While previous work has studied these effects
using textual language models, their presence in speech models remains
underexplored despite the central role of spoken language in human language
acquisition. We train S3Ms with varying L2 training onsets and L1 training
offsets on child-directed speech and evaluate their phone discrimination
performance. We find that S3Ms do not exhibit clear evidence of either CP
effects in terms of phonological acquisition. Notably, models with delayed L2
exposure onset tend to perform better on L2 and delayed L1 exposure offset
leads to L1 forgetting.

Result: 实验显示方法实现最高3倍加速，且不牺牲AUROC性能

Conclusion: DMP能持续提升多响应生成效率，有望扩展到对齐和推理任务，与模型、数据集、解码策略和自一致性基线正交

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in both
research and real-world applications, but they still struggle with
hallucination. Existing hallucination detection methods often perform poorly on
sentence-level generation or rely heavily on domain-specific knowledge. While
self-consistency approaches help address these limitations, they incur high
computational costs due to repeated generation. In this paper, we conduct the
first study on identifying redundancy in self-consistency methods, manifested
as shared prefix tokens across generations, and observe that non-exact-answer
tokens contribute minimally to the semantic content. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel Decoding Memory Pipeline (DMP) that accelerates generation
through selective inference and annealed decoding. Being orthogonal to the
model, dataset, decoding strategy, and self-consistency baseline, our DMP
consistently improves the efficiency of multi-response generation and holds
promise for extension to alignment and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments
show that our method achieves up to a 3x speedup without sacrificing AUROC
performance.

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过统计学上的"正态性"概念重新解读图灵测试，认为图灵测试是测试平几智力而非优秀智力，并需要通过多个判官的统计平均来判断，因此像ChatGPT这样的大语言模型很难通过真正的图灵测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新考虑图灵测试的理论基础，探讨统计学中的"正态性"概念如何帮助理解图灵测试的本质要求，以及当代AI模型为什么可能无法通过真正的图灵测试。

Method: 使用统计学和规范性理论的概念对图灵测试进行重新分析，将"平均人类询问者"解释为多个判官判断的统计归一化结果，而非单个非专业判官。

Result: 得出两个主要结论：1）大语言模型如ChatGPT目标是优秀智力而非平均智力，因此无法通过真正的图灵测试；2）图灵测试能否有助于理解人类认知取决于人类智力是否可以约化为平均智力。

Conclusion: 图灵测试实质上是一种对"正态智力"的测试，需要机器像普通人类一样出错和不完美行为。当代AI模型趋向于建模人类优秀智力，因此构成了"人工智慧"而非真正的人工智能。

Abstract: This paper proposes to revisit the Turing test through the concept of
normality. Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the
normal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense
of the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two
ways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather
than exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test
requires building machines that "make mistakes" and display imperfect behavior
just like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a
statistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a
single "average" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As
such, the notion of "average human interrogator" that Turing talks about in his
original paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical
abstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of
multiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of
normal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average
judgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,
it argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the
Turing test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than
normal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it
proposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per
se. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can
contribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether
the human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which
largely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual
underpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to.

Motivation: 研究自动文本摘要评估中的可复现性问题，因为现有文献中报告的评估指标性能与实际实验结果存在不一致，需要建立公平透明的比较框架。

Method: 构建统一的开源评估框架，在SummEval数据集上测试六种代表性指标（从经典ROUGE到最新LLM方法如G-Eval、SEval-Ex），进行系统性实验分析。

Result: 发现评估指标存在结构性权衡：与人类判断对齐度最高的指标往往计算密集且运行稳定性较差；LLM评估方法存在随机性、技术依赖性和有限可复现性等问题。

Conclusion: 呼吁建立更稳健的评估协议，包括详尽文档记录和方法标准化，以确保自动摘要评估的更高可靠性。

Abstract: This paper investigates reproducibility challenges in automatic text
summarization evaluation. Based on experiments conducted across six
representative metrics ranging from classical approaches like ROUGE to recent
LLM-based methods (G-Eval, SEval-Ex), we highlight significant discrepancies
between reported performances in the literature and those observed in our
experimental setting. We introduce a unified, open-source framework, applied to
the SummEval dataset and designed to support fair and transparent comparison of
evaluation metrics. Our results reveal a structural trade-off: metrics with the
highest alignment with human judgments tend to be computationally intensive and
less stable across runs. Beyond comparative analysis, this study highlights key
concerns about relying on LLMs for evaluation, stressing their randomness,
technical dependencies, and limited reproducibility. We advocate for more
robust evaluation protocols including exhaustive documentation and
methodological standardization to ensure greater reliability in automatic

### [79] [Automatic Reviewers Fail to Detect Faulty Reasoning in Research Papers: A New Counterfactual Evaluation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21422)
*Nils Dycke,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs作为自动审稿生成器在检测研究逻辑缺陷方面表现不佳，即使论文存在明显逻辑错误，生成的审稿意见也没有显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs越来越多地被用作全自动审稿生成器，需要了解其在检测研究逻辑缺陷这一核心审稿技能上的具体能力和局限性，以避免对科学完整性造成风险。

Method: 提出了一个完全自动化的反事实评估框架，在受控条件下隔离和测试LLMs检测研究逻辑缺陷的能力，测试了多种ARG方法。

Result: 与预期相反，研究发现研究逻辑中的缺陷对LLMs生成的审稿输出没有显著影响，表明当前ARG方法在检测逻辑一致性方面存在严重局限。

Conclusion: 基于研究发现提出了三项可操作的建议，并公开了反事实数据集和评估框架，为未来研究提供基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have great potential to accelerate and support
scholarly peer review and are increasingly used as fully automatic review
generators (ARGs). However, potential biases and systematic errors may pose
significant risks to scientific integrity; understanding the specific
capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art ARGs is essential. We focus on
a core reviewing skill that underpins high-quality peer review: detecting
faulty research logic. This involves evaluating the internal consistency
between a paper's results, interpretations, and claims. We present a fully
automated counterfactual evaluation framework that isolates and tests this
skill under controlled conditions. Testing a range of ARG approaches, we find
that, contrary to expectation, flaws in research logic have no significant
effect on their output reviews. Based on our findings, we derive three
actionable recommendations for future work and release our counterfactual
dataset and evaluation framework publicly.

*Meidan Ding,Jipeng Zhang,Wenxuan Wang,Cheng-Yi Li,Wei-Chieh Fang,Hsin-Yu Wu,Haiqin Zhong,Wenting Chen,Linlin Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个专门评估医学奖励模型和评判器的基准Med-RewardBench，包含1026个专家标注的多模态医疗案例，覆盖13个器官系统和8个临床科室，在6个关键临床维度上评估32个先进MLLM模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注通用MLLM能力或作为求解器评估，缺乏对医疗诊断准确性和临床相关性等关键维度的专门评估，医学奖励模型和评判器研究不足。

Method: 构建包含1026个专家标注案例的多模态数据集，采用严格的三步流程确保高质量评估数据，涵盖6个临床关键维度，评估32个先进MLLM模型并开发基线模型。

Result: 评估显示现有模型在输出与专家判断对齐方面存在重大挑战，开发的基线模型通过微调实现了显著性能提升。

Conclusion: Med-RewardBench填补了医学奖励模型评估的空白，为医疗AI系统的可靠评估提供了重要基准，证明了专门医疗模型优化的必要性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold significant potential in
medical applications, including disease diagnosis and clinical decision-making.
However, these tasks require highly accurate, context-sensitive, and
professionally aligned responses, making reliable reward models and judges
critical. Despite their importance, medical reward models (MRMs) and judges
remain underexplored, with no dedicated benchmarks addressing clinical
requirements. Existing benchmarks focus on general MLLM capabilities or
evaluate models as solvers, neglecting essential evaluation dimensions like
diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. To address this, we introduce
Med-RewardBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MRMs and
judges in medical scenarios. Med-RewardBench features a multimodal dataset
spanning 13 organ systems and 8 clinical departments, with 1,026
expert-annotated cases. A rigorous three-step process ensures high-quality
evaluation data across six clinically critical dimensions. We evaluate 32
state-of-the-art MLLMs, including open-source, proprietary, and
medical-specific models, revealing substantial challenges in aligning outputs
with expert judgment. Additionally, we develop baseline models that demonstrate
substantial performance improvements through fine-tuning.

*Yunhao Zhang,Shaonan Wang,Nan Lin,Xinyi Dong,Chong Li,Chengqing Zong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个解耦连续语义表示模型(DCSRM)，将大语言模型中的词嵌入分解为多个子嵌入，每个子嵌入编码特定的语义信息，从而识别出可解释的语义子维度，并通过脑成像验证其神经合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义维度分析方法通常依赖预定义的粗粒度语义维度，忽略了更精细的概念区分。需要开发新方法来揭示粗粒度语义维度下的子维度结构。

Method: 提出DCSRM模型，将词嵌入分解为多个子嵌入；使用体素编码模型将这些子维度映射到大脑激活模式；通过极性等原则分析语义维度结构。

Result: 成功识别出一组可解释的语义子维度；发现极性是驱动语义维度分解为子维度的关键因素；神经相关性分析支持了这些子维度的认知和神经科学合理性。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了更细粒度的可解释语义子维度，揭示了语义维度按照不同原则组织的特性，为理解语言和大脑中意义的组织方式提供了新见解。

Abstract: Understanding the core dimensions of conceptual semantics is fundamental to
uncovering how meaning is organized in language and the brain. Existing
approaches often rely on predefined semantic dimensions that offer only broad
representations, overlooking finer conceptual distinctions. This paper proposes
a novel framework to investigate the subdimensions underlying coarse-grained
semantic dimensions. Specifically, we introduce a Disentangled Continuous
Semantic Representation Model (DCSRM) that decomposes word embeddings from
large language models into multiple sub-embeddings, each encoding specific
semantic information. Using these sub-embeddings, we identify a set of
interpretable semantic subdimensions. To assess their neural plausibility, we
apply voxel-wise encoding models to map these subdimensions to brain
activation. Our work offers more fine-grained interpretable semantic
subdimensions of conceptual meaning. Further analyses reveal that semantic
dimensions are structured according to distinct principles, with polarity
emerging as a key factor driving their decomposition into subdimensions. The
neural correlates of the identified subdimensions support their cognitive and
neuroscientific plausibility.

### [82] [Beyond the Surface: Probing the Ideological Depth of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21448)
*Shariar Kabir,Kevin Esterling,Yue Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出"意识形态深度"概念来衡量LLM内部政治表征的稳健性和复杂性，通过可操纵性测试和稀疏自编码器分析发现不同模型具有显著差异的意识形态特征分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型表现出明显的意识形态倾向，但这些倾向的稳定性和深度尚不清楚。表面响应容易被提示工程操纵，需要探究其是否反映连贯的底层意识形态。

Method: 采用双重方法：1) 通过指令提示和激活引导测量开源LLM的可操纵性；2) 使用稀疏自编码器(SAEs)探测模型内部机制，分析意识形态特征。

Result: 发现可操纵性较低的模型具有更独特和抽象的意识形态特征，一个模型可比同规模模型多7.3倍政治特征。对核心政治特征进行靶向消融能在"深度"模型中产生一致逻辑推理转变，而在"浅层"模型中仅增加拒绝输出。

Conclusion: 意识形态深度是LLM的可量化属性，可操纵性为研究其潜在政治架构提供了重要窗口。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated pronounced ideological
leanings, yet the stability and depth of these positions remain poorly
understood. Surface-level responses can often be manipulated through simple
prompt engineering, calling into question whether they reflect a coherent
underlying ideology. This paper investigates the concept of "ideological depth"
in LLMs, defined as the robustness and complexity of their internal political
representations. We employ a dual approach: first, we measure the
"steerability" of two well-known open-source LLMs using instruction prompting
and activation steering. We find that while some models can easily switch
between liberal and conservative viewpoints, others exhibit resistance or an
increased rate of refusal, suggesting a more entrenched ideological structure.
Second, we probe the internal mechanisms of these models using Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs). Preliminary analysis reveals that models with lower
steerability possess more distinct and abstract ideological features. Our
evaluations reveal that one model can contain 7.3x more political features than
another model of similar size. This allows targeted ablation of a core
political feature in an ideologically "deep" model, leading to consistent,
logical shifts in its reasoning across related topics, whereas the same
intervention in a "shallow" model results in an increase in refusal outputs.
Our findings suggest that ideological depth is a quantifiable property of LLMs
and that steerability serves as a valuable window into their latent political
architecture.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出两种AI驱动的奖励策略，通过RLAIF框架提升7B参数小语言模型的中文创意写作能力，其中基于原则的LLM-as-a-Judge方法表现最佳


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型计算需求高，小语言模型通过监督微调缺乏新颖性，RLHF成本高昂，需要寻找更高效的创意写作提升方法

Method: 使用RLAIF框架，探索两种奖励策略：1) 基于多智能体拒绝采样框架训练的奖励模型；2) 采用对抗训练和反思机制优化的原则引导LLM-as-a-Judge方法

Result: 两种方法均显著超越基线，但原则引导的LLM-as-a-Judge方法在生成质量、训练效率和减少人工标注依赖方面表现更优，自动评估与人工判断高度一致

Conclusion: 原则引导的LLM-as-a-Judge方法为创意小语言模型提供了更可扩展和有效的路径，自动化评估方法可靠

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable creative writing
capabilities, yet their substantial computational demands hinder widespread
use. Enhancing Small Language Models (SLMs) offers a promising alternative, but
current methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) struggle with novelty, and
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is costly. This paper
explores two distinct AI-driven reward strategies within a Reinforcement
Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to ignite the creative writing of a
7B-parameter SLM, specifically for generating Chinese greetings. The first
strategy employs a RM trained on high-quality preference data curated by a
novel multi-agent rejection sampling framework designed for creative tasks. The
second, more novel strategy utilizes a principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge, whose
reward function is optimized via an adversarial training scheme with a
reflection mechanism, to directly provide reward signals. Comprehensive
experiments reveal that while both approaches significantly enhance creative
output over baselines, the principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge demonstrably yields
superior generation quality. Furthermore, it offers notable advantages in
training efficiency and reduced dependency on human-annotated data, presenting
a more scalable and effective path towards creative SLMs. Our automated
evaluation methods also exhibit strong alignment with human judgments. Our code

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的自动分类器选择方法HierarchySelect，通过层次聚类和多样性优先策略来构建更有效的集成学习系统，用于假新闻检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的集成学习方法在假新闻检测中性能严重依赖于分类器的多样性，但选择真正多样化的模型仍然是一个关键挑战，因为模型往往学习冗余模式。

Method: 首先计算分类器间的成对多样性，应用层次聚类将其组织成不同粒度的组。然后HierarchySelect探索这些层次级别，为每个级别选择一个分类器池，每个池代表不同的内部多样性。最后选择最多样化的池用于集成构建，并融入性能评估指标以确保泛化能力。

Result: 在6个不同应用领域数据集上的实验表明，该方法在其中2个数据集上达到了最高准确率，优于Elbow启发式方法和最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的HierarchySelect方法能够有效选择多样化的分类器，提升集成学习系统在假新闻检测任务中的性能，为解决模型冗余问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Psychological biases, such as confirmation bias, make individuals
particularly vulnerable to believing and spreading fake news on social media,
leading to significant consequences in domains such as public health and
politics. Machine learning-based fact-checking systems have been widely studied
to mitigate this problem. Among them, ensemble methods are particularly
effective in combining multiple classifiers to improve robustness. However,
their performance heavily depends on the diversity of the constituent
classifiers-selecting genuinely diverse models remains a key challenge,
especially when models tend to learn redundant patterns. In this work, we
propose a novel automatic classifier selection approach that prioritizes
diversity, also extended by performance. The method first computes pairwise
diversity between classifiers and applies hierarchical clustering to organize
them into groups at different levels of granularity. A HierarchySelect then
explores these hierarchical levels to select one pool of classifiers per level,
each representing a distinct intra-pool diversity. The most diverse pool is
identified and selected for ensemble construction from these. The selection
process incorporates an evaluation metric reflecting each classifiers's
performance to ensure the ensemble also generalises well. We conduct
experiments with 40 heterogeneous classifiers across six datasets from
different application domains and with varying numbers of classes. Our method
is compared against the Elbow heuristic and state-of-the-art baselines. Results
show that our approach achieves the highest accuracy on two of six datasets.

Abstract: We present MahaSTS, a human-annotated Sentence Textual Similarity (STS)
dataset for Marathi, along with MahaSBERT-STS-v2, a fine-tuned Sentence-BERT
model optimized for regression-based similarity scoring. The MahaSTS dataset
consists of 16,860 Marathi sentence pairs labeled with continuous similarity
scores in the range of 0-5. To ensure balanced supervision, the dataset is
uniformly distributed across six score-based buckets spanning the full 0-5
range, thus reducing label bias and enhancing model stability. We fine-tune the
MahaSBERT model on this dataset and benchmark its performance against other
alternatives like MahaBERT, MuRIL, IndicBERT, and IndicSBERT. Our experiments
demonstrate that MahaSTS enables effective training for sentence similarity

Abstract: The proliferation of textual data containing sensitive personal information
across various domains requires robust anonymization techniques to protect
privacy and comply with regulations, while preserving data usability for
diverse and crucial downstream tasks. This survey provides a comprehensive
overview of current trends and recent advances in text anonymization
techniques. We begin by discussing foundational approaches, primarily centered
on Named Entity Recognition, before examining the transformative impact of
Large Language Models, detailing their dual role as sophisticated anonymizers

specialized subfield of authorship anonymization. Additionally, we review
evaluation frameworks, comprehensive metrics, benchmarks, and practical
toolkits for real-world deployment of anonymization solutions. This review
consolidates current knowledge, identifies emerging trends and persistent
challenges, including the evolving privacy-utility trade-off, the need to
address quasi-identifiers, and the implications of LLM capabilities, and aims

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择和合成方法存在静态数据集构建的局限性，无法适应模型能力的动态演化，需要建立闭环优化系统

Method: 三轴模型信号诊断（损失模式、嵌入聚类动态、自对齐分数）+自适应优化引擎+动态学习原则的闭环系统

Result: 在多个基准测试中平均提升7.15%的准确率，同时保持原始数据集规模

Conclusion: 建立了通过数据和模型动态人机协同演化的可持续LLM训练新范式

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Large Language Models (LLM) fundamentally rely
on high-quality training data. While data selection and data synthesis are two
common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face
limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model
capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed
dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and
context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off
filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop
optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively
identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns
(complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores
(quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal
samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic
integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model
capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our \method consistently enhances the quality of
seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on
average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a
new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution
of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are coming soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型越来越多地融入多轮协作的日常工作流程，需要了解不同性格特质的用户是否会对特定LLM产生系统性偏好。

Method: 对32名参与者（均匀分布在4种Keirsey性格类型）进行研究，评估他们与GPT-4和Claude 3.5在数据分析、创意写作、信息检索和写作协助四个协作任务中的互动。

Result: 理性型用户强烈偏好GPT-4（特别是目标导向任务），理想型用户偏好Claude 3.5（特别是创意和分析任务），其他性格类型偏好因任务而异。定性反馈的情感分析证实了这些模式。

Conclusion: 人格分析揭示了传统评估方法无法发现的LLM差异，尽管总体帮助性评分相似，但性格驱动的偏好差异显著。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into everyday
workflows, where users shape outcomes through multi-turn collaboration, a
critical question emerges: do users with different personality traits
systematically prefer certain LLMs over others? We conducted a study with 32
participants evenly distributed across four Keirsey personality types,
evaluating their interactions with GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 across four
collaborative tasks: data analysis, creative writing, information retrieval,
and writing assistance. Results revealed significant personality-driven
preferences: Rationals strongly preferred GPT-4, particularly for goal-oriented
tasks, while idealists favored Claude 3.5, especially for creative and
analytical tasks. Other personality types showed task-dependent preferences.
Sentiment analysis of qualitative feedback confirmed these patterns. Notably,
aggregate helpfulness ratings were similar across models, showing how
personality-based analysis reveals LLM differences that traditional evaluations
miss.

framework comprising specialized data transformation and training strategies.
The data transformation scheme enables the incorporation of more diverse
textual training datasets, while the task-specific training strategies enhance

LLM API, incorporating techniques such as paraphrasing, augmentation, and hard
negative example generation to improve the semantic richness and sample
difficulty of the training set. Additionally, we employ a two-stage training
strategy, comprising initial retrieval-focused pretraining followed by
full-task fine-tuning, enabling the embedding model to extend its capabilities
based on robust retrieval performance. Our model achieves state-of-the-art
results on the MTEB and CMTEB benchmarks, ranking first on both leaderboards
(August 27 2025), and simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art performance on
tasks including reranking, clustering, etc. Our findings demonstrate that
higher-quality, more diverse data is crucial for advancing retrieval model

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督微调在多任务场景下存在跷跷板现象，某些任务性能提升以其他任务性能下降为代价，需要解决任务干扰和遗忘问题

Method: 1) 独立微调识别核心参数区域；2) 基于区域重叠的任务聚类；3) 核心参数移植+非核心参数SLERP融合；4) 轻量级流水线SFT训练，冻结先前任务核心区域

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中显著缓解任务干扰和遗忘，持续优于传统多任务和多阶段微调基线

Conclusion: CPI-FT框架通过参数隔离和智能融合有效解决了多任务微调中的关键挑战，为LLM适配下游任务提供了新思路

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a pivotal approach to adapting large language
models (LLMs) for downstream tasks; however, performance often suffers from the
``seesaw phenomenon'', where indiscriminate parameter updates yield progress on
certain tasks at the expense of others. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel \emph{Core Parameter Isolation Fine-Tuning} (CPI-FT) framework.
Specifically, we first independently fine-tune the LLM on each task to identify
its core parameter regions by quantifying parameter update magnitudes. Tasks
with similar core regions are then grouped based on region overlap, forming
clusters for joint modeling. We further introduce a parameter fusion technique:
for each task, core parameters from its individually fine-tuned model are
directly transplanted into a unified backbone, while non-core parameters from
different tasks are smoothly integrated via Spherical Linear Interpolation
(SLERP), mitigating destructive interference. A lightweight, pipelined SFT
training phase using mixed-task data is subsequently employed, while freezing
core regions from prior tasks to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Extensive
experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
significantly alleviates task interference and forgetting, consistently
outperforming vanilla multi-task and multi-stage fine-tuning baselines.

Motivation: 当前AI研究越来越多地将大语言模型应用于推理密集型回归任务，这类任务需要从文本中推导细微的数值属性，但传统的提示方法和微调方法在此类任务上表现不佳。

Method: 提出MENTAT方法，结合批量反射提示优化和神经集成学习，在有限的特定任务训练数据和计算资源下优化模型性能。

Result: MENTAT方法相比基线方法取得了高达65%的性能提升，在三个实际问题上建立了初步基准。

Conclusion: 虽然MENTAT在推理密集型回归任务上取得了显著改进，但该领域仍有很大的发展空间，需要未来的进一步研究。

Abstract: AI researchers and practitioners increasingly apply large language models
(LLMs) to what we call reasoning-intensive regression (RiR), i.e. deducing
subtle numerical properties from text. Unlike standard language regression
tasks, e.g. for sentiment or similarity, RiR often appears instead in ad-hoc
problems like rubric-based scoring or domain-specific retrieval, where much
deeper analysis of text is required while only limited task-specific training
data and computation are available. We cast three realistic problems as RiR
tasks to establish an initial benchmark, and use that to test our hypothesis
that prompting frozen LLMs and finetuning Transformer encoders via gradient
descent will both often struggle in RiR. We then propose MENTAT, a simple and
lightweight method that combines batch-reflective prompt optimization with
neural ensemble learning. MENTAT achieves up to 65% improvement over both
baselines, though substantial room remains for future advances in RiR.

Conclusion: 正确推理链展现出显著更高的推理和答案置信度，证明了PiCSAR方法的有效性

Abstract: Best-of-n sampling improves the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) and
large reasoning models (LRMs) by generating multiple candidate solutions and
selecting the one with the highest reward. The key challenge for reasoning
tasks is designing a scoring function that can identify correct reasoning
chains without access to ground-truth answers. We propose Probabilistic
Confidence Selection And Ranking (PiCSAR): a simple, training-free method that
scores each candidate generation using the joint log-likelihood of the
reasoning and final answer. The joint log-likelihood of the reasoning and final
answer naturally decomposes into reasoning confidence and answer confidence.
PiCSAR achieves substantial gains across diverse benchmarks (+10.18 on MATH500,
+9.81 on AIME2025), outperforming baselines with at least 2x fewer samples in
16 out of 20 comparisons. Our analysis reveals that correct reasoning chains
exhibit significantly higher reasoning and answer confidence, justifying the
effectiveness of PiCSAR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络爬取数据质量参差不齐，存在安全性和伦理问题，但之前的研究受计算限制只能分析小样本，需要更好的工具来分析大规模训练数据

Method: 构建基于ElasticSearch的索引分析流水线，应用于1.5TB的多语言FineWeb-2语料库

Result: 实现了快速查询性能（大多数搜索在毫秒级内完成，所有查询都在2秒内完成），能够进行实时数据集分析

Conclusion: 该框架为构建更安全、更负责任的AI系统提供了实用工具，能够有效分析大规模语言模型训练数据的质量和安全性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely heavily on web-scale datasets like Common
Crawl, which provides over 80\% of training data for some modern models.
However, the indiscriminate nature of web crawling raises challenges in data
quality, safety, and ethics. Despite the critical importance of training data
quality, prior research on harmful content has been limited to small samples
due to computational constraints. This project presents a framework for
indexing and analyzing LLM training datasets using an ElasticSearch-based
pipeline. We apply it to SwissAI's FineWeb-2 corpus (1.5TB, four languages),
achieving fast query performance--most searches in milliseconds, all under 2
seconds. Our work demonstrates real-time dataset analysis, offering practical
tools for safer, more accountable AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型架构中的归纳偏置如何影响其在教学对话中的认知表现，特别是如何通过架构设计来塑造模型的教学策略

Method: 引入符号支架机制和短期记忆模式，通过五个系统变体的对照消融实验，使用专家设计的评分标准评估模型输出，采用基于LLM的评估框架进行可扩展的系统比较

Result: 完整系统在所有基线变体中表现最优，移除记忆或符号结构会显著降低关键认知行为（抽象、适应性探询、概念连续性）的表现

Conclusion: 架构支架能够可靠地塑造大语言模型中涌现的教学策略，支持处理层面的解释，表明架构设计对模型认知行为具有重要影响

Abstract: We study how architectural inductive biases influence the cognitive behavior
of large language models (LLMs) in instructional dialogue. We introduce a
symbolic scaffolding mechanism paired with a short-term memory schema designed
to promote adaptive, structured reasoning in Socratic tutoring. Using
controlled ablation across five system variants, we evaluate model outputs via
expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic
reasoning, and conversational memory. We present preliminary results using an
LLM-based evaluation framework aligned to a cognitively grounded rubric. This
enables scalable, systematic comparisons across architectural variants in
early-stage experimentation. The preliminary results show that our full system
consistently outperforms baseline variants. Analysis reveals that removing
memory or symbolic structure degrades key cognitive behaviors, including
abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity. These findings
support a processing-level account in which architectural scaffolds can
reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in LLMs.

Conclusion: GraphRAG在生物医学领域具有显著应用潜力，研究提供了易用接口和预建数据库供研究者测试标准RAG与GraphRAG性能。

Abstract: In the past two years, large language model (LLM)-based chatbots, such as
ChatGPT, have revolutionized various domains by enabling diverse task
completion and question-answering capabilities. However, their application in
scientific research remains constrained by challenges such as hallucinations,
limited domain-specific knowledge, and lack of explainability or traceability
for the response. Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has
emerged as a promising approach to improving chatbot reliability by integrating
domain-specific contextual information before response generation, addressing
some limitations of standard LLMs. Despite its potential, there are only
limited studies that evaluate GraphRAG on specific domains that require
intensive knowledge, like Alzheimer's disease or other biomedical domains. In
this paper, we assess the quality and traceability of two popular GraphRAG
systems. We compile a database of 50 papers and 70 expert questions related to
Alzheimer's disease, construct a GraphRAG knowledge base, and employ GPT-4o as
the LLM for answering queries. We then compare the quality of responses
generated by GraphRAG with those from a standard GPT-4o model. Additionally, we
discuss and evaluate the traceability of several Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) and GraphRAG systems. Finally, we provide an easy-to-use interface with a
pre-built Alzheimer's disease database for researchers to test the performance
of both standard RAG and GraphRAG.

TL;DR: LINKO是一个LLM增强的集成本体学习框架，通过同时利用多个医学本体图，在异构本体系统内和跨系统进行双轴知识传播，以增强医学概念表示学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献主要关注单一本体系统或多个孤立本体系统的领域知识，缺乏统一的跨本体连接整合，导致概念表示学习局限于本体内部关系。

Method: 1) 使用LLM通过包含概念描述和本体上下文的工程化提示提供图检索增强的初始化；2) 通过双轴知识传播联合学习：本体内部垂直传播和跨本体水平传播；3) 作为插件编码器与现有EHR预测模型兼容。

Result: 在两个公共数据集上的广泛实验验证了LINKO优于最先进基线方法，在数据有限和罕见疾病预测场景中表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LINKO框架成功整合了多个医学本体系统的知识，通过双轴传播机制显著提升了医学概念表示学习效果，特别是在数据稀缺情况下表现优异。

Abstract: Medical ontology graphs map external knowledge to medical codes in electronic
health records via structured relationships. By leveraging domain-approved
connections (e.g., parent-child), predictive models can generate richer medical
concept representations by incorporating contextual information from related
concepts. However, existing literature primarily focuses on incorporating
domain knowledge from a single ontology system, or from multiple ontology
systems (e.g., diseases, drugs, and procedures) in isolation, without
integrating them into a unified learning structure. Consequently, concept
representation learning often remains limited to intra-ontology relationships,
overlooking cross-ontology connections. In this paper, we propose LINKO, a
large language model (LLM)-augmented integrative ontology learning framework
that leverages multiple ontology graphs simultaneously by enabling dual-axis
knowledge propagation both within and across heterogeneous ontology systems to
enhance medical concept representation learning. Specifically, LINKO first
employs LLMs to provide a graph-retrieval-augmented initialization for ontology
concept embedding, through an engineered prompt that includes concept
descriptions, and is further augmented with ontology context. Second, our
method jointly learns the medical concepts in diverse ontology graphs by
performing knowledge propagation in two axes: (1) intra-ontology vertical
propagation across hierarchical ontology levels and (2) inter-ontology
horizontal propagation within every level in parallel. Last, through extensive
experiments on two public datasets, we validate the superior performance of
LINKO over state-of-the-art baselines. As a plug-in encoder compatible with
existing EHR predictive models, LINKO further demonstrates enhanced robustness
in scenarios involving limited data availability and rare disease prediction.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在复杂推理任务表现出色但在简单交互任务中表现不佳的问题，弥合陈述性知识和程序性知识之间的差距

Method: 将基于强化学习的决策重新表述为语言建模任务，通过语言引导的策略生成和基于环境反馈的在线强化学习进行迭代优化

Result: TiG成功弥合了陈述性和程序性知识之间的差距，以显著更少的数据和计算需求达到与传统RL方法竞争的性能，并提供逐步的自然语言解释

Conclusion: TiG框架有效结合了LLMs的世界知识和推理能力与RL的环境交互学习，为复杂交互任务提供了透明和可解释的决策方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks such as
mathematics and coding, yet they frequently struggle with simple interactive
tasks that young children perform effortlessly. This discrepancy highlights a
critical gap between declarative knowledge (knowing about something) and
procedural knowledge (knowing how to do something). Although traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) agents can acquire procedural knowledge through
environmental interaction, they often operate as black boxes and require
substantial training data. In contrast, LLMs possess extensive world knowledge
and reasoning capabilities, but are unable to effectively convert this static
knowledge into dynamic decision-making in interactive settings. To address this
challenge, we propose Think in Games (TiG), a novel framework that empowers
LLMs to develop procedural understanding through direct interaction with game
environments, while retaining their inherent reasoning and explanatory
abilities. Specifically, TiG reformulates RL-based decision-making as a
language modeling task: LLMs generate language-guided policies, which are
refined iteratively through online reinforcement learning based on
environmental feedback. Our experimental results show that TiG successfully
bridges the gap between declarative and procedural knowledge, achieving
competitive performance with dramatically lower data and computational demands
compared to conventional RL methods. Moreover, TiG provides step-by-step
natural language explanations for its decisions, greatly improving transparency
and interpretability in complex interactive tasks.

TL;DR: AHELM是一个新的音频-语言模型基准测试，整合了多个数据集和两个新的合成数据集，从10个重要方面全面评估模型性能，并标准化了提示词和评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的音频-语言模型评估缺乏标准化基准，大多数基准只测试一两个能力，且忽略了公平性、安全性等重要评估维度，不同模型之间难以公平比较。

Method: 创建AHELM基准，整合多个数据集（包括新的PARADE和CoRe-Bench合成数据集），标准化提示词、推理参数和评估指标，测试14个开源和闭源API模型以及3个基线系统。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro在10个方面中的5个排名第一，但在ASR任务中表现出群体不公平性；基线系统表现良好，其中一个仅具有语音转文本能力的系统总体排名第五。

Conclusion: AHELM为音频-语言模型提供了全面的标准化评估框架，揭示了当前模型的优势和不足，特别是公平性问题，该基准将持续更新以促进该领域的发展。

Abstract: Evaluations of audio-language models (ALMs) -- multimodal models that take
interleaved audio and text as input and output text -- are hindered by the lack
of standardized benchmarks; most benchmarks measure only one or two
capabilities and omit evaluative aspects such as fairness or safety.
Furthermore, comparison across models is difficult as separate evaluations test
a limited number of models and use different prompting methods and inference
parameters. To address these shortfalls, we introduce AHELM, a benchmark that
aggregates various datasets -- including 2 new synthetic audio-text datasets
called PARADE, which evaluates the ALMs on avoiding stereotypes, and
CoRe-Bench, which measures reasoning over conversational audio through
inferential multi-turn question answering -- to holistically measure the
performance of ALMs across 10 aspects we have identified as important to the
development and usage of ALMs: audio perception, knowledge, reasoning, emotion
detection, bias, fairness, multilinguality, robustness, toxicity, and safety.
We also standardize the prompts, inference parameters, and evaluation metrics
to ensure equitable comparisons across models. We test 14 open-weight and
closed-API ALMs from 3 developers and 3 additional simple baseline systems each
consisting of an automatic speech recognizer and a language model. Our results
show that while Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks top in 5 out of 10 aspects, it exhibits
group unfairness ($p=0.01$) on ASR tasks whereas most of the other models do
not. We also find that the baseline systems perform reasonably well on AHELM,
with one ranking 5th overall despite having only speech-to-text capabilities.
For transparency, all raw prompts, model generations, and outputs are available
on our website at https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/audio/v1.0.0. AHELM is
intended to be a living benchmark and new datasets and models will be added
over time.

Abstract: Forgetting as a knowledge management operation deliberately ignores parts of
the knowledge and beliefs of an agent, for various reasons. Forgetting has many
facets, one may want to forget parts of the syntax, a proposition, or a
conditional. In the literature, two main operators suitable for performing
forgetting have been proposed and investigated in depth: First, variable
elimination is a syntactical method that blends out certain atomic variables to
focus on the rest of the language. It has been mainly used in the area of logic
programming and answer set programming. Second, contraction in AGM belief
revision theory effectively removes propositions from belief sets under logical
deduction. Both operations rely mainly on classical logics. In this article, we
take an epistemic perspective and study forgetting operations in epistemic
states with richer semantic structures, but with clear links to propositional
logic. This allows us to investigate what forgetting in the epistemic
background means, thereby lifting well-known and novel forgetting operations to
the epistemic level. We present five general types of epistemic forgetting and
instantiate them with seven concrete forgetting operations for Spohn's ranking
functions. We take inspiration from postulates of forgetting both from logic
programming and AGM theory to propose a rich landscape of axioms for evaluating
forgetting operations. Finally, we evaluate all concrete forgetting operations
according to all postulates, leading to a novel comprehensive overview
highlighting differences and commonalities among the forgetting operators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的模型学习方法大多假设动作是完整的STRIPS动作或所有谓词都可观测，但实际应用中状态往往不完整，动作参数也不完全可见，需要更现实的学习设置

Method: 引入STRIPS+变体，允许动作参数在前提条件中隐式存在；提出SYNTH算法，通过构建分层的前提条件表达式序列来唯一确定对象并隐式地接地动作参数

Result: 建立了SYNTH算法的正确性和完备性，并在从现有STRIPS领域衍生的STRIPS+模型生成的状态-动作轨迹上测试了其可扩展性

Conclusion: SYNTH算法能够有效学习包含隐式参数和存在量化的STRIPS+模型，为从部分可观测状态和动作中学习领域模型提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Consider the problem of learning a lifted STRIPS model of the sliding-tile
puzzle from random state-action traces where the states represent the location
of the tiles only, and the actions are the labels up, down, left, and right,
with no arguments. Two challenges are involved in this problem. First, the
states are not full STRIPS states, as some predicates are missing, like the
atoms representing the position of the ``blank''. Second, the actions are not
full STRIPS either, as they do not reveal all the objects involved in the
actions effects and preconditions. Previous approaches have addressed different
versions of this model learning problem, but most assume that actions in the
traces are full STRIPS actions or that the domain predicates are all
observable. The new setting considered in this work is more ``realistic'', as
the atoms observed convey the state of the world but not full STRIPS states,
and the actions reveal the arguments needed for selecting the action but not
the ones needed for modeling it in STRIPS. For formulating and addressing the
learning problem, we introduce a variant of STRIPS, which we call STRIPS+,
where certain STRIPS action arguments can be left implicit in preconditions
which can also involve a limited form of existential quantification. The
learning problem becomes the problem of learning STRIPS+ models from STRIPS+
state-action traces. For this, the proposed learning algorithm, called SYNTH,
constructs a stratified sequence (conjunction) of precondition expressions or
``queries'' for each action, that denote unique objects in the state and ground
the implicit action arguments in STRIPS+. The correctness and completeness of
SYNTH is established, and its scalability is tested on state-action traces
obtained from STRIPS+ models derived from existing STRIPS domains.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态浏览基准测试往往可以通过浅层的固定工作流程解决，无法真正测试模型在细粒度视觉推理、来源验证和长时程工具使用方面的多模态能力。

Method: 采用空间-时间外推法构建测试项，每个任务包含多个弱局部视觉信号，需要通过迭代的文本-图像搜索进行提取和传播，并在检索噪声下进行交叉验证。提供模型无关的代理框架和浏览工具。

Result: 最强代理(o3)在无搜索情况下准确率为15.1%，在框架下滚动搜索后达到36.0%；最强的开源模型(Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct)无搜索准确率为0.0%，20轮搜索后为6.9%。

Conclusion: 该基准测试揭示了现有模型在来源验证、基于部件的推理和长时程规划方面的失败，为多模态语言模型的进一步发展提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Large multimodal language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed as web
agents, yet many multimodal browsing benchmarks can be solved by shallow, fixed
workflows that lean on high-recall image search and nearby text-masking the
genuinely multimodal challenges of fine-grained visual reasoning, provenance
verification, and long-horizon tool use. We introduce MMSearch-Plus, a
benchmark of 311 tasks that highly demand multimodal understanding while
preserving the difficulty profile of strong text-only browsing suites. Each
item is constructed to contain multiple weak, localized visual signals that
must be extracted, propagated through iterative text-image search, and
cross-validated under retrieval noise before answering. Our curation procedure,
Spatial-Temporal Extrapolation, seeds questions whose answers require
extrapolating from spatial cues (micro-text, part-level appearance, layouts,
signage) and temporal traces (broadcast overlays, seasonal context) to
out-of-image facts such as events, dates, and venues. We provide a
model-agnostic agent framework with browsing tools and evaluate a range of
closed and open MLLMs. The strongest agent (o3) attains 15.1% without search
and 36.0% accuracy with rollout under our framework, while a strong open-source
model (Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct) achieves 0.0% without search and 6.9% after 20
rounds of search. Beyond answer accuracy, we assess bounding-box production and
cropped-image search, and conduct an error analysis that surfaces failures in
source verification, part-based reasoning, and long-horizon planning.

Motivation: 传统智慧测量依赖自我报告，无法体现智慧固有的谦逊和不确定性特征。需要一种计算框架来捕捉智慧的多维性和置信度，以改进心理学测量并实现更人性化的人工智能。

Method: 使用Z数模糊推理系统，每个决策用智慧分数（限制）和置信度分数（确定性）表示。通过100名参与者对文化中性图画道德困境的口头反应，映射到五个智慧成分，使用21条规则和基于高斯核密度估计的隶属函数进行组合。

Conclusion: 该研究将智慧形式化为多维、不确定性感知的构念，通过Z数操作化。不仅推进了心理学测量，还为AI系统提供了可解释、置信度敏感的推理能力，在严格计算和类人判断之间找到了安全中间地带。

Abstract: Background: Wisdom is a superordinate construct that embraces perspective
taking, reflectiveness, prosocial orientation, reflective empathetic action,
and intellectual humility. Unlike conventional models of reasoning that are
rigidly bound by binary thinking, wisdom unfolds in shades of ambiguity,
requiring both graded evaluation and self-reflective humility. Current measures
depend on self-reports and seldom reflect the humility and uncertainty inherent
in wise reasoning. A computational framework that takes into account both
multidimensionality and confidence has the potential to improve psychological
science and allow humane AI. Method: We present a fuzzy inference system with Z
numbers, each of the decisions being expressed in terms of a wisdom score
(restriction) and confidence score (certainty). As part of this study,
participants (N = 100) were exposed to culturally neutral pictorial moral
dilemma tasks to which they generated think-aloud linguistic responses, which
were mapped into five theoretically based components of wisdom. The scores of
each individual component were combined using a base of 21 rules, with
membership functions tuned via Gaussian kernel density estimation. Results: In
a proof of concept study, the system produced dual attribute wisdom
representations that correlated modestly but significantly with established
scales while showing negligible relations with unrelated traits, supporting
convergent and divergent validity. Contribution: The contribution is to
formalize wisdom as a multidimensional, uncertainty-conscious construct,
operationalized in the form of Z-numbers. In addition to progressing
measurement in psychology, it calculates how fuzzy Z numbers can provide AI
systems with interpretable, confidence-sensitive reasoning that affords a safe,
middle ground between rigorous computation and human-like judgment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的反事实解释方法虽然能通过最小修改现有计划来展示不同输出，但无法捕捉问题的高层特性。需要一种能够识别规划问题本身最小修改的方法，以产生满足特定性质的反事实场景。

Method: 提出了两种基于显式量化必须满足性质ψ的计划的定性反事实场景实例化方法。分析了允许对规划问题P进行不同类型修改时生成此类反事实场景的计算复杂性。

Result: 研究表明生成反事实场景的计算成本通常与计算规划问题P的计划相当，证明了该方法的实际可行性。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建该领域的实用算法提供了基础，反事实场景解释方法在保持计算效率的同时能够提供更高层次的规划问题特性分析。

Abstract: Counterfactual Explanations (CEs) are a powerful technique used to explain
Machine Learning models by showing how the input to a model should be minimally
changed for the model to produce a different output. Similar proposals have
been made in the context of Automated Planning, where CEs have been
characterised in terms of minimal modifications to an existing plan that would
result in the satisfaction of a different goal. While such explanations may
help diagnose faults and reason about the characteristics of a plan, they fail
to capture higher-level properties of the problem being solved. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel explanation paradigm that is based on
counterfactual scenarios. In particular, given a planning problem $P$ and an
\ltlf formula $\psi$ defining desired properties of a plan, counterfactual
scenarios identify minimal modifications to $P$ such that it admits plans that
comply with $\psi$. In this paper, we present two qualitative instantiations of
counterfactual scenarios based on an explicit quantification over plans that
must satisfy $\psi$. We then characterise the computational complexity of
generating such counterfactual scenarios when different types of changes are
allowed on $P$. We show that producing counterfactual scenarios is often only
as expensive as computing a plan for $P$, thus demonstrating the practical
viability of our proposal and ultimately providing a framework to construct
practical algorithms in this area.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HealthProcessAI是一个集成多LLM的GenAI框架，通过自动化流程挖掘分析和报告生成，简化了医疗流程挖掘应用的技术门槛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决流程挖掘在医疗领域应用的技术复杂性、缺乏标准化方法和培训资源有限等障碍，使技术分析结果更容易被临床医生、数据科学家和研究人员理解。

Method: 开发了一个综合框架，包装了Python(PM4PY)和R(bupaR)库，集成多个大型语言模型(LLM)来自动解释流程图和生成报告，使用脓毒症进展数据作为概念验证案例。

Result: 框架成功处理了四个概念验证场景的脓毒症数据，技术性能稳健。LLM评估显示Claude Sonnet-4和Gemini 2.5-Pro获得最高一致性分数(3.79/4.0和3.65/4.0)。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合结构化分析和AI驱动的解释，代表了将复杂流程挖掘结果转化为医疗应用可操作见解的新方法学进展。

Abstract: Process mining has emerged as a powerful analytical technique for
understanding complex healthcare workflows. However, its application faces
significant barriers, including technical complexity, a lack of standardized
approaches, and limited access to practical training resources. We introduce
HealthProcessAI, a GenAI framework designed to simplify process mining
applications in healthcare and epidemiology by providing a comprehensive
wrapper around existing Python (PM4PY) and R (bupaR) libraries. To address
unfamiliarity and improve accessibility, the framework integrates multiple
Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated process map interpretation and
report generation, helping translate technical analyses into outputs that
diverse users can readily understand. We validated the framework using sepsis
progression data as a proof-of-concept example and compared the outputs of five
state-of-the-art LLM models through the OpenRouter platform. To test its
functionality, the framework successfully processed sepsis data across four
proof-of-concept scenarios, demonstrating robust technical performance and its
capability to generate reports through automated LLM analysis. LLM evaluation
using five independent LLMs as automated evaluators revealed distinct model
strengths: Claude Sonnet-4 and Gemini 2.5-Pro achieved the highest consistency
scores (3.79/4.0 and 3.65/4.0) when evaluated by automated LLM assessors. By
integrating multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated interpretation
and report generation, the framework addresses widespread unfamiliarity with
process mining outputs, making them more accessible to clinicians, data
scientists, and researchers. This structured analytics and AI-driven
interpretation combination represents a novel methodological advance in
translating complex process mining results into potentially actionable insights
for healthcare applications.

TL;DR: 通过学习域中解决计划实例的状态函数，提出了能够自动横向域的广义重要点发现框架，构建有向广义重要点图来提高规划器性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统重要点提取算法在某些规划问题中效果不佳，需要一种能够自动横向域的方法来发现描述中间目标的广义重要点

Method: 使用状态函数学习域中解决计划实例的广义重要点，构建有向广义重要点图，包括备循环可能性的重复子计划，并将其用于解决新问题实例的启发式算法

Result: 实验结果显示，从少量小型实例学习到的广义重要点图在同一域的更大实例中也有效，当识别出表示重复的循环时，启发式算法性能比基准方法有显著提升

Conclusion: 广义重要点能够捐取可解释且对自动规划器有用的域信息，这些信息可以从同一域的少量计划中发现

Abstract: We propose a new framework for discovering landmarks that automatically
generalize across a domain. These generalized landmarks are learned from a set
of solved instances and describe intermediate goals for planning problems where
traditional landmark extraction algorithms fall short. Our generalized
landmarks extend beyond the predicates of a domain by using state functions
that are independent of the objects of a specific problem and apply to all
similar objects, thus capturing repetition. Based on these functions, we
construct a directed generalized landmark graph that defines the landmark
progression, including loop possibilities for repetitive subplans. We show how
to use this graph in a heuristic to solve new problem instances of the same
domain. Our results show that the generalized landmark graphs learned from a
few small instances are also effective for larger instances in the same domain.
If a loop that indicates repetition is identified, we see a significant
improvement in heuristic performance over the baseline. Generalized landmarks
capture domain information that is interpretable and useful to an automated
planner. This information can be discovered from a small set of plans for the
same domain.

Motivation: 许多高层次多智能体规划问题（如多机器人导航）可以用确定性动作和观察有效建模，但现有Dec-POMDP求解器无法高效处理大规模问题

Method: 基于经典联合均衡搜索策略框架，提出了迭代确定性POMDP规划（IDPP）方法，专门针对确定性转移和观察条件的大规模Det-Dec-POMDPs进行优化

Result: IDPP方法能够处理当前Dec-POMDP求解器无法高效解决的大规模确定性分散POMDP问题

Conclusion: Det-Dec-POMDPs为多智能体规划提供了有效的建模框架，IDPP求解器为此类问题的实际应用提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Many high-level multi-agent planning problems, including multi-robot
navigation and path planning, can be effectively modeled using deterministic
actions and observations.
  In this work, we focus on such domains and introduce the class of
Deterministic Decentralized POMDPs (Det-Dec-POMDPs). This is a subclass of
Dec-POMDPs characterized by deterministic transitions and observations
conditioned on the state and joint actions.
  We then propose a practical solver called Iterative Deterministic POMDP
Planning (IDPP). This method builds on the classic Joint Equilibrium Search for
Policies framework and is specifically optimized to handle large-scale
Det-Dec-POMDPs that current Dec-POMDP solvers are unable to address
efficiently.

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated framework that combines traditional network
optimization models with large language models (LLMs) to deliver interactive,
explainable, and role-aware decision support for supply chain planning. The
proposed system bridges the gap between complex operations research outputs and
business stakeholder understanding by generating natural language summaries,
contextual visualizations, and tailored key performance indicators (KPIs). The
core optimization model addresses tactical inventory redistribution across a
network of distribution centers for multi-period and multi-item, using a
mixed-integer formulation. The technical architecture incorporates AI agents,
RESTful APIs, and a dynamic user interface to support real-time interaction,
configuration updates, and simulation-based insights. A case study demonstrates
how the system improves planning outcomes by preventing stockouts, reducing
costs, and maintaining service levels. Future extensions include integrating
private LLMs, transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian neural
networks to enhance explainability, adaptability, and real-time
decision-making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了A-MHA*算法，将多启发式A*（MHA*）扩展为随时算法，能够快速找到可行解并持续改进，直到时间耗尽。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的MHA*算法虽然能利用多个不可采纳的启发式函数加速搜索，但它是一次性算法，无法随时间持续改进解的质量，且需要精心设置膨胀因子。

Method: 受随时修复A*（ARA*）启发，将ARA*的概念精确适配到MHA*框架中，开发了随时多启发式A*（A-MHA*）算法。

Result: A-MHA*在保持原有次优性和完备性保证的同时，实现了随时搜索功能。在3D路径规划和滑块拼图领域的实验验证了其性能。

Conclusion: A-MHA*成功地将MHA*扩展为随时算法，能够快速获得可行解并持续优化，相比原始MHA*和其他随时算法表现出更好的性能。

Abstract: Designing good heuristic functions for graph search requires adequate domain
knowledge. It is often easy to design heuristics that perform well and
correlate with the underlying true cost-to-go values in certain parts of the
search space but these may not be admissible throughout the domain thereby
affecting the optimality guarantees of the search. Bounded suboptimal search
using several such partially good but inadmissible heuristics was developed in
Multi-Heuristic A* (MHA*). Although MHA* leverages multiple inadmissible
heuristics to potentially generate a faster suboptimal solution, the original
version does not improve the solution over time. It is a one shot algorithm
that requires careful setting of inflation factors to obtain a desired one time
solution. In this work, we tackle this issue by extending MHA* to an anytime
version that finds a feasible suboptimal solution quickly and continually
improves it until time runs out. Our work is inspired from the Anytime
Repairing A* (ARA*) algorithm. We prove that our precise adaptation of ARA*
concepts in the MHA* framework preserves the original suboptimal and
completeness guarantees and enhances MHA* to perform in an anytime fashion.
Furthermore, we report the performance of A-MHA* in 3-D path planning domain
and sliding tiles puzzle and compare against MHA* and other anytime algorithms.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MEDLEY框架通过保留多个AI模型的多样性输出而非追求共识，将模型偏见视为潜在优势，将幻觉作为临床验证的假设，增强医疗AI系统的透明度和临床监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将AI偏见视为需要消除的缺陷，但人类推理本身就包含偏见，这些偏见可能具有价值。作者认为应该重新审视AI不完美性，将其作为资源而非缺陷。

Method: 提出MEDLEY概念框架，协调多个AI模型并保留其多样性输出。开发概念验证演示器，使用30多个大型语言模型，在合成病例中同时保留共识和少数观点。

Result: 演示器成功使诊断不确定性和潜在偏见透明化，便于临床监督。虽然还不是经过验证的临床工具，但展示了结构化多样性如何增强临床监督下的医疗推理。

Conclusion: MEDLEY通过重新定义AI不完美性为资源，为开发可信医疗AI系统开辟了新的监管、伦理和创新途径，实现了范式转变。

Abstract: Bias in medical artificial intelligence is conventionally viewed as a defect
requiring elimination. However, human reasoning inherently incorporates biases
shaped by education, culture, and experience, suggesting their presence may be
inevitable and potentially valuable. We propose MEDLEY (Medical Ensemble
Diagnostic system with Leveraged diversitY), a conceptual framework that
orchestrates multiple AI models while preserving their diverse outputs rather
than collapsing them into a consensus. Unlike traditional approaches that
suppress disagreement, MEDLEY documents model-specific biases as potential
strengths and treats hallucinations as provisional hypotheses for clinician
verification. A proof-of-concept demonstrator was developed using over 30 large
language models, creating a minimum viable product that preserved both
consensus and minority views in synthetic cases, making diagnostic uncertainty
and latent biases transparent for clinical oversight. While not yet a validated
clinical tool, the demonstration illustrates how structured diversity can
enhance medical reasoning under clinician supervision. By reframing AI
imperfection as a resource, MEDLEY offers a paradigm shift that opens new
regulatory, ethical, and innovation pathways for developing trustworthy medical
AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法大多忽视科学文档的层次结构以及文本和视觉元素的语义整合，需要一种能够直接解决这两个挑战的新方法。

Method: 提出Poster Tree层次化中间表示来联合编码文档结构和视觉-文本关系，采用多智能体协作策略，由内容摘要和布局规划专家智能体迭代协调并提供相互反馈。

Result: 在多个学术领域的广泛实验表明，该方法在定性和定量评估中都优于现有基线，生成的海报质量最接近专家设计的地面真实值，具有更好的信息保存、结构清晰度和用户偏好。

Conclusion: PosterForest框架通过创新的层次化表示和多智能体协作，成功解决了科学海报生成中的结构建模和视觉-文本整合问题，取得了显著优于现有方法的效果。

Abstract: We present a novel training-free framework, \textit{PosterForest}, for
automated scientific poster generation. Unlike prior approaches, which largely
neglect the hierarchical structure of scientific documents and the semantic
integration of textual and visual elements, our method addresses both
challenges directly. We introduce the \textit{Poster Tree}, a hierarchical
intermediate representation that jointly encodes document structure and
visual-textual relationships at multiple levels. Our framework employs a
multi-agent collaboration strategy, where agents specializing in content
summarization and layout planning iteratively coordinate and provide mutual
feedback. This approach enables the joint optimization of logical consistency,
content fidelity, and visual coherence. Extensive experiments on multiple
academic domains show that our method outperforms existing baselines in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The resulting posters achieve quality
closest to expert-designed ground truth and deliver superior information
preservation, structural clarity, and user preference.

*Fabrizio Fagiolo,Nicolo' Vescera*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于旅行商问题的变分量子算法，通过紧凑排列编码减少量子比特需求，采用优化-冻结-重用策略，在训练实例上优化电路结构后冻结并重用于新实例，仅需快速重新优化参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决旅行商问题的量子算法需要减少量子比特需求和计算成本，特别是在NISQ设备上实现时，需要避免昂贵的结构搜索过程。

Method: 使用紧凑排列编码减少量子比特需求；采用优化-冻结-重用策略：先在训练实例上用模拟退火优化电路结构，然后冻结该结构，在新实例上仅重新优化电路参数。

Result: 在4-7个城市的40个随机对称实例上，4城市达到100%最优路径采样概率，5城市90%，6城市80%，7城市降至约20%，显示出方法的可扩展性限制。

Conclusion: 该方法对中等规模问题展现出强大的泛化能力，冻结Ansatz能显著减少求解时间而不降低解质量，但存在可扩展性限制，未来可扩展到车辆路径和作业车间调度等更复杂问题。

Abstract: In this paper we present a variational algorithm for the Traveling Salesman
Problem (TSP) that combines (i) a compact encoding of permutations, which
reduces the qubit requirement too, (ii) an optimize-freeze-reuse strategy:
where the circuit topology (``Ansatz'') is first optimized on a training
instance by Simulated Annealing (SA), then ``frozen'' and re-used on novel
instances, limited to a rapid re-optimization of only the circuit parameters.
This pipeline eliminates costly structural research in testing, making the
procedure immediately implementable on NISQ hardware.
  On a set of $40$ randomly generated symmetric instances that span $4 - 7$
cities, the resulting Ansatz achieves an average optimal trip sampling
probability of $100\%$ for 4 city cases, $90\%$ for 5 city cases and $80\%$ for
6 city cases. With 7 cities the success rate drops markedly to an average of
$\sim 20\%$, revealing the onset of scalability limitations of the proposed
method.
  The results show robust generalization ability for moderate problem sizes and
indicate how freezing the Ansatz can dramatically reduce time-to-solution
without degrading solution quality. The paper also discusses scalability
limitations, the impact of ``warm-start'' initialization of parameters, and
prospects for extension to more complex problems, such as Vehicle Routing and
Job-Shop Scheduling.

TL;DR: 本文提出了在给定高层摘要因果图的背景下，保证时间变量间微观层面边可定向性的条件，为复杂时间系统中的因果发现提供理论保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列分析中理解时间变量间的因果关系是一个核心挑战，特别是在完整因果结构未知的情况下。专家通常能够提供高层摘要因果图来捕捉主要因果关系，但如何利用这种知识来指导微观层面的因果发现需要理论支持。

Method: 提出了在给定摘要因果图和假设存在忠实且因果充分的分布的条件下，保证微观层面边可定向性的理论条件。这些条件即使在宏观层面存在循环或双向边的情况下也适用。

Result: 研究结果为微观层面的边定向提供了理论保证，即使在宏观层面存在复杂结构（如循环或双向边）的情况下也能工作。

Conclusion: 这些发现为利用摘要因果图来指导复杂时间系统中的因果发现提供了实用指导，强调了将专家知识融入观测时间序列数据因果推理的价值。

Abstract: Understanding causal relations between temporal variables is a central
challenge in time series analysis, particularly when the full causal structure
is unknown. Even when the full causal structure cannot be fully specified,
experts often succeed in providing a high-level abstraction of the causal
graph, known as a summary causal graph, which captures the main causal
relations between different time series while abstracting away micro-level
details. In this work, we present conditions that guarantee the orientability
of micro-level edges between temporal variables given the background knowledge
encoded in a summary causal graph and assuming having access to a faithful and
causally sufficient distribution with respect to the true unknown graph. Our
results provide theoretical guarantees for edge orientation at the micro-level,
even in the presence of cycles or bidirected edges at the macro-level. These
findings offer practical guidance for leveraging SCGs to inform causal
discovery in complex temporal systems and highlight the value of incorporating
expert knowledge to improve causal inference from observational time series
data.

TL;DR: 提出Tree-guided Diffusion Planner (TDP)，一种零样本测试时规划框架，通过结构化轨迹生成平衡探索与利用，在非凸目标、不可微约束和多奖励场景中优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的规划方法在凸可微奖励场景表现良好，但在现实世界的非凸目标、不可微约束和多奖励结构中效果显著下降。监督规划方法需要任务特定训练，限制了测试时灵活性和零样本泛化能力

Method: 将测试时规划构建为树搜索问题，采用双层采样过程：1) 通过无训练粒子引导生成多样化父轨迹进行广泛探索；2) 通过任务目标引导的快速条件去噪精炼子轨迹

Result: 在迷宫金币收集、机器人手臂块操作和AntMaze多目标探索三个任务中，TDP始终优于最先进方法

Conclusion: TDP通过探索多样化轨迹区域并利用扩展解空间中的梯度信息，仅使用预训练模型和测试时奖励信号，成功解决了梯度引导的局限性

Abstract: Planning with pretrained diffusion models has emerged as a promising approach
for solving test-time guided control problems. However, standard gradient
guidance typically performs optimally under convex and differentiable reward
landscapes, showing substantially reduced effectiveness in real-world scenarios
involving non-convex objectives, non-differentiable constraints, and
multi-reward structures. Furthermore, recent supervised planning approaches
require task-specific training or value estimators, which limits test-time
flexibility and zero-shot generalization. We propose a Tree-guided Diffusion
Planner (TDP), a zero-shot test-time planning framework that balances
exploration and exploitation through structured trajectory generation. We frame
test-time planning as a tree search problem using a bi-level sampling process:
(1) diverse parent trajectories are produced via training-free particle
guidance to encourage broad exploration, and (2) sub-trajectories are refined
through fast conditional denoising guided by task objectives. TDP addresses the
limitations of gradient guidance by exploring diverse trajectory regions and
harnessing gradient information across this expanded solution space using only
pretrained models and test-time reward signals. We evaluate TDP on three
diverse tasks: maze gold-picking, robot arm block manipulation, and AntMaze
multi-goal exploration. TDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on all tasks. The project page can be found at:

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种协作式多代理系统(MAS)，模拟临床诊疗团队进行病理识别，在SOAP病程记录的S和O部分进行诊断推理，显著提高了对凑式心力衰竭等疾病的识别准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床文档的准确解释对患者护理至关重要，但单一模型方法缺乏高风险临床任务所需的稳健性。需要更精准、可靠的临床决策支持工具。

Method: 设计了一个由Manager代理协调的动态多专业代理团队，进行层次化、迭代式辩论以达成共识。系统仅分析SOAP病程记录中的主观(S)和客观(O)部分，模拟从原始数据到评估的诊断推理过程。

Result: 在经过澄清的420份MIMIC-III病程记录数据集上评估，动态多代理配置在识别凑式心力衰竭、急性肾伤害和感染性伏克等疾病方面表现出一致的性能提升。质性分析显示该结构能有效地揭示和重新考量冲突证据。

Conclusion: 通过模拟临床团队的推理过程，该系统为开发更准确、稳健和可解释的临床决策支持工具提供了有前景的路径，尽管有时可能存在群体思维的风险。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of clinical narratives is critical for patient care,
but the complexity of these notes makes automation challenging. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise, single-model approaches can lack the
robustness required for high-stakes clinical tasks. We introduce a
collaborative multi-agent system (MAS) that models a clinical consultation team
to address this gap. The system is tasked with identifying clinical problems by
analyzing only the Subjective (S) and Objective (O) sections of SOAP notes,
simulating the diagnostic reasoning process of synthesizing raw data into an
assessment. A Manager agent orchestrates a dynamically assigned team of
specialist agents who engage in a hierarchical, iterative debate to reach a
consensus. We evaluated our MAS against a single-agent baseline on a curated
dataset of 420 MIMIC-III notes. The dynamic multi-agent configuration
demonstrated consistently improved performance in identifying congestive heart
failure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis. Qualitative analysis of the agent
debates reveals that this structure effectively surfaces and weighs conflicting
evidence, though it can occasionally be susceptible to groupthink. By modeling
a clinical team's reasoning process, our system offers a promising path toward
more accurate, robust, and interpretable clinical decision support tools.

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效处理未注册表面网格的动作预测和转移问题，为处理原始3D扫描数据提供了一种新的解决方案。

Abstract: Unregistered surface meshes, especially raw 3D scans, present significant
challenges for automatic computation of plausible deformations due to the lack
of established point-wise correspondences and the presence of noise in the
data. In this paper, we propose a new, rig-free, data-driven framework for
motion prediction and transfer on such body meshes. Our method couples a robust
motion embedding network with a learned per-vertex feature field to generate a
spatio-temporal deformation field, which drives the mesh deformation. Extensive
evaluations, including quantitative benchmarks and qualitative visuals on tasks
such as walking and running, demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of
our approach on challenging unregistered meshes.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 基于SuGaR模型的两种正则化策略，通过有效秩正则化和神经SDF集成，改善了3D高斯拖散的网格重建质量和场景一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然SuGaR等现有模型在渲染方面提供了有效解决方案，但在视觉保真度和场景一致性方面仍有改进空间。需要解决单个高斯元形状和整体表面稳定性的常见限制问题。

Method: 1. 有效秩正则化：激励更平衡的"盘状"形状，避免极端各异性的"针状"形状，提高表面重建稳定性
2. 神经SDF集成：通过Eikonal损失正则化SDF，提供连续全局表面前知，引导高斯元与基础几何更好对齐

Result: 方法能够从3DGS数据中生成更准确和一致的视觉效果，显著改善了单个高斯元素的保真度和它们的集体表面行为。

Conclusion: 通过两种补充性的正则化策略，该工作有效提升了3D高斯拖散的网格重建质量，在保持渲染效果的同时提高了场景一致性和表面稳定性。

Abstract: Reconstructing high-quality 3D meshes and visuals from 3D Gaussian
Splatting(3DGS) still remains a central challenge in computer graphics.
Although existing models such as SuGaR offer effective solutions for rendering,
there is is still room to improve improve both visual fidelity and scene
consistency. This work builds upon SuGaR by introducing two complementary
regularization strategies that address common limitations in both the shape of
individual Gaussians and the coherence of the overall surface. The first
strategy introduces an effective rank regularization, motivated by recent
studies on Gaussian primitive structures. This regularization discourages
extreme anisotropy-specifically, "needle-like" shapes-by favoring more
balanced, "disk-like" forms that are better suited for stable surface
reconstruction. The second strategy integrates a neural Signed Distance
Function (SDF) into the optimization process. The SDF is regularized with an
Eikonal loss to maintain proper distance properties and provides a continuous
global surface prior, guiding Gaussians toward better alignment with the
underlying geometry. These two regularizations aim to improve both the fidelity
of individual Gaussian primitives and their collective surface behavior. The
final model can make more accurate and coherent visuals from 3DGS data.
