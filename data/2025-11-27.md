### [1] [Pygmalion Effect in Vision: Image-to-Clay Translation for Reflective Geometry Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21098)
*Gayoung Lee,Junho Kim,Jin-Hwa Kim,Junmo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Pygmalion Effect in Vision框架，通过图像到黏土转换来抑制镜面反射线索，同时保持几何一致性，从而改进含复杂反射的多视角图像的3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D重建中长期存在的反射问题，因为视角相关反射会导致外观和几何纠缠，影响重建质量。

Method: 采用双分支网络：基于BRDF的反射分支和黏土引导分支，联合训练使用合成的黏土状图像作为无反射监督信号。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验显示，在法线精度和网格完整性方面相比现有反射处理方法有显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过'去光泽化'将辐射度转换为中性表示，可以为反射物体几何学习提供强大的归纳偏置。

Abstract: Understanding reflection remains a long-standing challenge in 3D reconstruction due to the entanglement of appearance and geometry under view-dependent reflections. In this work, we present the Pygmalion Effect in Vision, a novel framework that metaphorically "sculpts" reflective objects into clay-like forms through image-to-clay translation. Inspired by the myth of Pygmalion, our method learns to suppress specular cues while preserving intrinsic geometric consistency, enabling robust reconstruction from multi-view images containing complex reflections. Specifically, we introduce a dual-branch network in which a BRDF-based reflective branch is complemented by a clay-guided branch that stabilizes geometry and refines surface normals. The two branches are trained jointly using the synthesized clay-like images, which provide a neutral, reflection-free supervision signal that complements the reflective views. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate substantial improvement in normal accuracy and mesh completeness over existing reflection-handling methods. Beyond technical gains, our framework reveals that seeing by unshining, translating radiance into neutrality, can serve as a powerful inductive bias for reflective object geometry learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CtrlVDiff是一个统一的扩散框架，通过整合多种图形模态（深度、法线、分割、边缘和内在属性）来解决视频理解和可控生成的双重挑战，支持分层编辑并保持时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统仅使用几何线索的方法在指定外观、材质和光照方面存在不足，限制了物理上有意义的编辑（如重新照明或材质交换），并经常导致时间漂移。

Method: 提出CtrlVDiff模型，采用混合模态控制策略（HMCS）来路由和融合多种模态特征，并构建了MMVideo数据集进行训练。

Result: 在理解和生成基准测试中，CtrlVDiff提供了优越的可控性和保真度，支持分层编辑并超越了现有最先进基线。

Conclusion: 通过整合图形基础模态，CtrlVDiff实现了精确、可预测的视频控制，同时在部分模态缺失时仍保持鲁棒性。

Abstract: We tackle the dual challenges of video understanding and controllable video generation within a unified diffusion framework. Our key insights are two-fold: geometry-only cues (e.g., depth, edges) are insufficient: they specify layout but under-constrain appearance, materials, and illumination, limiting physically meaningful edits such as relighting or material swaps and often causing temporal drift. Enriching the model with additional graphics-based modalities (intrinsics and semantics) provides complementary constraints that both disambiguate understanding and enable precise, predictable control during generation.
  However, building a single model that uses many heterogeneous cues introduces two core difficulties. Architecturally, the model must accept any subset of modalities, remain robust to missing inputs, and inject control signals without sacrificing temporal consistency. Data-wise, training demands large-scale, temporally aligned supervision that ties real videos to per-pixel multimodal annotations.
  We then propose CtrlVDiff, a unified diffusion model trained with a Hybrid Modality Control Strategy (HMCS) that routes and fuses features from depth, normals, segmentation, edges, and graphics-based intrinsics (albedo, roughness, metallic), and re-renders videos from any chosen subset with strong temporal coherence. To enable this, we build MMVideo, a hybrid real-and-synthetic dataset aligned across modalities and captions. Across understanding and generation benchmarks, CtrlVDiff delivers superior controllability and fidelity, enabling layer-wise edits (relighting, material adjustment, object insertion) and surpassing state-of-the-art baselines while remaining robust when some modalities are unavailable.

### [3] [Are Neuro-Inspired Multi-Modal Vision-Language Models Resilient to Membership Inference Privacy Leakage?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20710)
*David Amebley,Sayanton Dibbo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种神经科学启发的拓扑正则化框架，用于增强多模态视觉语言模型对成员推理攻击的隐私保护能力，实验表明该方法能显著降低攻击成功率同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态模型的广泛应用，其训练数据的隐私泄露风险日益凸显。现有研究主要关注单模态系统的隐私攻击，而多模态模型的隐私脆弱性研究不足，特别是神经启发的多模态模型对隐私攻击的抵抗能力尚未被探索。

Method: 提出系统性的神经科学启发拓扑正则化框架(tau)，在三个视觉语言模型(BLIP、PaliGemma 2、ViT-GPT2)上应用，使用三个基准数据集(COCO、CC3M、NoCaps)进行实验，比较基线模型和神经变体模型的隐私攻击抵抗能力。

Result: 在BLIP模型和COCO数据集上的实验显示，神经变体VLM的成员推理攻击成功率平均ROC-AUC下降24%，同时模型效用(生成文本与参考文本的相似度)在MPNet和ROUGE-2指标上保持相似水平。其他模型和数据集上的实验进一步验证了结果的稳定性。

Conclusion: 神经启发的多模态视觉语言模型对隐私攻击具有更强的抵抗能力，且不会显著损害模型性能，这为理解多模态模型的隐私风险提供了新证据。

Abstract: In the age of agentic AI, the growing deployment of multi-modal models (MMs) has introduced new attack vectors that can leak sensitive training data in MMs, causing privacy leakage. This paper investigates a black-box privacy attack, i.e., membership inference attack (MIA) on multi-modal vision-language models (VLMs). State-of-the-art research analyzes privacy attacks primarily to unimodal AI-ML systems, while recent studies indicate MMs can also be vulnerable to privacy attacks. While researchers have demonstrated that biologically inspired neural network representations can improve unimodal model resilience against adversarial attacks, it remains unexplored whether neuro-inspired MMs are resilient against privacy attacks. In this work, we introduce a systematic neuroscience-inspired topological regularization (tau) framework to analyze MM VLMs resilience against image-text-based inference privacy attacks. We examine this phenomenon using three VLMs: BLIP, PaliGemma 2, and ViT-GPT2, across three benchmark datasets: COCO, CC3M, and NoCaps. Our experiments compare the resilience of baseline and neuro VLMs (with topological regularization), where the tau > 0 configuration defines the NEURO variant of VLM. Our results on the BLIP model using the COCO dataset illustrate that MIA attack success in NEURO VLMs drops by 24% mean ROC-AUC, while achieving similar model utility (similarities between generated and reference captions) in terms of MPNet and ROUGE-2 metrics. This shows neuro VLMs are comparatively more resilient against privacy attacks, while not significantly compromising model utility. Our extensive evaluation with PaliGemma 2 and ViT-GPT2 models, on two additional datasets: CC3M and NoCaps, further validates the consistency of the findings. This work contributes to the growing understanding of privacy risks in MMs and provides evidence on neuro VLMs privacy threat resilience.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inferix是一个专为世界模型设计的下一代推理引擎，通过优化的半自回归解码过程实现沉浸式世界合成，支持交互式视频流和评测，区别于高并发系统和传统视频扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 世界模型是智能体AI、具身AI和游戏等领域的核心模拟器，能够生成长序列、物理真实且交互式的高质量视频。扩展这些模型可以解锁视觉感知、理解和推理的新兴能力，超越当前以LLM为中心的视觉基础模型。

Method: 采用半自回归（块扩散）解码范式，结合扩散和自回归方法的优势，在块内应用扩散生成视频token，同时以前面块为条件，实现更连贯稳定的视频序列。通过重新引入LLM风格的KV缓存管理，克服标准视频扩散的限制。

Result: Inferix实现了高效、可变长度和高质量的视频生成，支持交互式视频流和性能分析，能够准确建模世界动态。

Conclusion: Inferix为世界模型探索提供了专门的推理引擎，希望社区共同推进其发展，促进世界模型的研究与应用。

Abstract: World models serve as core simulators for fields such as agentic AI, embodied AI, and gaming, capable of generating long, physically realistic, and interactive high-quality videos. Moreover, scaling these models could unlock emergent capabilities in visual perception, understanding, and reasoning, paving the way for a new paradigm that moves beyond current LLM-centric vision foundation models. A key breakthrough empowering them is the semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding paradigm, which merges the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive methods by generating video tokens in block-applying diffusion within each block while conditioning on previous ones, resulting in more coherent and stable video sequences. Crucially, it overcomes limitations of standard video diffusion by reintroducing LLM-style KV Cache management, enabling efficient, variable-length, and high-quality generation.
  Therefore, Inferix is specifically designed as a next-generation inference engine to enable immersive world synthesis through optimized semi-autoregressive decoding processes. This dedicated focus on world simulation distinctly sets it apart from systems engineered for high-concurrency scenarios (like vLLM or SGLang) and from classic video diffusion models (such as xDiTs). Inferix further enhances its offering with interactive video streaming and profiling, enabling real-time interaction and realistic simulation to accurately model world dynamics. Additionally, it supports efficient benchmarking through seamless integration of LV-Bench, a new fine-grained evaluation benchmark tailored for minute-long video generation scenarios. We hope the community will work together to advance Inferix and foster world model exploration.

### [5] [Video Object Recognition in Mobile Edge Networks: Local Tracking or Edge Detection?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20716)
*Kun Guo,Yun Shen,Xijun Wang,Chaoqun You,Yun Rui,Tony Q. S. Quek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LTED-Ada算法，在移动边缘计算环境中自适应选择本地跟踪或边缘检测，通过深度强化学习和联邦学习优化视频对象识别的帧率、准确率和延迟要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 资源受限设备（如交通摄像头）上的视频对象识别面临挑战，需要平衡计算密集型检测和轻量级跟踪，同时决定何时进行边缘检测或本地跟踪。

Method: 基于深度强化学习开发LTED-Ada算法，在单设备场景自适应选择跟踪/检测；在多设备场景使用联邦学习进行协作策略训练；通过硬件在环实验验证。

Result: 实验使用多个树莓派4B设备和PC作为边缘服务器，证明了LTED-Ada在帧率、准确率和延迟要求方面的优越性能。

Conclusion: LTED-Ada算法有效解决了移动边缘网络中视频对象识别的自适应决策问题，在单设备和多设备场景下均表现出色。

Abstract: Fast and accurate video object recognition, which relies on frame-by-frame video analytics, remains a challenge for resource-constrained devices such as traffic cameras. Recent advances in mobile edge computing have made it possible to offload computation-intensive object detection to edge servers equipped with high-accuracy neural networks, while lightweight and fast object tracking algorithms run locally on devices. This hybrid approach offers a promising solution but introduces a new challenge: deciding when to perform edge detection versus local tracking. To address this, we formulate two long-term optimization problems for both single-device and multi-device scenarios, taking into account the temporal correlation of consecutive frames and the dynamic conditions of mobile edge networks. Based on the formulation, we propose the LTED-Ada in single-device setting, a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm that adaptively selects between local tracking and edge detection, according to the frame rate as well as recognition accuracy and delay requirement. In multi-device setting, we further enhance LTED-Ada using federated learning to enable collaborative policy training across devices, thereby improving its generalization to unseen frame rates and performance requirements. Finally, we conduct extensive hardware-in-the-loop experiments using multiple Raspberry Pi 4B devices and a personal computer as the edge server, demonstrating the superiority of LTED-Ada.

### [6] [DeeAD: Dynamic Early Exit of Vision-Language Action for Efficient Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20720)
*Haibo HU,Lianming Huang,Nan Guan,Chun Jason Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeeAD是一个无需训练的早期退出框架，通过评估中间轨迹的物理可行性来加速视觉语言动作模型的推理，在保持规划质量的同时减少28%的延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言动作模型在自动驾驶中统一了感知、推理和轨迹生成，但由于深度transformer堆栈导致推理延迟显著。

Method: 提出基于动作引导的早期退出框架，当预测轨迹与轻量级规划先验（如导航或低精度规划）在可容忍偏差内对齐时终止推理，并引入多跳控制器自适应跳过冗余层。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试中实现高达28%的transformer层稀疏度和29%的延迟减少，同时保持规划质量和安全性。

Conclusion: DeeAD框架能够有效加速VLA规划推理，无需重新训练即可集成到现有模型中，在保持性能的同时显著提升效率。

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models unify perception, reasoning, and trajectory generation for autonomous driving, but suffer from significant inference latency due to deep transformer stacks. We present DeeAD, a training-free, action-guided early-exit framework that accelerates VLA planning by evaluating the physical feasibility of intermediate trajectories. Instead of relying on confidence scores, DeeAD terminates inference when predicted trajectories align with lightweight planning priors (e.g., Navigation or Low-precision Planning) within a tolerable deviation (<2m). To improve efficiency, we introduce a multi-hop controller that adaptively skips redundant layers based on the change rate of scores. DeeAD integrates into existing VLA models, such as ORION, without requiring retraining. Experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate up to 28% transformer-layer sparsity and 29% latency reduction, while preserving planning quality and safety.

### [7] [Foundry: Distilling 3D Foundation Models for the Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20721)
*Guillaume Letellier,Siddharth Srivastava,Frédéric Jurie,Gaurav Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Foundation Model Distillation (FMD)新范式，用于将大型自监督学习模型压缩为紧凑高效的代理模型，保持其通用表征能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型基础模型在边缘设备上部署困难，现有压缩技术会牺牲模型的通用性，需要一种既能压缩模型又能保持其通用表征能力的方法。

Method: 使用Foundry方法训练学生模型学习压缩的SuperTokens，重构教师模型的token级表征，捕获其潜在空间的紧凑基向量。

Result: 单个蒸馏模型在分类、部件分割和少样本场景等多种下游任务中保持强迁移性，接近完整基础模型性能，同时使用显著更少的token和FLOPs。

Conclusion: FMD范式成功压缩了大型SSL模型，使其更适合在资源受限的硬件上部署，同时保持了模型的通用表征能力。

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained with self-supervised learning (SSL) on large-scale datasets have become powerful general-purpose feature extractors. However, their immense size and computational cost make them prohibitive for deployment on edge devices such as robots and AR/VR headsets. Existing compression techniques like standard knowledge distillation create efficient 'specialist' models but sacrifice the crucial, downstream-agnostic generality that makes foundation models so valuable.  In this paper, we introduce Foundation Model Distillation (FMD), a new paradigm for compressing large SSL models into compact, efficient, and faithful proxies that retain their general-purpose representational power. We present Foundry, the first implementation of FMD for 3D point clouds. Our approach, Foundry, trains a student to learn a compressed set of SuperTokens that reconstruct the teacher's token-level representations, capturing a compact basis of its latent space. A single distilled model maintains strong transferability across diverse downstream tasks-classification, part segmentation, and few-shot scenarios-approaching full foundation-model performance while using significantly fewer tokens and FLOPs, making such models more practical for deployment on resourceconstrained hardware.

### [8] [DinoLizer: Learning from the Best for Generative Inpainting Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20722)
*Minh Thong Doi,Jan Butora,Vincent Itier,Jérémie Boulanger,Patrick Bas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DinoLizer是一个基于DINOv2的模型，用于定位生成式修复图像中的篡改区域，通过线性分类头和滑动窗口策略实现14×14补丁级别的篡改检测，在多个数据集上超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的局部篡改检测方法在生成式修复图像上表现不足，需要开发能够准确定位语义篡改区域的检测器。

Method: 在DINOv2预训练模型基础上添加线性分类头，使用滑动窗口策略处理大尺寸图像，通过后处理优化二进制篡改掩码。

Result: DinoLizer在多个修复数据集上超越最先进的局部篡改检测器，平均IoU比次优模型高12%，对常见后处理操作保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DinoLizer证明了Vision Transformers在篡改定位任务中的强大表示能力，DINOv2相比DINOv3在该任务上表现更优。

Abstract: We introduce DinoLizer, a DINOv2-based model for localizing manipulated regions in generative inpainting. Our method builds on a DINOv2 model pretrained to detect synthetic images on the B-Free dataset. We add a linear classification head on top of the Vision Transformer's patch embeddings to predict manipulations at a $14\times 14$ patch resolution. The head is trained to focus on semantically altered regions, treating non-semantic edits as part of the original content. Because the ViT accepts only fixed-size inputs, we use a sliding-window strategy to aggregate predictions over larger images; the resulting heatmaps are post-processed to refine the estimated binary manipulation masks. Empirical results show that DinoLizer surpasses state-of-the-art local manipulation detectors on a range of inpainting datasets derived from different generative models. It remains robust to common post-processing operations such as resizing, noise addition, and JPEG (double) compression. On average, DinoLizer achieves a 12\% higher Intersection-over-Union (IoU) than the next best model, with even greater gains after post-processing. Our experiments with off-the-shelf DINOv2 demonstrate the strong representational power of Vision Transformers for this task. Finally, extensive ablation studies comparing DINOv2 and its successor, DINOv3, in deepfake localization confirm DinoLizer's superiority. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

### [9] [CANVAS: A Benchmark for Vision-Language Models on Tool-Based User Interface Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20737)
*Daeheon Jeong,Seoyeon Byun,Kihoon Son,Dae Hyun Kim,Juho Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CANVAS是一个用于评估视觉语言模型在工具调用界面设计任务中性能的基准测试，包含598个基于工具的设计任务，覆盖30个功能类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏评估视觉语言模型在工具调用界面设计能力的基准测试，而理解这种能力对于模型与设计师在常规软件中协作具有重要意义。

Method: 创建CANVAS基准测试，包含两种任务类型：设计复制（复制整个UI界面）和设计修改（修改现有界面的特定部分），模型通过上下文工具调用来逐步更新设计。

Result: 领先模型展现出更具策略性的工具调用，提高了设计质量，同时识别出模型的常见错误模式。

Conclusion: CANVAS基准测试填补了工具调用界面设计评估的空白，为未来增强基于工具的设计能力提供了指导。

Abstract: User interface (UI) design is an iterative process in which designers progressively refine their work with design software such as Figma or Sketch. Recent advances in vision language models (VLMs) with tool invocation suggest these models can operate design software to edit a UI design through iteration. Understanding and enhancing this capacity is important, as it highlights VLMs' potential to collaborate with designers within conventional software. However, as no existing benchmark evaluates tool-based design performance, the capacity remains unknown. To address this, we introduce CANVAS, a benchmark for VLMs on tool-based user interface design. Our benchmark contains 598 tool-based design tasks paired with ground-truth references sampled from 3.3K mobile UI designs across 30 function-based categories (e.g., onboarding, messaging). In each task, a VLM updates the design step-by-step through context-based tool invocations (e.g., create a rectangle as a button background), linked to design software. Specifically, CANVAS incorporates two task types: (i) design replication evaluates the ability to reproduce a whole UI screen; (ii) design modification evaluates the ability to modify a specific part of an existing screen. Results suggest that leading models exhibit more strategic tool invocations, improving design quality. Furthermore, we identify common error patterns models exhibit, guiding future work in enhancing tool-based design capabilities.

*Raghuveer Thirukovalluru,Xiaochuang Han,Bhuwan Dhingra,Emily Dinan,Maha Elbayad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出文本引导语义图像编码器(TIE)，通过文本查询条件化生成图像表示，在多个图像到文本基准测试中显著提升性能，同时减少图像tokens数量提高推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉语言模型中的图像编码器通常独立预训练，无法根据下游任务或文本查询进行自适应处理，导致处理图像时缺乏针对性。

Method: 开发文本引导语义图像编码器(TIE)，使图像表示生成过程能够基于输入文本查询进行条件化处理。

Result: 在1B和3B规模下，TIE模型在9个图像到文本基准测试中平均提升1.5和1.3分，DocVQA和InfoVQA任务上提升高达6分，同时仅使用一半图像tokens实现更高效推理。

Conclusion: 文本条件化训练能有效优化编码器捕捉关键视觉特征，TIE始终关注查询相关区域，增强了可解释性和查询特定基础。

Abstract: Image encoders, a fundamental component of vision-language models (VLMs), are typically pretrained independently before being aligned with a language model. This standard paradigm results in encoders that process images agnostically, without regard to the specific downstream task or text query. To address this limitation, we propose the Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder (TIE), which generates image representations conditioned on the input text query. VLMs equipped with TIE outperform their conventional counterparts by +1.5 and +1.3 points on average across nine image-to-text benchmarks at the 1B and 3B scales, respectively, with gains reaching up to 6 points on tasks such as DocVQA and InfoVQA. Moreover, TIE-based VLMs attain superior performance while utilizing only half as many image tiles (tokens), resulting in notably improved inference efficiency. TIE also generalizes well with generic queries, indicating that text-conditioned training effectively optimizes the encoder to capture key visual features. Qualitative analysis confirms that TIE consistently attends to query-relevant regions, enhancing both interpretability and query-specific grounding.

TL;DR: SMARC是一个从最小视觉输入进行表面材料重建和分类的统一模型，仅需10%图像补丁即可重建完整RGB表面并分类材料类别，在稀疏观测下实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖密集或全场景观测，在受限或部分视图环境中效果有限，需要解决从稀疏视觉线索理解材料表面的挑战。

Method: 结合部分卷积U-Net和分类头的架构，在极端观测稀疏度下同时实现空间修复和语义理解，使用Touch and Go真实世界表面纹理数据集。

Result: 与5个模型对比，SMARC达到PSNR 17.55 dB和材料分类准确率85.10%的最先进结果。

Conclusion: 部分卷积在缺失数据下的空间推理具有优势，为最小视觉表面理解奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Understanding material surfaces from sparse visual cues is critical for applications in robotics, simulation, and material perception. However, most existing methods rely on dense or full-scene observations, limiting their effectiveness in constrained or partial view environment. To address this challenge, we introduce SMARC, a unified model for Surface MAterial Reconstruction and Classification from minimal visual input. By giving only a single 10% contiguous patch of the image, SMARC recognizes and reconstructs the full RGB surface while simultaneously classifying the material category. Our architecture combines a Partial Convolutional U-Net with a classification head, enabling both spatial inpainting and semantic understanding under extreme observation sparsity. We compared SMARC against five models including convolutional autoencoders [17], Vision Transformer (ViT) [13], Masked Autoencoder (MAE) [5], Swin Transformer [9], and DETR [2] using Touch and Go dataset [16] of real-world surface textures. SMARC achieves state-of-the-art results with a PSNR of 17.55 dB and a material classification accuracy of 85.10%. Our findings highlight the advantages of partial convolution in spatial reasoning under missing data and establish a strong foundation for minimal-vision surface understanding.

TL;DR: LongVT是一个端到端的代理框架，通过交错的多模态工具链思维实现长视频推理，利用LMMs的时序定位能力作为原生视频裁剪工具进行全局到局部的推理循环。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在处理长视频时容易产生幻觉，因为证据稀疏且时间分散。受人类理解长视频的方式启发（先全局浏览再检查相关片段细节），需要开发能够进行细粒度推理的框架。

Method: 利用LMMs固有的时序定位能力作为视频裁剪工具，放大特定视频片段并重新采样更细粒度的视频帧，形成全局到局部的推理循环。采用三阶段训练策略：工具集成的冷启动监督微调、代理强化学习和代理强化微调。

Result: LongVT在四个具有挑战性的长视频理解和推理基准测试中持续优于现有强基线模型。发布了包含247.9K训练样本和1,280个QA对的评估基准VideoSIAH数据集。

Conclusion: LongVT框架通过多模态工具链思维有效解决了长视频推理中的幻觉问题，展示了在长视频理解和推理任务上的优越性能。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown great potential for video reasoning with textual Chain-of-Thought. However, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, especially when processing long-form videos where evidence is sparse and temporally dispersed. Inspired by how humans comprehend long videos - by first skimming globally and then examining relevant clips for details - we introduce LongVT, an end-to-end agentic framework that enables "Thinking with Long Videos" via interleaved Multimodal Chain-of-Tool-Thought. Specifically, we exploit LMMs' inherent temporal grounding ability as a native video cropping tool to zoom in on a specific video clip and resample finer-grained video frames. This global-to-local reasoning loop continues until answers are grounded in retrieved visual evidence. Given the scarcity of fine-grained question-answering (QA) data for the long video reasoning task, we curate and will release a data suite named VideoSIAH to facilitate both training and evaluation. Specifically, our training dataset consists of 247.9K samples for tool-integrated cold-start supervised fine-tuning, 1.6K samples for agentic reinforcement learning, and 15.4K samples for agentic reinforcement fine-tuning, respectively. Our evaluation benchmark consists of 1,280 QA pairs that are carefully curated through a semi-automatic data pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation. With a meticulously designed three-stage training strategy and extensive empirical validation, LongVT consistently outperforms existing strong baselines across four challenging long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks. Our codes, data, and model checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/LongVT .

*Souradeep Dutta,Keshav Bulia,Neena S Nair*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文对KRISP模型进行了轻量级复现，显著减少了参数数量，揭示了原模型的设计缺陷和实际问题，并在资源受限条件下评估了知识增强VQA架构的可扩展性和有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原KRISP模型虽然有效，但需要工业级训练规模，计算需求高且与大型骨干网络紧密耦合。本文旨在重新审视KRISP，提供参数更少的轻量级版本。

Method: 通过系统消融研究进行轻量级复现，包括在合成VQA数据上的概念验证和在DAQUAR数据集上的评估。模型采用低参数配置，并受外部知识图谱领域约束。

Result: 复现模型性能约为原模型的75%，但揭示了原论文未充分涵盖的设计缺陷、现实陷阱和隐性问题。模型能防止AI幻觉，仅在特定知识领域内生成输出。

Conclusion: 轻量级模型参数极少，可在智能手机和AR-VR等边缘设备上运行，进一步改善了离线视觉推理能力。

Abstract: Facebook AI Research introduced KRISP [4], which integrates structured external knowledge into pipelines for vision-language reasoning. Despite its effectiveness, the original model has been developed for industrial-scale training, is computationally demanding, and is tightly connected to a large backbone. In this work, we reexamine KRISP from a different angle and offer a lightweight reproduction with significantly fewer parameters. Even though our replicated model performs about 75 % of the original, the replication process uncovers a number of design flaws, real-world pitfalls, and implicit problems that were not fully covered in the original paper. We offer insights into the scalability and efficacy of knowledge-enhanced VQA architectures under resource constraints through systematic ablation studies, which include a proof-of-concept on synthetic VQA data and evaluation on the DAQUAR dataset. Our model, configured with a low parameter setup and constrained by the external Knowledge graph domain, prevents AI hallucinations and generates outputs solely within that domain. Minimal parameters allow us to function on edge devices like smartphones and AR-VR, further improving offline visual reasoning.

Abstract: Dynamic sampling mechanisms in deep learning architectures have demonstrated utility across many computer vision models, though the theoretical analysis of these structures has not yet been unified. In this paper we connect the various dynamic sampling methods by developing and analyzing a novel operator which generalizes existing methods, which we term "warping". Warping provides a minimal implementation of dynamic sampling which is amenable to analysis, and can be used to reconstruct existing architectures including deformable convolutions, active convolutional units, and spatial transformer networks. Using our formalism, we provide statistical analysis of the operator by modeling the inputs as both IID variables and homogeneous random fields. Extending this analysis, we discover a unique asymmetry between the forward and backward pass of the model training. We demonstrate that these mechanisms represent an entirely different class of orthogonal operators to the traditional translationally invariant operators defined by convolutions. With a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical investigation, we find the conditions necessary to ensure stable training of dynamic sampling networks. In addition, statistical analysis of discretization effects are studied. Finally, we introduce a novel loss landscape visualization which utilizes gradient update information directly, to better understand learning behavior.

TL;DR: Δ-NeRF是一个用于增量式NeRF优化的模块化残差框架，通过残差控制器、不确定性感知门控机制和视图选择策略，实现在不访问历史数据的情况下优化NeRF模型，显著减少训练时间和数据需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NeRF框架在引入新视图时需要完全重新训练，限制了在卫星地形分析等数据顺序到达场景中的应用。增量式NeRF优化研究不足，简单方法存在灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 提出Δ-NeRF框架，包含：(1)残差控制器向冻结的基础NeRF注入逐层修正；(2)不确定性感知门控机制自适应结合基础和优化预测；(3)视图选择策略减少训练数据；(4)使用知识蒸馏将增强模型压缩为紧凑学生网络。

Result: 在卫星图像上，Δ-NeRF性能与联合训练相当，训练时间减少30-42%，数据需求减少47%。PSNR比简单微调提升43.5%，在某些指标上超越联合训练。

Conclusion: Δ-NeRF为增量式NeRF优化提供了有效解决方案，解决了灾难性遗忘问题，显著提升了训练效率和模型压缩能力。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, most existing NeRF frameworks require complete retraining when new views are introduced incrementally, limiting their applicability in domains where data arrives sequentially. This limitation is particularly problematic in satellite-based terrain analysis, where regions are repeatedly observed over time. Incremental refinement of NeRFs remains underexplored, and naive approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting when past data is unavailable. We propose $Δ$-NeRF, a unique modular residual framework for incremental NeRF refinement. $Δ$-NeRF introduces several novel techniques including: (1) a residual controller that injects per-layer corrections into a frozen base NeRF, enabling refinement without access to past data; (2) an uncertainty-aware gating mechanism that prevents overcorrection by adaptively combining base and refined predictions; and (3) a view selection strategy that reduces training data by up to 47\% while maintaining performance. Additionally, we employ knowledge distillation to compress the enhanced model into a compact student network (20\% of original size). Experiments on satellite imagery demonstrate that $Δ$-NeRF achieves performance comparable to joint training while reducing training time by 30-42\%. $Δ$-NeRF consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving an improvement of up to 43.5\% in PSNR over naive fine-tuning and surpassing joint training on some metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Split-then-Merge (StM) 是一个新颖的生成视频合成框架，通过将未标注视频分割为动态前景和背景层，然后自组合学习动态主体与多样化场景的交互，解决控制生成和数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖标注数据集或手工规则，存在数据稀缺问题。StM旨在增强生成视频合成的控制能力，同时解决数据稀缺问题。

Method: 将未标注视频分割为动态前景和背景层，通过自组合学习主体与场景的交互。采用变换感知训练管道，使用多层融合和增强实现affordance-aware合成，结合身份保持损失保持前景保真度。

Result: 实验表明StM在定量基准测试和人类/VLLM定性评估中均优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: StM框架通过分割-合并策略有效学习复杂组合动态，实现了更真实的视频生成，解决了数据稀缺和控制问题。

Abstract: We present Split-then-Merge (StM), a novel framework designed to enhance control in generative video composition and address its data scarcity problem. Unlike conventional methods relying on annotated datasets or handcrafted rules, StM splits a large corpus of unlabeled videos into dynamic foreground and background layers, then self-composes them to learn how dynamic subjects interact with diverse scenes. This process enables the model to learn the complex compositional dynamics required for realistic video generation. StM introduces a novel transformation-aware training pipeline that utilizes a multi-layer fusion and augmentation to achieve affordance-aware composition, alongside an identity-preservation loss that maintains foreground fidelity during blending. Experiments show StM outperforms SoTA methods in both quantitative benchmarks and in humans/VLLM-based qualitative evaluations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sphinx是一个针对视觉感知和推理核心认知原语的合成环境，通过程序化生成包含图案、图块、图表、图标和几何基元的谜题，并提供可验证的真实解，支持精确评估和大规模数据集构建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型在视觉推理任务上表现不佳，需要更精确的评估方法和训练策略来提升多模态推理能力。

Method: 开发Sphinx合成环境，生成25种任务类型的谜题，使用强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR）来训练模型。

Result: 评估显示最先进的GPT-5模型准确率仅为51.1%，远低于人类水平；RLVR方法显著提升了模型在这些任务上的准确性，并在外部视觉推理基准上获得改进。

Conclusion: Sphinx为视觉推理提供了精确的评估基准，RLVR方法展示了提升多模态推理能力的潜力。

Abstract: We present Sphinx, a synthetic environment for visual perception and reasoning that targets core cognitive primitives. Sphinx procedurally generates puzzles using motifs, tiles, charts, icons, and geometric primitives, each paired with verifiable ground-truth solutions, enabling both precise evaluation and large-scale dataset construction. The benchmark covers 25 task types spanning symmetry detection, geometric transformations, spatial reasoning, chart interpretation, and sequence prediction. Evaluating recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) shows that even state-of-the-art GPT-5 attains only 51.1% accuracy, well below human performance. Finally, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) substantially improves model accuracy on these tasks and yields gains on external visual reasoning benchmarks, highlighting its promise for advancing multimodal reasoning.

Result: 在Kandinsky 2.2上的实验表明OVI可替代传统先验，同时发现当前评估基准存在缺陷，约束OVI方法在视觉保真度上优于基线，最近邻方法表现最佳。

Conclusion: 优化视觉反演方法有望替代传统先验网络，值得进一步研究，同时揭示了现有评估基准的局限性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have established the state-of-the-art in text-to-image generation, but their performance often relies on a diffusion prior network to translate text embeddings into the visual manifold for easier decoding. These priors are computationally expensive and require extensive training on massive datasets. In this work, we challenge the necessity of a trained prior at all by employing Optimization-based Visual Inversion (OVI), a training-free and data-free alternative, to replace the need for a prior. OVI initializes a latent visual representation from random pseudo-tokens and iteratively optimizes it to maximize the cosine similarity with input textual prompt embedding. We further propose two novel constraints, a Mahalanobis-based and a Nearest-Neighbor loss, to regularize the OVI optimization process toward the distribution of realistic images. Our experiments, conducted on Kandinsky 2.2, show that OVI can serve as an alternative to traditional priors. More importantly, our analysis reveals a critical flaw in current evaluation benchmarks like T2I-CompBench++, where simply using the text embedding as a prior achieves surprisingly high scores, despite lower perceptual quality. Our constrained OVI methods improve visual fidelity over this baseline, with the Nearest-Neighbor approach proving particularly effective, achieving quantitative scores comparable to or higher than the state-of-the-art data-efficient prior, indicating that the idea merits further investigation. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RefTr是一个用于血管树中心线生成的3D图像到图模型，通过循环精炼汇合轨迹来生成具有正确树状拓扑的中心线图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在临床诊断、治疗规划和手术导航中，准确检测血管树的中心线并保持正确的树状拓扑至关重要。高召回率尤其重要，因为遗漏小分支可能导致致命错误。

Method: 采用Producer-Refiner架构，基于Transformer解码器。Producer提出初始汇合轨迹，Refiner循环精炼这些轨迹形成最终中心线图。引入高效的非极大值抑制算法合并重复分支。

Result: 在多个公共中心线数据集上，RefTr实现了优于先前SOTA的召回率和相当的精确度，同时推理速度更快、参数数量大幅减少（解码器参数减少2.4倍）。

Conclusion: RefTr展示了作为3D医学成像中血管树分析的新SOTA框架的潜力，在保持高召回率的同时提供更高效的性能。

Abstract: Tubular trees, such as blood vessels and lung airways, are essential for material transport within the human body. Accurately detecting their centerlines with correct tree topology is critical for clinical tasks such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical navigation. In these applications, maintaining high recall is crucial, as missing small branches can result in fatal mistakes caused by incomplete assessments or undetected abnormalities. We present RefTr, a 3D image-to-graph model for centerline generation of vascular trees via recurrent refinement of confluent trajectories. RefTr uses a Producer-Refiner architecture based on a Transformer decoder, where the Producer proposes a set of initial confluent trajectories that are recurrently refined by the Refiner to produce final trajectories, which forms the centerline graph. The confluent trajectory representation enables refinement of complete trajectories while explicitly enforcing a valid tree topology. The recurrent refinement scheme improves precision and reuses the same Refiner block across multiple steps, yielding a 2.4x reduction in decoder parameters compared to previous SOTA. We also introduce an efficient non-maximum suppression algorithm for spatial tree graphs to merge duplicate branches and boost precision. Across multiple public centerline datasets, RefTr achieves superior recall and comparable precision to previous SOTA, while offering faster inference and substantially fewer parameters, demonstrating its potential as a new state-of-the-art framework for vascular tree analysis in 3D medical imaging.

Abstract: Reliable depth estimation under real optical conditions remains a core challenge for camera vision in systems such as autonomous robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent progress in depth estimation and depth-of-field rendering, research remains constrained by the lack of large-scale, high-fidelity, real stereo DSLR datasets, limiting real-world generalization and evaluation of models trained on synthetic data as shown extensively in literature. We present the first high-resolution (5472$\times$3648px) stereo DSLR dataset with 18000 images, systematically varying focal length and aperture across complex real scenes and capturing the optical realism and complexity of professional camera systems. For 9 scenes with varying scene complexity, lighting and background, images are captured with two identical camera assemblies at 10 focal lengths (28-70mm) and 5 apertures (f/2.8-f/22), spanning 50 optical configurations in 2000 images per scene. This full-range optics coverage enables controlled analysis of geometric and optical effects for monocular and stereo depth estimation, shallow depth-of-field rendering, deblurring, 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Each focal configuration has a dedicated calibration image set, supporting evaluation of classical and learning based methods for intrinsic and extrinsic calibration. The dataset features challenging visual elements such as multi-scale optical illusions, reflective surfaces, mirrors, transparent glass walls, fine-grained details, and natural / artificial ambient light variations. This work attempts to bridge the realism gap between synthetic training data and real camera optics, and demonstrates challenges with the current state-of-the-art monocular, stereo depth and depth-of-field methods. We release the dataset, calibration files, and evaluation code to support reproducible research on real-world optical generalization.

Abstract: Visual content memorability has intrigued the scientific community for decades, with applications ranging widely, from understanding nuanced aspects of human memory to enhancing content design. A significant challenge in progressing the field lies in the expensive process of collecting memorability annotations from humans. This limits the diversity and scalability of datasets for modeling visual content memorability. Most existing datasets are limited to collecting aggregate memorability scores for visual content, not capturing the nuanced memorability signals present in natural, open-ended recall descriptions. In this work, we introduce the first large-scale unsupervised dataset designed explicitly for modeling visual memorability signals, containing over 82,000 videos, accompanied by descriptive recall data. We leverage tip-of-the-tongue (ToT) retrieval queries from online platforms such as Reddit. We demonstrate that our unsupervised dataset provides rich signals for two memorability-related tasks: recall generation and ToT retrieval. Large vision-language models fine-tuned on our dataset outperform state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o in generating open-ended memorability descriptions for visual content. We also employ a contrastive training strategy to create the first model capable of performing multimodal ToT retrieval. Our dataset and models present a novel direction, facilitating progress in visual content memorability research.

Abstract: We propose a method which, given a sequence of stereo foggy images, estimates the parameters of a fog model and updates them dynamically. In contrast with previous approaches, which estimate the parameters sequentially and thus are prone to error propagation, our algorithm estimates all the parameters simultaneously by solving a novel optimisation problem. By assuming that fog is only locally homogeneous, our method effectively handles real-world fog, which is often globally inhomogeneous. The proposed algorithm can be easily used as an add-on module in existing visual Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) or odometry systems in the presence of fog. In order to assess our method, we also created a new dataset, the Stereo Driving In Real Fog (SDIRF), consisting of high-quality, consecutive stereo frames of real, foggy road scenes under a variety of visibility conditions, totalling over 40 minutes and 34k frames. As a first-of-its-kind, SDIRF contains the camera's photometric parameters calibrated in a lab environment, which is a prerequisite for correctly applying the atmospheric scattering model to foggy images. The dataset also includes the counterpart clear data of the same routes recorded in overcast weather, which is useful for companion work in image defogging and depth reconstruction. We conducted extensive experiments using both synthetic foggy data and real foggy sequences from SDIRF to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over prior methods. Our method not only produces the most accurate estimates on synthetic data, but also adapts better to real fog. We make our code and SDIRF publicly available\footnote{https://github.com/SenseRoboticsLab/estimating-fog-parameters} to the community with the aim of advancing the research on visual perception in fog.

TL;DR: V^2-SAM是一个统一的跨视角物体对应框架，通过两个互补的提示生成器将SAM2从单视角分割扩展到跨视角对应任务，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨视角物体对应任务（如ego-exo物体对应）由于视角和外观的剧烈变化，使得现有分割模型如SAM2难以直接应用，需要专门解决方案。

Method: 提出两个互补的提示生成器：V^2-Anchor基于DINOv3特征建立几何感知对应关系，V^2-Visual通过视觉提示匹配器增强外观引导线索；采用多专家设计和后验循环一致性选择器自适应选择最可靠的专家。

Result: 在Ego-Exo4D、DAVIS-2017和HANDAL-X三个基准测试中均达到了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: V^2-SAM有效解决了跨视角物体对应问题，通过几何和外观线索的互补结合实现了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Cross-view object correspondence, exemplified by the representative task of ego-exo object correspondence, aims to establish consistent associations of the same object across different viewpoints (e.g., ego-centric and exo-centric). This task poses significant challenges due to drastic viewpoint and appearance variations, making existing segmentation models, such as SAM2, non-trivial to apply directly. To address this, we present V^2-SAM, a unified cross-view object correspondence framework that adapts SAM2 from single-view segmentation to cross-view correspondence through two complementary prompt generators. Specifically, the Cross-View Anchor Prompt Generator (V^2-Anchor), built upon DINOv3 features, establishes geometry-aware correspondences and, for the first time, unlocks coordinate-based prompting for SAM2 in cross-view scenarios, while the Cross-View Visual Prompt Generator (V^2-Visual) enhances appearance-guided cues via a novel visual prompt matcher that aligns ego-exo representations from both feature and structural perspectives. To effectively exploit the strengths of both prompts, we further adopt a multi-expert design and introduce a Post-hoc Cyclic Consistency Selector (PCCS) that adaptively selects the most reliable expert based on cyclic consistency. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of V^2-SAM, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on Ego-Exo4D (ego-exo object correspondence), DAVIS-2017 (video object tracking), and HANDAL-X (robotic-ready cross-view correspondence).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Null-Text Test-Time Alignment (Null-TTA)方法，通过优化分类器自由引导中的无条件嵌入来对齐扩散模型，避免奖励黑客问题，在目标测试时对齐和跨奖励泛化方面达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时对齐方法容易导致奖励优化不足或过度优化（奖励黑客），需要一种在语义相干流形上进行对齐的方法。

Method: 优化分类器自由引导中的无条件嵌入，而不是操作潜在变量或噪声变量，确保对齐发生在语义相干流形上。

Result: Null-TTA在目标测试时对齐方面达到最先进水平，同时保持强大的跨奖励泛化能力。

Conclusion: 语义空间优化是测试时对齐的有效且有原则的新范式。

Abstract: Test-time alignment (TTA) aims to adapt models to specific rewards during inference. However, existing methods tend to either under-optimise or over-optimise (reward hack) the target reward function. We propose Null-Text Test-Time Alignment (Null-TTA), which aligns diffusion models by optimising the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance, rather than manipulating latent or noise variables. Due to the structured semantic nature of the text embedding space, this ensures alignment occurs on a semantically coherent manifold and prevents reward hacking (exploiting non-semantic noise patterns to improve the reward). Since the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance serves as the anchor for the model's generative distribution, Null-TTA directly steers model's generative distribution towards the target reward rather than just adjusting the samples, even without updating model parameters. Thanks to these desirable properties, we show that Null-TTA achieves state-of-the-art target test-time alignment while maintaining strong cross-reward generalisation. This establishes semantic-space optimisation as an effective and principled novel paradigm for TTA.

Motivation: 传统隐式神经表示缺乏显式几何结构，局部编辑能力有限，难以与物理模拟集成，限制了在动态或交互场景中的应用。

Method: 将可训练高斯分布与基于神经网络的INR结合，对给定图像坐标检索K个最近高斯分布，聚合距离加权的嵌入，通过神经网络预测RGB值。

Result: 实现了连续图像表示、可解释几何结构和灵活的局部编辑能力，为物理感知和交互式图像操作提供了基础。

Conclusion: GaINeR框架克服了传统INR的局限性，在保持高质量重建的同时，增强了几何结构表示和编辑能力。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have become an essential tool for modeling continuous 2D images, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction, super-resolution, and compression. Popular architectures such as SIREN, WIRE, and FINER demonstrate the potential of INR for capturing fine-grained image details. However, traditional INRs often lack explicit geometric structure and have limited capabilities for local editing or integration with physical simulation, restricting their applicability in dynamic or interactive settings. To address these limitations, we propose GaINeR: Geometry-Aware Implicit Network Representation, a novel framework for 2D images that combines trainable Gaussian distributions with a neural network-based INR. For a given image coordinate, the model retrieves the K nearest Gaussians, aggregates distance-weighted embeddings, and predicts the RGB value via a neural network. This design enables continuous image representation, interpretable geometric structure, and flexible local editing, providing a foundation for physically aware and interactive image manipulation. The official implementation of our method is publicly available at https://github.com/WJakubowska/GaINeR.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种深度学习模型，用于降低小脑桥脑角MRI对比剂剂量，通过训练模型从低剂量模拟图像恢复标准剂量图像质量，在10%-30%剂量下仍能保持良好诊断效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少MRI检查中对比剂的使用剂量，降低患者风险和成本，同时保持图像质量和诊断准确性。

Method: 多中心回顾性研究，使用前庭神经鞘瘤患者的T1和T1ce MRI数据模拟低剂量图像，训练深度学习模型从低剂量图像恢复标准剂量图像质量。

Result: 在10%输入剂量下，DL恢复的T1ce图像结构相似性指数从0.639提高到0.993，峰值信噪比从21.6dB提高到41.4dB，分割性能显著改善（Dice从0.673提高到0.734）。

Conclusion: 深度学习模型显著改善了小脑桥脑角低剂量MRI的图像质量，使得在仅使用10%-30%标准剂量的情况下仍能实现病变检测和诊断特征分析。

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate a deep learning (DL) model for reducing the agent dose of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI (T1ce) of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) cistern. Materials and methods: In this multi-center retrospective study, T1 and T1ce of vestibular schwannoma (VS) patients were used to simulate low-dose T1ce with varying reductions of contrast agent dose. DL models were trained to restore standard-dose T1ce from the low-dose simulation. The image quality and segmentation performance of the DL-restored T1ce were evaluated. A head and neck radiologist was asked to rate DL-restored images in multiple aspects, including image quality and diagnostic characterization. Results: 203 MRI studies from 72 VS patients (mean age, 58.51 \pm 14.73, 39 men) were evaluated. As the input dose increased, the structural similarity index measure of the restored T1ce increased from 0.639 \pm 0.113 to 0.993 \pm 0.009, and the peak signal-to-noise ratio increased from 21.6 \pm 3.73 dB to 41.4 \pm 4.84 dB. At 10% input dose, using DL-restored T1ce for segmentation improved the Dice from 0.673 to 0.734, the 95% Hausdorff distance from 2.38 mm to 2.07 mm, and the average surface distance from 1.00 mm to 0.59 mm. Both DL-restored T1ce from 10% and 30% input doses showed excellent images, with the latter being considered more informative.

Conclusion: 提出的平滑正则化技术有效提升了轻量级视频识别模型的性能，通过强制时间平滑性使模型更好地捕捉视频的时序动态，在多个基准测试中显著超越现有方法

Abstract: We propose a smooth regularization technique that instills a strong temporal inductive bias in video recognition models, particularly benefiting lightweight architectures. Our method encourages smoothness in the intermediate-layer embeddings of consecutive frames by modeling their changes as a Gaussian Random Walk (GRW). This penalizes abrupt representational shifts, thereby promoting low-acceleration solutions that better align with the natural temporal coherence inherent in videos. By leveraging this enforced smoothness, lightweight models can more effectively capture complex temporal dynamics. Applied to such models, our technique yields a 3.8% to 6.4% accuracy improvement on Kinetics-600. Notably, the MoViNets model family trained with our smooth regularization improves the current state of the art by 3.8% to 6.1% within their respective FLOP constraints, while MobileNetV3 and the MoViNets-Stream family achieve gains of 4.9% to 6.4% over prior state-of-the-art models with comparable memory footprints.

Abstract: Neurons are the fundamental building blocks of deep neural networks, and their interconnections allow AI to achieve unprecedented results. Motivated by the goal of understanding how neurons encode information, compositional explanations leverage logical relationships between concepts to express the spatial alignment between neuron activations and human knowledge. However, these explanations rely on human-annotated datasets, restricting their applicability to specific domains and predefined concepts. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a framework for the vision domain that allows users to probe neurons for arbitrary concepts and datasets. Specifically, the framework leverages masks generated by open vocabulary semantic segmentation to compute open vocabulary compositional explanations. The proposed framework consists of three steps: specifying arbitrary concepts, generating semantic segmentation masks using open vocabulary models, and deriving compositional explanations from these masks. The paper compares the proposed framework with previous methods for computing compositional explanations both in terms of quantitative metrics and human interpretability, analyzes the differences in explanations when shifting from human-annotated data to model-annotated data, and showcases the additional capabilities provided by the framework in terms of flexibility of the explanations with respect to the tasks and properties of interest.

Conclusion: UruDendro4数据集填补了木材横截面数据的空白，支持基于横截面图像的年度木材体积建模，为自动年轮检测提供了有价值的基准和训练资源。

Abstract: Tree-ring growth represents the annual wood increment for a tree, and quantifying it allows researchers to assess which silvicultural practices are best suited for each species. Manual measurement of this growth is time-consuming and often imprecise, as it is typically performed along 4 to 8 radial directions on a cross-sectional disc. In recent years, automated algorithms and datasets have emerged to enhance accuracy and automate the delineation of annual rings in cross-sectional images.
  To address the scarcity of wood cross-section data, we introduce the UruDendro4 dataset, a collection of 102 image samples of Pinus taeda L., each manually annotated with annual growth rings. Unlike existing public datasets, UruDendro4 includes samples extracted at multiple heights along the stem, allowing for the volumetric modeling of annual growth using manually delineated rings. This dataset (images and annotations) allows the development of volumetric models for annual wood estimation based on cross-sectional imagery.
  Additionally, we provide a performance baseline for automatic ring detection on this dataset using state-of-the-art methods. The highest performance was achieved by the DeepCS-TRD method, with a mean Average Precision of 0.838, a mean Average Recall of 0.782, and an Adapted Rand Error score of 0.084. A series of ablation experiments were conducted to empirically validate the final parameter configuration. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that training a learning model including this dataset improves the model's generalization in the tree-ring detection task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺超声报告生成面临配对数据缺乏和大语言模型幻觉风险的问题，需要一种不依赖配对数据的方法来生成准确可靠的报告。

Method: 使用多任务Swin编码器学习描述符感知的视觉表示，通过双级目标（词元级交叉熵和余弦相似度对齐损失）对齐视觉和文本词元，从结构化描述符构建报告。

Result: 在两个公共乳腺超声数据集上，BUSTR在标准自然语言生成指标和临床效果指标上均有提升，特别是在BI-RADS类别和病理学等关键目标上表现优异。

Conclusion: 描述符感知的视觉模型结合词元级和对齐损失训练，无需配对图像-报告数据即可改善自动报告指标和临床效果。

Abstract: Automated radiology report generation (RRG) for breast ultrasound (BUS) is limited by the lack of paired image-report datasets and the risk of hallucinations from large language models. We propose BUSTR, a multitask vision-language framework that generates BUS reports without requiring paired image-report supervision. BUSTR constructs reports from structured descriptors (e.g., BI-RADS, pathology, histology) and radiomics features, learns descriptor-aware visual representations with a multi-head Swin encoder trained using a multitask loss over dataset-specific descriptor sets, and aligns visual and textual tokens via a dual-level objective that combines token-level cross-entropy with a cosine-similarity alignment loss between input and output representations. We evaluate BUSTR on two public BUS datasets, BrEaST and BUS-BRA, which differ in size and available descriptors. Across both datasets, BUSTR consistently improves standard natural language generation metrics and clinical efficacy metrics, particularly for key targets such as BI-RADS category and pathology. Our results show that this descriptor-aware vision model, trained with a combined token-level and alignment loss, improves both automatic report metrics and clinical efficacy without requiring paired image-report data.

TL;DR: 本文提出了表达性图像合成任务，通过StickerNet两阶段框架学习真实用户编辑行为，强调表达性和用户意图而非真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像合成研究关注视觉真实性和语义合理性，但现代内容创作中用户更倾向于创作艺术性、趣味性或社交参与性的内容，而非保持真实性。

Method: 提出StickerNet两阶段框架：首先确定合成类型，然后预测不透明度、遮罩、位置和缩放等放置参数。基于在线编辑平台收集的180万次编辑行为构建数据集。

Result: 用户研究和定量评估显示，StickerNet优于常见基线方法，并与人类放置行为高度匹配，证明了从真实世界编辑模式中学习的有效性。

Conclusion: 这项工作引入了视觉理解的新方向，强调表达性和用户意图而非真实性，为在线创意平台的内容创作提供了新的研究视角。

Abstract: As a widely used operation in image editing workflows, image composition has traditionally been studied with a focus on achieving visual realism and semantic plausibility. However, in practical editing scenarios of the modern content creation landscape, many compositions are not intended to preserve realism. Instead, users of online platforms motivated by gaining community recognition often aim to create content that is more artistic, playful, or socially engaging. Taking inspiration from this observation, we define the expressive composition task, a new formulation of image composition that embraces stylistic diversity and looser placement logic, reflecting how users edit images on real-world creative platforms. To address this underexplored problem, we present StickerNet, a two-stage framework that first determines the composition type, then predicts placement parameters such as opacity, mask, location, and scale accordingly. Unlike prior work that constructs datasets by simulating object placements on real images, we directly build our dataset from 1.8 million editing actions collected on an anonymous online visual creation and editing platform, each reflecting user-community validated placement decisions. This grounding in authentic editing behavior ensures strong alignment between task definition and training supervision. User studies and quantitative evaluations show that StickerNet outperforms common baselines and closely matches human placement behavior, demonstrating the effectiveness of learning from real-world editing patterns despite the inherent ambiguity of the task. This work introduces a new direction in visual understanding that emphasizes expressiveness and user intent over realism.

Motivation: 多摄像头交通视频分析面临大量数据处理挑战，传统方法使用VLM将视频转为文本耗时较长，无法及时生成洞察和调查事件。

Method: 采用顺序处理方式，利用摄像头重叠区域，迭代应用不同token限制的VLM，将前一个摄像头的输出作为后续摄像头的提示，并通过对象级相似性检测器智能跳过冗余VLM调用。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，TrafficLens将视频转文本时间减少高达4倍，同时保持信息准确性。

Conclusion: TrafficLens通过优化多摄像头交通视频分析流程，显著提高了处理效率，为智能交通系统提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Traffic cameras are essential in urban areas, playing a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. Multiple cameras at intersections enhance law enforcement capabilities, traffic management, and pedestrian safety. However, efficiently managing and analyzing multi-camera feeds poses challenges due to the vast amount of data. Analyzing such huge video data requires advanced analytical tools. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, equipped with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, excel in text-based tasks, integrating them into traffic video analysis demands converting video data into text using a Vision-Language Model (VLM), which is time-consuming and delays the timely utilization of traffic videos for generating insights and investigating incidents. To address these challenges, we propose TrafficLens, a tailored algorithm for multi-camera traffic intersections. TrafficLens employs a sequential approach, utilizing overlapping coverage areas of cameras. It iteratively applies VLMs with varying token limits, using previous outputs as prompts for subsequent cameras, enabling rapid generation of detailed textual descriptions while reducing processing time. Additionally, TrafficLens intelligently bypasses redundant VLM invocations through an object-level similarity detector. Experimental results with real-world datasets demonstrate that TrafficLens reduces video-to-text conversion time by up to $4\times$ while maintaining information accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗机构的协作机器学习需要保护患者隐私，传统联邦学习的梯度仍易受重建攻击，存在敏感医疗信息泄露风险。

Method: 使用Vision Transformers的CLS token作为紧凑特征表示，采用CKKS同态加密在传输前加密这些token，实现安全聚合。

Result: 在肺癌病理学分类的三客户端联邦设置中，梯度易受反演攻击（PSNR: 52.26 dB），而CLS保护的HE方法能防止此类攻击，每轮仅需326KB加密数据传输，在未加密域达到96.12%准确率，加密域达到90.02%。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持强隐私保证的同时大幅减少通信开销，为医疗联邦学习提供了有效的隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning across healthcare institutions promises improved diagnostic accuracy by leveraging diverse datasets, yet privacy regulations such as HIPAA prohibit direct patient data sharing. While federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training without raw data exchange, recent studies show that model gradients in conventional FL remain vulnerable to reconstruction attacks, potentially exposing sensitive medical information. This paper presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework combining Vision Transformers (ViT) with homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure multi-institutional histopathology classification. The approach leverages the ViT CLS token as a compact 768-dimensional feature representation for secure aggregation, encrypting these tokens using CKKS homomorphic encryption before transmission to the server. We demonstrate that encrypting CLS tokens achieves a 30-fold communication reduction compared to gradient encryption while maintaining strong privacy guarantees. Through evaluation on a three-client federated setup for lung cancer histopathology classification, we show that gradients are highly susceptible to model inversion attacks (PSNR: 52.26 dB, SSIM: 0.999, NMI: 0.741), enabling near-perfect image reconstruction. In contrast, the proposed CLS-protected HE approach prevents such attacks while enabling encrypted inference directly on ciphertexts, requiring only 326 KB of encrypted data transmission per aggregation round. The framework achieves 96.12 percent global classification accuracy in the unencrypted domain and 90.02 percent in the encrypted domain.

Result: 实验表明该方法能泛化到多种风格和内容，提供了高效有效的风格迁移流程。

Conclusion: 该无反转框架通过双整流流和动态融合机制，实现了高效、鲁棒的风格迁移，避免了传统反转方法的局限性。

Abstract: Style transfer, a pivotal task in image processing, synthesizes visually compelling images by seamlessly blending realistic content with artistic styles, enabling applications in photo editing and creative design. While mainstream training-free diffusion-based methods have greatly advanced style transfer in recent years, their reliance on computationally inversion processes compromises efficiency and introduces visual distortions when inversion is inaccurate. To address these limitations, we propose a novel \textit{inversion-free} style transfer framework based on dual rectified flows, which tackles the challenge of finding an unknown stylized distribution from two distinct inputs (content and style images), \textit{only with forward pass}. Our approach predicts content and style trajectories in parallel, then fuses them through a dynamic midpoint interpolation that integrates velocities from both paths while adapting to the evolving stylized image. By jointly modeling the content, style, and stylized distributions, our velocity field design achieves robust fusion and avoids the shortcomings of naive overlays. Attention injection further guides style integration, enhancing visual fidelity, content preservation, and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate generalization across diverse styles and content, providing an effective and efficient pipeline for style transfer.

Result: 在R2C7K基准测试中表现出与最先进方法相当或更优的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为Ref-COD提供了一条简单高效的路径，无需强制参考图像，提高了部署性和效率。

Abstract: Referring Camouflaged Object Detection (Ref-COD) segments specified camouflaged objects in a scene by leveraging a small set of referring images. Though effective, current systems adopt a dual-branch design that requires reference images at test time, which limits deployability and adds latency and data-collection burden. We introduce a Ref-COD framework that distills references into a class-prototype memory during training and synthesizes a reference vector at inference via a query-conditioned mixture of prototypes. Concretely, we maintain an EMA-updated prototype per category and predict mixture weights from the query to produce a guidance vector without any test-time references. To bridge the representation gap between reference statistics and camouflaged query features, we propose a bidirectional attention alignment module that adapts both the query features and the class representation. Thus, our approach yields a simple, efficient path to Ref-COD without mandatory references. We evaluate the proposed method on the large-scale R2C7K benchmark. Extensive experiments demonstrate competitive or superior performance of the proposed method compared with recent state-of-the-arts. Code is available at https://github.com/yuhuan-wu/RefOnce.

Abstract: Accurately localizing and segmenting obscured objects from faint light patterns beyond the field of view is highly challenging due to multiple scattering and medium-induced perturbations. Most existing methods, based on real-valued modeling or local convolutional operations, are inadequate for capturing the underlying physics of coherent light propagation. Moreover, under low signal-to-noise conditions, these methods often converge to non-physical solutions, severely compromising the stability and reliability of the observation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel physics-driven Wavefront Propagating Compensation Network (WavePCNet) to simulate wavefront propagation and enhance the perception of obscured objects. This WavePCNet integrates the Tri-Phase Wavefront Complex-Propagation Reprojection (TriWCP) to incorporate complex amplitude transfer operators to precisely constrain coherent propagation behavior, along with a momentum memory mechanism to effectively suppress the accumulation of perturbations. Additionally, a High-frequency Cross-layer Compensation Enhancement is introduced to construct frequency-selective pathways with multi-scale receptive fields and dynamically model structural consistency across layers, further boosting the model's robustness and interpretability under complex environmental conditions. Extensive experiments conducted on four physically collected datasets demonstrate that WavePCNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across both accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: GuardTrace-VL能够有效检测推理过程中出现的不安全内容，显著提升了多模态安全防护能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) are increasingly deployed for vision-language tasks that produce explicit intermediate rationales. However, reasoning traces can contain unsafe content even when the final answer is non-harmful, creating deployment risks. Existing multimodal safety guards primarily evaluate only the input question and the final answer, neglecting the intermediate reasoning process. This oversight allows undetected harm, such as biased inferences or policy-violating use of visual context, to emerge during reasoning. We introduce GuardTrace-VL, a vision-aware safety auditor that monitors the full Question-Thinking-Answer (QTA) pipeline via joint image-text analysis, enabling detection of unsafe content as it emerges in the reasoning stage. To support training and evaluation, we construct the GuardTrace dataset, which is generated through diverse prompting strategies and refined via a MLRM- and human-based voting and verification pipeline. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage progressive training scheme combined with the data refinement process, enabling the model to learn nuanced and context-dependent safety preferences according to different risk levels. On our proposed test set covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, GuardTrace-VL model achieves an F1 score of 93.1% on unsafe reasoning detection tasks, representing a 13.5% improvement in F1 score compared to the previous strongest multimodal safety defense methods. The codes will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 该方法为下游编辑和创意应用开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Images can be viewed as layered compositions, foreground objects over background, with potential occlusions. This layered representation enables independent editing of elements, offering greater flexibility for content creation. Despite the progress in large generative models, decomposing a single image into layers remains challenging due to limited methods and data. We observe a strong connection between layer decomposition and in/outpainting tasks, and propose adapting a diffusion-based inpainting model for layer decomposition using lightweight finetuning. To further preserve detail in the latent space, we introduce a novel multi-modal context fusion module with linear attention complexity. Our model is trained purely on a synthetic dataset constructed from open-source assets and achieves superior performance in object removal and occlusion recovery, unlocking new possibilities in downstream editing and creative applications.

Abstract: News image captioning aims to produce journalistically informative descriptions by combining visual content with contextual cues from associated articles. Despite recent advances, existing methods struggle with three key challenges: (1) incomplete information coverage, (2) weak cross-modal alignment, and (3) suboptimal visual-entity grounding. To address these issues, we introduce MERGE, the first Multimodal Entity-aware Retrieval-augmented GEneration framework for news image captioning. MERGE constructs an entity-centric multimodal knowledge base (EMKB) that integrates textual, visual, and structured knowledge, enabling enriched background retrieval. It improves cross-modal alignment through a multistage hypothesis-caption strategy and enhances visual-entity matching via dynamic retrieval guided by image content. Extensive experiments on GoodNews and NYTimes800k show that MERGE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with CIDEr gains of +6.84 and +1.16 in caption quality, and F1-score improvements of +4.14 and +2.64 in named entity recognition. Notably, MERGE also generalizes well to the unseen Visual News dataset, achieving +20.17 in CIDEr and +6.22 in F1-score, demonstrating strong robustness and domain adaptability.

Abstract: Selecting an appropriate pre-trained source model is a critical, yet computationally expensive, task in transfer learning. Model Transferability Estimation (MTE) methods address this by providing efficient proxy metrics to rank models without full fine-tuning. In practice, the choice of which MTE metric to use is often ad hoc or guided simply by a metric's average historical performance. However, we observe that the effectiveness of MTE metrics is highly task-dependent and no single metric is universally optimal across all target datasets. To address this gap, we introduce MetaRank, a meta-learning framework for automatic, task-aware MTE metric selection. We formulate metric selection as a learning-to-rank problem. Rather than relying on conventional meta-features, MetaRank encodes textual descriptions of both datasets and MTE metrics using a pretrained language model, embedding them into a shared semantic space. A meta-predictor is then trained offline on diverse meta-tasks to learn the intricate relationship between dataset characteristics and metric mechanisms, optimized with a listwise objective that prioritizes correctly ranking the top-performing metrics. During the subsequent online phase, MetaRank efficiently ranks the candidate MTE metrics for a new, unseen target dataset based on its textual description, enabling practitioners to select the most appropriate metric a priori. Extensive experiments across 11 pretrained models and 11 target datasets demonstrate the strong effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的可信多视图分类框架，通过原型表示各视图的邻居结构，简化了视图内邻居关系学习并实现视图间结构动态对齐，提高了多视图共识发现的效率和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可信多视图分类方法依赖全局密集邻居关系建模视图内依赖，计算成本高且无法直接保证视图间关系一致性，同时通常通过手动分配权重聚合不同视图证据，缺乏对学习到的多视图邻居结构在类别空间一致性的保证。

Method: 引入原型来表示每个视图的邻居结构，简化视图内邻居关系学习，实现视图内和视图间结构的动态对齐，促进更高效和一致的跨视图共识发现。

Result: 在多个公开多视图数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法与主流可信多视图分类方法相比，在性能和鲁棒性方面具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于原型的可信多视图分类框架能够有效克服现有方法的局限性，实现更高效和可靠的多视图分类。

Abstract: Trustworthy multi-view classification (TMVC) addresses the challenge of achieving reliable decision-making in complex scenarios where multi-source information is heterogeneous, inconsistent, or even conflicting. Existing TMVC approaches predominantly rely on globally dense neighbor relationships to model intra-view dependencies, leading to high computational costs and an inability to directly ensure consistency across inter-view relationships. Furthermore, these methods typically aggregate evidence from different views through manually assigned weights, lacking guarantees that the learned multi-view neighbor structures are consistent within the class space, thus undermining the trustworthiness of classification outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel TMVC framework that introduces prototypes to represent the neighbor structures of each view. By simplifying the learning of intra-view neighbor relations and enabling dynamic alignment of intra- and inter-view structure, our approach facilitates more efficient and consistent discovery of cross-view consensus. Extensive experiments on multiple public multi-view datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive downstream performance and robustness compared to prevalent TMVC methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CameraMaster是一个统一的相机感知图像修饰框架，通过解耦相机指令和参数嵌入，实现精确的物理一致图像编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖模糊的文本提示难以精确控制相机参数，要么需要为不同参数训练独立模块导致可扩展性差，无法支持多参数组合和细微变化。

Method: 提出CameraMaster框架，通过相机参数嵌入调制相机指令和内容语义，使用交叉注意力将调制后的指令注入内容特征，并在去噪过程中将指令和相机嵌入作为条件信号进行统一层间调制。

Result: 构建了包含78K图像-提示对的大规模数据集，实验表明CameraMaster对参数变化产生单调且近似线性的响应，支持无缝多参数组合，性能显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CameraMaster通过显式解耦和集成相机指令与参数嵌入，实现了物理一致且精确可控的图像修饰，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have greatly advanced image editing and generation. However, achieving physically consistent image retouching with precise parameter control (e.g., exposure, white balance, zoom) remains challenging. Existing methods either rely solely on ambiguous and entangled text prompts, which hinders precise camera control, or train separate heads/weights for parameter adjustment, which compromises scalability, multi-parameter composition, and sensitivity to subtle variations. To address these limitations, we propose CameraMaster, a unified camera-aware framework for image retouching. The key idea is to explicitly decouple the camera directive and then coherently integrate two critical information streams: a directive representation that captures the photographer's intent, and a parameter embedding that encodes precise camera settings. CameraMaster first uses the camera parameter embedding to modulate both the camera directive and the content semantics. The modulated directive is then injected into the content features via cross-attention, yielding a strongly camera-sensitive semantic context. In addition, the directive and camera embeddings are injected as conditioning and gating signals into the time embedding, enabling unified, layer-wise modulation throughout the denoising process and enforcing tight semantic-parameter alignment. To train and evaluate CameraMaster, we construct a large-scale dataset of 78K image-prompt pairs annotated with camera parameters. Extensive experiments show that CameraMaster produces monotonic and near-linear responses to parameter variations, supports seamless multi-parameter composition, and significantly outperforms existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出了CaptionQA基准，通过下游任务效用评估图像描述质量，在4个领域构建了33,027个密集标注的多选题，发现最先进的多模态模型在描述效用方面与图像本身存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估方法未能回答一个基本问题：描述能否在真实下游任务中替代图像？需要基于效用的基准来评估模型生成的描述质量。

Method: 创建可扩展的领域相关基准，涵盖自然、文档、电子商务和具身AI4个领域，构建33,027个需要视觉信息回答的多选题，通过LLM仅使用描述回答问题来直接测量描述效用。

Result: 评估显示最先进的多模态模型在描述效用方面与图像存在显著差距，在传统图像问答基准上表现相近的模型在描述效用上最多下降32%。

Conclusion: CaptionQA基准揭示了当前图像描述在支持下游任务方面的局限性，为评估描述质量提供了新的实用视角，并发布了开源扩展管道。

Abstract: Image captions serve as efficient surrogates for visual content in multimodal systems such as retrieval, recommendation, and multi-step agentic inference pipelines. Yet current evaluation practices miss a fundamental question: Can captions stand-in for images in real downstream tasks? We propose a utility-based benchmark, CaptionQA, to evaluate model-generated captions, where caption quality is measured by how well it supports downstream tasks. CaptionQA is an extensible domain-dependent benchmark covering 4 domains--Natural, Document, E-commerce, and Embodied AI--each with fine-grained taxonomies (25 top-level and 69 subcategories) that identify useful information for domain-specific tasks. CaptionQA builds 33,027 densely annotated multiple-choice questions (50.3 per image on average) that explicitly require visual information to answer, providing a comprehensive probe of caption utility. In our evaluation protocol, an LLM answers these questions using captions alone, directly measuring whether captions preserve image-level utility and are utilizable by a downstream LLM. Evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals substantial gaps between the image and its caption utility. Notably, models nearly identical on traditional image-QA benchmarks lower by up to 32% in caption utility. We release CaptionQA along with an open-source pipeline for extension to new domains. The code is available at https://github.com/bronyayang/CaptionQA.

Method: 结合MeanFlow与物理一致性约束实现高质量动作生成；采用BiMamba骨干网络和通道级跨模态融合的简单高效架构；支持非自回归生成和动作编辑功能。

Result: 在AIST++和FineDance数据集上的广泛实验表明，FlowerDance在动作质量和生成效率方面均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: FlowerDance不仅能生成具有物理合理性和艺术表现力的精细动作，还在推理速度和内存利用方面实现了显著的生成效率提升。

Abstract: Music-to-dance generation aims to translate auditory signals into expressive human motion, with broad applications in virtual reality, choreography, and digital entertainment. Despite promising progress, the limited generation efficiency of existing methods leaves insufficient computational headroom for high-fidelity 3D rendering, thereby constraining the expressiveness of 3D characters during real-world applications. Thus, we propose FlowerDance, which not only generates refined motion with physical plausibility and artistic expressiveness, but also achieves significant generation efficiency on inference speed and memory utilization . Specifically, FlowerDance combines MeanFlow with Physical Consistency Constraints, which enables high-quality motion generation with only a few sampling steps. Moreover, FlowerDance leverages a simple but efficient model architecture with BiMamba-based backbone and Channel-Level Cross-Modal Fusion, which generates dance with efficient non-autoregressive manner. Meanwhile, FlowerDance supports motion editing, enabling users to interactively refine dance sequences. Extensive experiments on AIST++ and FineDance show that FlowerDance achieves state-of-the-art results in both motion quality and generation efficiency. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Diagnosing lung cancer typically involves physicians identifying lung nodules in Computed tomography (CT) scans and generating diagnostic reports based on their morphological features and medical expertise. Although advancements have been made in using multimodal large language models for analyzing lung CT scans, challenges remain in accurately describing nodule morphology and incorporating medical expertise. These limitations affect the reliability and effectiveness of these models in clinical settings. Collaborative multi-agent systems offer a promising strategy for achieving a balance between generality and precision in medical applications, yet their potential in pathology has not been thoroughly explored. To bridge these gaps, we introduce LungNoduleAgent, an innovative collaborative multi-agent system specifically designed for analyzing lung CT scans. LungNoduleAgent streamlines the diagnostic process into sequential components, improving precision in describing nodules and grading malignancy through three primary modules. The first module, the Nodule Spotter, coordinates clinical detection models to accurately identify nodules. The second module, the Radiologist, integrates localized image description techniques to produce comprehensive CT reports. Finally, the Doctor Agent System performs malignancy reasoning by using images and CT reports, supported by a pathology knowledge base and a multi-agent system framework. Extensive testing on two private datasets and the public LIDC-IDRI dataset indicates that LungNoduleAgent surpasses mainstream vision-language models, agent systems, and advanced expert models. These results highlight the importance of region-level semantic alignment and multi-agent collaboration in diagnosing nodules. LungNoduleAgent stands out as a promising foundational tool for supporting clinical analyses of lung nodules.

Conclusion: 通过将生成先验与密集物理约束相结合，提出了一种能够同时保证物理准确性和感知真实性的图像去模糊框架，在严重模糊场景下表现出色。

Abstract: Spatially varying image deblurring remains a fundamentally ill-posed problem, especially when degradations arise from complex mixtures of motion and other forms of blur under significant noise. State-of-the-art learning-based approaches generally fall into two paradigms: model-based deep unrolling methods that enforce physical constraints by modeling the degradations, but often produce over-smoothed, artifact-laden textures, and generative models that achieve superior perceptual quality yet hallucinate details due to weak physical constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that uniquely reconciles these paradigms by taming a powerful generative prior with explicit, dense physical constraints. Rather than oversimplifying the degradation field, we model it as a dense continuum of high-dimensional compressed kernels, ensuring that minute variations in motion and other degradation patterns are captured. We leverage this rich descriptor field to condition a ControlNet architecture, strongly guiding the diffusion sampling process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively bridges the gap between physical accuracy and perceptual realism, outperforming state-of-the-art model-based methods as well as generative baselines in challenging, severely blurred scenarios.

Method: 采用测试时缩放策略，利用现成情感分类器进行梯度优化，通过语义相似度确定最佳引导时机，使用多情感损失减少固有和相似情感的干扰。

Result: 实验结果显示MUSE在生成和编辑任务中都优于所有方法，提高了情感准确性和语义多样性，同时在内容保持、文本提示遵循和情感表达之间保持最佳平衡。

Conclusion: MUSE为情感合成建立了新的范式，实现了统一的生成和编辑能力。

Abstract: Images evoke emotions that profoundly influence perception, often prioritized over content. Current Image Emotional Synthesis (IES) approaches artificially separate generation and editing tasks, creating inefficiencies and limiting applications where these tasks naturally intertwine, such as therapeutic interventions or storytelling. In this work, we introduce MUSE, the first unified framework capable of both emotional generation and editing. By adopting a strategy conceptually aligned with Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that widely used in both LLM and diffusion model communities, it avoids the requirement for additional updating diffusion model and specialized emotional synthesis datasets. More specifically, MUSE addresses three key questions in emotional synthesis: (1) HOW to stably guide synthesis by leveraging an off-the-shelf emotion classifier with gradient-based optimization of emotional tokens; (2) WHEN to introduce emotional guidance by identifying the optimal timing using semantic similarity as a supervisory signal; and (3) WHICH emotion to guide synthesis through a multi-emotion loss that reduces interference from inherent and similar emotions. Experimental results show that MUSE performs favorably against all methods for both generation and editing, improving emotional accuracy and semantic diversity while maintaining an optimal balance between desired content, adherence to text prompts, and realistic emotional expression. It establishes a new paradigm for emotion synthesis.

Conclusion: T-NIG模型能够有效处理不规则时间分布数据，在阿尔茨海默病预测中维持疾病特征，具有优秀的长期预测能力。

Abstract: Image generation can provide physicians with an imaging diagnosis basis in the prediction of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Recent research has shown that long-term AD predictions by image generation often face difficulties maintaining disease-related characteristics when dealing with irregular time intervals in sequential data. Considering that the time-related aspects of the distribution can reflect changes in disease-related characteristics when images are distributed unevenly, this research proposes a model to estimate the temporal parameter within the Normal Inverse Gamma Distribution (T-NIG) to assist in generating images over the long term. The T-NIG model employs brain images from two different time points to create intermediate brain images, forecast future images, and predict the disease. T-NIG is designed by identifying features using coordinate neighborhoods. It incorporates a time parameter into the normal inverse gamma distribution to understand how features change in brain imaging sequences that have varying time intervals. Additionally, T-NIG utilizes uncertainty estimation to reduce both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in the model, which arise from insufficient temporal data. In particular, the T-NIG model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term prediction tasks within the dataset. Experimental results indicate that T-NIG is proficient in forecasting disease progression while maintaining disease-related characteristics, even when faced with an irregular temporal data distribution.

Motivation: 基于扩散的图像编辑模型在处理复杂用户指令（如组合关系、上下文线索或指代表达）时往往难以准确理解，导致编辑结果语义漂移或无法反映预期变化。

Method: 提出MIRA多模态推理代理，采用迭代感知-推理-动作循环，逐步预测原子编辑指令，利用视觉反馈进行决策。使用150K多模态工具使用数据集MIRA-Editing，结合两阶段SFT + GRPO训练流程。

Result: 当与开源图像编辑模型（如Flux.1-Kontext、Step1X-Edit、Qwen-Image-Edit）配合使用时，MIRA显著提升了语义一致性和感知质量，性能达到或超过GPT-Image和Nano-Banana等专有系统。

Conclusion: MIRA通过模拟多轮人机交互过程，有效解决了复杂指令理解问题，为指令引导的图像编辑提供了更可靠和直观的解决方案。

Abstract: Instruction-guided image editing offers an intuitive way for users to edit images with natural language. However, diffusion-based editing models often struggle to accurately interpret complex user instructions, especially those involving compositional relationships, contextual cues, or referring expressions, leading to edits that drift semantically or fail to reflect the intended changes. We tackle this problem by proposing MIRA (Multimodal Iterative Reasoning Agent), a lightweight, plug-and-play multimodal reasoning agent that performs editing through an iterative perception-reasoning-action loop, effectively simulating multi-turn human-model interaction processes. Instead of issuing a single prompt or static plan, MIRA predicts atomic edit instructions step by step, using visual feedback to make its decisions. Our 150K multimodal tool-use dataset, MIRA-Editing, combined with a two-stage SFT + GRPO training pipeline, enables MIRA to perform reasoning and editing over complex editing instructions. When paired with open-source image editing models such as Flux.1-Kontext, Step1X-Edit, and Qwen-Image-Edit, MIRA significantly improves both semantic consistency and perceptual quality, achieving performance comparable to or exceeding proprietary systems such as GPT-Image and Nano-Banana.

Abstract: Iris authentication algorithms have achieved impressive recognition performance, making them highly promising for real-world applications such as border control, citizen identification, and both criminal investigations and commercial systems. However, their robustness is still challenged by variations in rotation, scale, specular reflections, and defocus blur. In addition, most existing approaches rely on straightforward point-to-point comparisons, typically using cosine or L2 distance, without effectively leveraging the spatio-spatial-temporal structure of iris patterns. To address these limitations, we propose a novel and generalized matching pipeline that learns rich spatio-spatial-temporal representations of iris features. Our approach first splits each iris image along one dimension, generating a sequence of sub-images that serve as input to a 3D-CNN, enabling the network to capture both spatial and spatio-spatial-temporal cues. To further enhance the modeling of spatio-spatial-temporal feature dynamics, we train the model in curriculum manner. This design allows the network to embed temporal dependencies directly into the feature space, improving discriminability in the deep metric domain. The framework is trained end-to-end with triplet and ArcFace loss in a curriculum manner, enforcing highly discriminative embeddings despite challenges like rotation, scale, reflections, and blur. This design yields a robust and generalizable solution for iris authentication.Github code: https://github.com/GeetanjaliGTZ/CLRecogEye

Conclusion: RadarFM通过结构化空间语言监督和对比学习，为雷达感知提供了统一的基础模型框架，克服了现有方法的碎片化问题。

Abstract: Radar sensors provide reliable perception across adverse weather, lighting, and long-range conditions. Recent advances in foundation models have transformed visual and language understanding, yet their integration with radar sensing remains largely underexplored. Existing radar approaches are fragmented and task-specific; each downstream task employs distinct architectures and training objectives, preventing transfer across tasks. In this work, we introduce RadarFM: a radar foundation model that learns unified scene-level representations through structured spatial language supervision. We make two key contributions: (1) a structured caption framework that encodes vehicle distributions in native radar coordinates, and (2) a hash-aware contrastive learning objective that quantifies continuous scene similarity rather than binary matching, enabling fine-grained spatial reasoning. Leveraging the CARLA simulator, we generate large-scale, well-annotated radar datasets across diverse driving scenarios. We also propose localization-aware metrics that assess spatial accuracy beyond traditional detection measures.

Motivation: 现有提示学习方法使用静态锚点（值和位置固定），缺乏跨任务和阶段自适应的灵活性，限制了CLIP模型的泛化能力。

Method: 提出AnchorOPT框架：1）动态学习任务特定的锚点值，而非手工设计；2）通过可学习位置矩阵自适应优化锚点与软标记的位置关系。采用两阶段训练：先学习锚点标记，然后冻结并转移到第二阶段优化软标记和位置矩阵。

Conclusion: AnchorOPT作为一个即插即用模块，可无缝集成到现有框架中，在不同数据集上带来一致的性能提升。

Abstract: Existing prompt learning methods, which are built upon CLIP models, leverage textual tokens as anchors to guide the learnable soft tokens. This guidance improves CLIP generalizations. However, these anchors-static in both value and position-lack cross-task and stage-adaptive flexibility. To address this limitation, we propose AnchorOPT, a dynamic anchor-based prompt learning framework. Specifically, AnchorOPT introduces dynamism in two key dimensions: (i) anchor values eschew handcrafted explicit textual tokens (e.g., "shape", "color"), instead learning dynamically from task-specific data; and (ii) the positional relationship between anchor and soft tokens is no longer fixed but adaptively optimized via a learnable position matrix conditioned on the training stage and task context. Training occurs in two stages: we first learn the anchor tokens, then freeze and transfer them to the second stage for optimization of soft tokens and the position matrix. Extensive experiments demonstrate that using only a simple learnable anchor and position matrix achieves performance comparable to or exceeding some methods incorporating additional learnable modules or regularization techniques. As a plug-and-play module, AnchorOPT integrates seamlessly into existing frameworks, yielding consistent performance gains across diverse datasets.

Motivation: 现有高效MLLMs通过压缩视觉令牌来减少资源消耗，但视觉信息丢失会降低理解能力。先前方法虽然引入知识蒸馏，但忽视了学生和教师模型之间视觉令牌不平衡导致的细粒度视觉理解差异。

Method: 1) 计算教师和学生视觉logits的曼哈顿距离，使用匈牙利匹配算法在空间维度对齐；2) 引入两种蒸馏策略：视觉-语言亲和力蒸馏(VLAD)和视觉语义蒸馏(VSD)，分别最小化亲和力矩阵的平滑L1距离和使用反向KL散度测量词汇空间中的离散概率分布。

Conclusion: EM-KD通过解决视觉令牌不平衡问题并引入有效的蒸馏策略，显著提升了高效MLLMs的性能，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) compress vision tokens to reduce resource consumption, but the loss of visual information can degrade comprehension capabilities. Although some priors introduce Knowledge Distillation to enhance student models, they overlook the fundamental differences in fine-grained vision comprehension caused by unbalanced vision tokens between the efficient student and vanilla teacher. In this paper, we propose EM-KD, a novel paradigm that enhances the Efficient MLLMs with Knowledge Distillation. To overcome the challenge of unbalanced vision tokens, we first calculate the Manhattan distance between the vision logits of teacher and student, and then align them in the spatial dimension with the Hungarian matching algorithm. After alignment, EM-KD introduces two distillation strategies: 1) Vision-Language Affinity Distillation (VLAD) and 2) Vision Semantic Distillation (VSD). Specifically, VLAD calculates the affinity matrix between text tokens and aligned vision tokens, and minimizes the smooth L1 distance of the student and the teacher affinity matrices. Considering the semantic richness of vision logits in the final layer, VSD employs the reverse KL divergence to measure the discrete probability distributions of the aligned vision logits over the vocabulary space. Comprehensive evaluation on diverse benchmarks demonstrates that EM-KD trained model outperforms prior Efficient MLLMs on both accuracy and efficiency with a large margin, validating its effectiveness. Compared with previous distillation methods, which are equipped with our proposed vision token matching strategy for fair comparison, EM-KD also achieves better performance.

*Jiyun Bae,Hyunjong Ok,Sangwoo Mo,Jaeho Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了视觉语言模型中无关信息（干扰项）对测试时扩展的影响，发现视觉干扰项与文本干扰项存在根本差异：虽然都存在逆扩展效应，但视觉干扰项会降低准确性而不增加推理长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究表明语言模型中的文本干扰项会导致推理变长但效果变差，本文旨在探究多模态环境中是否也存在类似现象。

Method: 引入Idis数据集，系统性地在语义、数值和空间维度上变化视觉干扰项，并通过分析推理轨迹中的属性计数来研究干扰项、推理长度和准确性的相互作用。

Result: 视觉干扰项会降低模型准确性但不增加推理长度，这种趋势也适用于已建立的视觉偏见基准测试（如Waterbirds）。

Conclusion: 提出了简单的提示策略来减轻推理模型中的偏见驱动预测，揭示了视觉干扰项与文本干扰项的根本差异。

Abstract: How does irrelevant information (i.e., distractors) affect test-time scaling in vision-language models (VLMs)? Prior studies on language models have reported an inverse scaling effect, where textual distractors lead to longer but less effective reasoning. To investigate whether similar phenomena occur in multimodal settings, we introduce Idis (Images with distractors), a visual question-answering dataset that systematically varies distractors along semantic, numerical, and spatial dimensions. Our analyses reveal that visual distractors differ fundamentally from textual ones: although inverse scaling persists, adding visual distractors reduces accuracy without increasing reasoning length. We further show that tracking attribute counts within reasoning traces provides key insights into how distractors, reasoning length, and accuracy interact. Finally, we demonstrate that these trends extend to established visual bias benchmarks such as Waterbirds, and we propose a simple prompting strategy to mitigate bias-driven predictions in reasoning models.

TL;DR: FaithFusion是一个3DGS-扩散模型融合框架，通过像素级期望信息增益(EIG)实现可控驾驶场景重建和3D场景生成，在保持几何保真度的同时合成视觉合理的外观。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在可控驾驶场景重建和3D场景生成中，需要在大的视角变化下保持几何保真度并合成视觉合理的外观。然而，基于几何的3DGS和外观驱动的扩散模型的有效融合面临挑战，缺乏像素级、3D一致的编辑标准会导致过度修复和几何漂移。

Method: 引入FaithFusion框架，使用像素级期望信息增益(EIG)作为统一策略进行连贯的时空合成：EIG作为空间先验指导扩散模型细化高不确定性区域，同时通过像素级权重将编辑结果蒸馏回3DGS。这是一个即插即用的系统，无需额外的先验条件和结构修改。

Result: 在Waymo数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在NTA-IoU、NTL-IoU和FID指标上达到最先进性能，即使在6米车道偏移时仍保持107.47的FID。

Conclusion: FaithFusion通过EIG驱动的融合策略成功解决了3DGS和扩散模型融合中的几何漂移问题，实现了高质量的驾驶场景重建和生成。

Abstract: In controllable driving-scene reconstruction and 3D scene generation, maintaining geometric fidelity while synthesizing visually plausible appearance under large viewpoint shifts is crucial. However, effective fusion of geometry-based 3DGS and appearance-driven diffusion models faces inherent challenges, as the absence of pixel-wise, 3D-consistent editing criteria often leads to over-restoration and geometric drift. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{FaithFusion}, a 3DGS-diffusion fusion framework driven by pixel-wise Expected Information Gain (EIG). EIG acts as a unified policy for coherent spatio-temporal synthesis: it guides diffusion as a spatial prior to refine high-uncertainty regions, while its pixel-level weighting distills the edits back into 3DGS. The resulting plug-and-play system is free from extra prior conditions and structural modifications.Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our approach attains SOTA performance across NTA-IoU, NTL-IoU, and FID, maintaining an FID of 107.47 even at 6 meters lane shift.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DATGN的新方法，通过自动学习脑部图像中的形态变化来预测阿尔茨海默病的进展，能够处理MRI时间序列中的缺失数据，并生成符合疾病进展的未来MRI图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病是一种退行性脑部疾病，早期预测有助于延缓其进展。当前预测方法主要依赖手动特征提取来分析脑部图像的形态变化，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: DATGN首先对不完整的MRI时间序列进行插值，然后通过双向时间变形感知模块引导网络生成符合疾病进展的未来MRI图像，实现早期预测。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上的实验结果显示，DATGN在PSNR和MMSE图像质量指标上表现优异。将DATGN生成的合成数据集成到分类方法中，AD vs NC分类准确率提高了6.21%到16%，AD vs MCI vs NC分类准确率提高了7.34%到21.25%。

Conclusion: DATGN能够生成与阿尔茨海默病脑萎缩趋势一致的MRI图像，实现疾病的早期预测，为阿尔茨海默病的自动化诊断提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a degenerative brain condition, can benefit from early prediction to slow its progression. As the disease progresses, patients typically undergo brain atrophy. Current prediction methods for Alzheimers disease largely involve analyzing morphological changes in brain images through manual feature extraction. This paper proposes a novel method, the Deformation-Aware Temporal Generative Network (DATGN), to automate the learning of morphological changes in brain images about disease progression for early prediction. Given the common occurrence of missing data in the temporal sequences of MRI images, DATGN initially interpolates incomplete sequences. Subsequently, a bidirectional temporal deformation-aware module guides the network in generating future MRI images that adhere to the disease's progression, facilitating early prediction of Alzheimer's disease. DATGN was tested for the generation of temporal sequences of future MRI images using the ADNI dataset, and the experimental results are competitive in terms of PSNR and MMSE image quality metrics. Furthermore, when DATGN-generated synthetic data was integrated into the SVM vs. CNN vs. 3DCNN-based classification methods, significant improvements were achieved from 6. 21\% to 16\% in AD vs. NC classification accuracy and from 7. 34\% to 21. 25\% in AD vs. MCI vs. NC classification accuracy. The qualitative visualization results indicate that DATGN produces MRI images consistent with the brain atrophy trend in Alzheimer's disease, enabling early disease prediction.

TL;DR: G²VLM是一个几何基础视觉语言模型，通过整合3D视觉几何特征来提升空间智能，在3D重建和空间理解任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在空间智能方面缺乏鲁棒性，主要由于缺少从2D图像重建3D空间的视觉几何学习过程。

Method: 提出G²VLM模型，原生利用学习的3D视觉几何特征直接预测3D属性，并通过上下文学习和交错推理增强空间推理任务。

Result: G²VLM在3D重建任务上达到与最先进前馈模型相当的结果，在空间理解和推理任务上取得更好或竞争性的表现。

Conclusion: 通过将语义强大的VLM与低级3D视觉任务统一，G²VLM可作为社区的强基线，并解锁更多未来应用如3D场景编辑。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still lack robustness in spatial intelligence, demonstrating poor performance on spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. We attribute this gap to the absence of a visual geometry learning process capable of reconstructing 3D space from 2D images. We present G$^2$VLM, a geometry grounded vision-language model that bridges two fundamental aspects of spatial intelligence: spatial 3D reconstruction and spatial understanding. G$^2$VLM natively leverages learned 3D visual geometry features to directly predict 3D attributes and enhance spatial reasoning tasks via in-context learning and interleaved reasoning. Our unified design is highly scalable for spatial understanding: it trains on abundant multi-view image and video data, while simultaneously leveraging the benefits of 3D visual priors that are typically only derived from hard-to-collect annotations. Experimental results demonstrate G$^2$VLM is proficient in both tasks, achieving comparable results to state-of-the-art feed-forward 3D reconstruction models and achieving better or competitive results across spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. By unifying a semantically strong VLM with low-level 3D vision tasks, we hope G$^2$VLM can serve as a strong baseline for the community and unlock more future applications, such as 3D scene editing.

TL;DR: EntPruner是一个基于熵引导的自动渐进剪枝框架，专门针对扩散模型和流模型，通过条件熵偏差评估模块重要性，实现高效参数压缩而不损失生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视觉生成模型在下游任务中存在显著的参数冗余问题，需要一种专门针对生成模型的剪枝方法，既能减少参数又能保持输出分布的多样性和条件保真度。

Method: 提出熵引导剪枝策略，使用数据依赖的条件熵偏差(CED)作为模块重要性评估指标；设计零样本自适应剪枝框架，动态决定何时剪枝以及剪枝多少，避免一次性剪枝导致的问题。

Result: 在DiT和SiT模型上的实验表明，EntPruner能实现最高2.22倍的推理加速，同时在ImageNet和三个下游数据集上保持竞争力的生成质量。

Conclusion: EntPruner为生成模型提供了一种有效的剪枝解决方案，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升推理效率，解决了生成模型在下游任务中的参数冗余问题。

Abstract: Large-scale vision generative models, including diffusion and flow models, have demonstrated remarkable performance in visual generation tasks. However, transferring these pre-trained models to downstream tasks often results in significant parameter redundancy. In this paper, we propose EntPruner, an entropy-guided automatic progressive pruning framework for diffusion and flow models. First, we introduce entropy-guided pruning, a block-level importance assessment strategy specifically designed for generative models. Unlike discriminative models, generative models require preserving the diversity and condition-fidelity of the output distribution. As the importance of each module can vary significantly across downstream tasks, EntPruner prioritizes pruning of less important blocks using data-dependent Conditional Entropy Deviation (CED) as a guiding metric. CED quantifies how much the distribution diverges from the learned conditional data distribution after removing a block. Second, we propose a zero-shot adaptive pruning framework to automatically determine when and how much to prune during training. This dynamic strategy avoids the pitfalls of one-shot pruning, mitigating mode collapse, and preserving model performance. Extensive experiments on DiT and SiT models demonstrate the effectiveness of EntPruner, achieving up to 2.22$\times$ inference speedup while maintaining competitive generation quality on ImageNet and three downstream datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度网络仍处于像素级学习阶段，无法让去模糊模型理解模糊的本质。模糊是由清晰图像与模糊核卷积引起的，因此让网络学习核级模糊过程可以显著提升去模糊性能。

Method: 提出傅里叶核估计器(FKE)，在傅里叶空间中进行激活操作，将空间域卷积转换为傅里叶空间乘法。使用网络提取的特征代替图像作为卷积对象，设计解耦多尺度架构，采用可逆策略的多层次子U-Net。

Conclusion: FKE方法通过核级模糊过程学习，有效提升了图像去模糊性能，证明了理解模糊本质对于去模糊任务的重要性。

Abstract: It is well-known that if a network aims to learn how to deblur, it should understand the blur process. Blurring is naturally caused by the convolution of the sharp image with the blur kernel. Thus, allowing the network to learn the blur process in the kernel-level can significantly improve the image deblurring performance. But, current deep networks are still at the pixel-level learning stage, either performing end-to-end pixel-level restoration or stage-wise pseudo kernel-level restoration, failing to enable the deblur model to understand the essence of the blur. To this end, we propose Fourier Kernel Estimator (FKE), which considers the activation operation in Fourier space and converts the convolution problem in the spatial domain to a multiplication problem in Fourier space. Our FKE, jointly optimized with the deblur model, enables the network to learn the kernel-level blur process with low complexity and without any additional supervision. Furthermore, we change the convolution object of the kernel from ``image" to network extracted ``feature", whose rich semantic and structural information is more suitable to blur process learning. With the convolution of the feature and the estimated kernel, our model can learn the essence of blur in kernel-level. To further improve the efficiency of feature extraction, we design a decoupled multi-scale architecture with multiple hierarchical sub-unets with a reversible strategy, which allows better multi-scale encoding and decoding in low training memory. Extensive experiments indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art motion deblurring results and show potential for handling other kernel-related problems. Analysis also shows our kernel estimator is able to learn physically meaningful kernels. The code will be available at https://github.com/DeepMed-Lab-ECNU/Single-Image-Deblur.

Motivation: 扩散模型在人类视频生成中面临高计算成本和内存消耗的挑战，需要更高效的训练方法。

Method: 提出条件熵膨胀(CEI)评估模型组件重要性，采用自适应渐进式调度动态增加计算复杂度。

Conclusion: Ent-Prog是一个有效的训练框架，显著降低了扩散模型在人类视频生成中的训练成本和内存需求。

Abstract: Human video generation has advanced rapidly with the development of diffusion models, but the high computational cost and substantial memory consumption associated with training these models on high-resolution, multi-frame data pose significant challenges. In this paper, we propose Entropy-Guided Prioritized Progressive Learning (Ent-Prog), an efficient training framework tailored for diffusion models on human video generation. First, we introduce Conditional Entropy Inflation (CEI) to assess the importance of different model components on the target conditional generation task, enabling prioritized training of the most critical components. Second, we introduce an adaptive progressive schedule that adaptively increases computational complexity during training by measuring the convergence efficiency. Ent-Prog reduces both training time and GPU memory consumption while maintaining model performance. Extensive experiments across three datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of Ent-Prog, achieving up to 2.2$\times$ training speedup and 2.4$\times$ GPU memory reduction without compromising generative performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProxyFormer是一种新的视频对象分割架构，通过引入代理查询来整合视觉和文本语义，解决现有方法在跨帧依赖性和文本约束延迟集成方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两个主要问题：条件查询缺乏帧间依赖性和变化建模，难以在帧间显著变化时准确跟踪目标；文本约束集成过晚，可能导致视频特征关注非目标对象。

Method: 提出ProxyFormer架构，使用代理查询集成视觉和文本语义，通过多阶段视频特征编码器逐步更新和传播代理查询。将跨模态交互解耦为时间和空间维度以降低计算成本，并设计联合语义一致性训练策略。

Result: 在四个广泛使用的RVOS基准测试上的综合实验表明，ProxyFormer优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: ProxyFormer通过代理查询机制有效解决了跨模态对齐问题，提高了目标跟踪的准确性和连贯性，同时通过解耦设计降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) is an emerging cross-modality task that aims to generate pixel-level maps of the target objects referred by given textual expressions. The main concept involves learning an accurate alignment of visual elements and language expressions within a semantic space. Recent approaches address cross-modality alignment through conditional queries, tracking the target object using a query-response based mechanism built upon transformer structure. However, they exhibit two limitations: (1) these conditional queries lack inter-frame dependency and variation modeling, making accurate target tracking challenging amid significant frame-to-frame variations; and (2) they integrate textual constraints belatedly, which may cause the video features potentially focus on the non-referred objects. Therefore, we propose a novel RVOS architecture called ProxyFormer, which introduces a set of proxy queries to integrate visual and text semantics and facilitate the flow of semantics between them. By progressively updating and propagating proxy queries across multiple stages of video feature encoder, ProxyFormer ensures that the video features are focused on the object of interest. This dynamic evolution also enables the establishment of inter-frame dependencies, enhancing the accuracy and coherence of object tracking. To mitigate high computational costs, we decouple cross-modality interactions into temporal and spatial dimensions. Additionally, we design a Joint Semantic Consistency (JSC) training strategy to align semantic consensus between the proxy queries and the combined video-text pairs. Comprehensive experiments on four widely used RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our ProxyFormer to the state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: TEAR是一个针对文本到视频模型安全性的自动化红队框架，通过时间感知的测试生成器来发现与视频时序动态相关的安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的安全评估方法主要针对静态图像和文本生成，无法捕捉视频生成中复杂的时间动态特性，因此需要专门针对T2V模型的安全评估框架。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：初始生成器训练和时间感知的在线偏好学习，通过优化生成器来制作看似无害但能利用时序动态引发违规视频输出的文本提示，并采用精炼模型循环提升提示的隐蔽性和对抗效果。

Result: 在开源和商业T2V系统上的广泛实验评估显示，TEAR实现了超过80%的攻击成功率，相比之前最佳结果57%有显著提升。

Conclusion: TEAR框架有效揭示了T2V模型中与时间动态相关的安全风险，证明了现有安全评估方法的不足，并为T2V模型的安全性评估提供了新思路。

Abstract: Text-to-Video (T2V) models are capable of synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent dynamic video content, but the diverse generation also inherently introduces critical safety challenges. Existing safety evaluation methods,which focus on static image and text generation, are insufficient to capture the complex temporal dynamics in video generation. To address this, we propose a TEmporal-aware Automated Red-teaming framework, named TEAR, an automated framework designed to uncover safety risks specifically linked to the dynamic temporal sequencing of T2V models. TEAR employs a temporal-aware test generator optimized via a two-stage approach: initial generator training and temporal-aware online preference learning, to craft textually innocuous prompts that exploit temporal dynamics to elicit policy-violating video output. And a refine model is adopted to improve the prompt stealthiness and adversarial effectiveness cyclically. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of TEAR across open-source and commercial T2V systems with over 80% attack success rate, a significant boost from prior best result of 57%.

TL;DR: 本文提出了LLaVA-UHD v3多模态大语言模型，采用渐进式视觉压缩(PVC)方法，在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算开销和首次响应时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型倾向于使用全局原生分辨率视觉编码，虽然提升了整体能力但带来了更大的计算开销。需要解决这种效率与性能的权衡问题。

Method: 提出渐进式视觉压缩(PVC)方法，包含两个关键模块：精炼补丁嵌入（支持灵活补丁大小缩放）和窗口化令牌压缩（在ViT层间分层部署以逐步聚合局部令牌表示）。

Result: 转换后的ViT-UHD在广泛基准测试中表现出与MoonViT相当的性能，同时将首次响应时间(TTFT)降低了2.4倍。LLaVA-UHD v3与Qwen2-VL性能相当，同时进一步将TTFT降低了1.9倍。

Conclusion: PVC方法能够将广泛预训练的ViT重新配置为高效架构，同时很大程度上保持通用性，为高效多模态大语言模型的研究提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Visual encoding followed by token condensing has become the standard architectural paradigm in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Many recent MLLMs increasingly favor global native- resolution visual encoding over slice-based methods. To investigate this trend, we systematically compare their behavior on vision-language understanding and attention patterns, revealing that global encoding enhances overall capability but at the expense of greater computational overhead. To address this issue, we present LLaVA-UHD v3, an MLLM centered upon our proposed Progressive Visual Compression (PVC) method, which can be seamlessly integrated into standard Vision Transformer (ViT) to enable efficient native-resolution encoding. The PVC approach consists of two key modules: (i) refined patch embedding, which supports flexible patch-size scaling for fine-grained visual model- ing, (ii) windowed token compression, hierarchically deployed across ViT layers to progressively aggregate local token representations. Jointly modulated by these two modules, a widely pretrained ViT can be reconfigured into an efficient architecture while largely preserving generality. Evaluated across extensive benchmarks, the transformed ViT, termed ViT-UHD, demonstrates competitive performance with MoonViT while reducing TTFT (time-to-first-token) by 2.4x, when developed within an identical MLLM architecture. Building upon ViT-UHD, LLaVA-UHD v3 also achieves competitive performance to Qwen2-VL, while further reducing TTFT by 1.9x. We will release all code and checkpoints to support future research on efficient MLLMs.

TL;DR: GridAR是一个视觉自回归模型的测试时扩展框架，通过网格分区渐进生成和布局指定提示重构策略，在有限计算资源下提升图像生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉自回归模型在测试时扩展方面存在挑战，直接应用Best-of-N等策略效率低下，因为光栅扫描解码缺乏对整个画布的蓝图规划，且错误轨迹消耗完整计算资源。

Method: GridAR采用网格分区渐进生成方案，在同一画布位置生成多个部分候选，早期修剪不可行候选，固定可行候选作为锚点指导后续解码；结合布局指定提示重构策略，通过部分视图推断可行布局。

Result: 在N=4时，GridAR比Best-of-N(N=8)在T2I-CompBench++上性能提升14.4%，成本降低25.6%；在图像编辑任务中，相比更大N的基线，语义保持度提升13.9%。

Conclusion: GridAR框架有效解决了视觉自回归模型的测试时扩展问题，在有限计算资源下实现了更高质量的图像生成和编辑效果。

Abstract: Recent visual autoregressive (AR) models have shown promising capabilities in text-to-image generation, operating in a manner similar to large language models. While test-time computation scaling has brought remarkable success in enabling reasoning-enhanced outputs for challenging natural language tasks, its adaptation to visual AR models remains unexplored and poses unique challenges. Naively applying test-time scaling strategies such as Best-of-N can be suboptimal: they consume full-length computation on erroneous generation trajectories, while the raster-scan decoding scheme lacks a blueprint of the entire canvas, limiting scaling benefits as only a few prompt-aligned candidates are generated. To address these, we introduce GridAR, a test-time scaling framework designed to elicit the best possible results from visual AR models. GridAR employs a grid-partitioned progressive generation scheme in which multiple partial candidates for the same position are generated within a canvas, infeasible ones are pruned early, and viable ones are fixed as anchors to guide subsequent decoding. Coupled with this, we present a layout-specified prompt reformulation strategy that inspects partial views to infer a feasible layout for satisfying the prompt. The reformulated prompt then guides subsequent image generation to mitigate the blueprint deficiency. Together, GridAR achieves higher-quality results under limited test-time scaling: with N=4, it even outperforms Best-of-N (N=8) by 14.4% on T2I-CompBench++ while reducing cost by 25.6%. It also generalizes to autoregressive image editing, showing comparable edit quality and a 13.9% gain in semantic preservation on PIE-Bench over larger-N baselines.

Conclusion: NDTokenizer3D提供了一个细粒度、通用的3D视觉语言模型，通过紧凑统一的设计桥接了语言级推理与3D空间理解。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D vision-language models (VLMs) highlight a strong potential for 3D scene understanding and reasoning. However, effectively tokenizing 3D scenes into holistic scene tokens, and leveraging these tokens across diverse 3D understanding tasks, remain highly challenging. We present NDTokenizer3D, a generalist 3D VLM that performs a wide range of 3D scene understanding tasks while naturally supporting human interactions, thereby bridging language-level reasoning with 3D spatial understanding. The core of our approach is a novel three-stage scene tokenization pipeline built upon a Multi-Scale Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) representation, paired with a Multi-Scale NDT Decoder (MSDec). Specifically, NDTokenizer3D first constructs a multi-scale NDT representation from raw high-resolution point clouds, preserving both global context and fine-grained geometric details. Next, the MSDec progressively fuses cross-scale NDT features, producing holistic scene tokens consumable by LLM endpoints. Beyond tokenization, MSDec is repurposed as a general interface for human-interactive prompting (points, boxes, masks) and segmentation-mask decoding, unifying diverse 3D scene understanding tasks within a single architecture. With this compact and unified design, NDTokenizer3D offers a fine-grained, general-purpose 3D VLM, achieving remarkable improvements in 3D Referring Segmentation, 3D Visual Question Answering, and 3D Dense Captioning.

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了基于补丁的实用攻击面，为未来防御研究建立了强基准。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, yet universal and transferable attacks remain underexplored, as most existing patches overfit to a single model and fail in black-box settings. To address this gap, we present a systematic study of universal, transferable adversarial patches against VLA-driven robots under unknown architectures, finetuned variants, and sim-to-real shifts. We introduce UPA-RFAS (Universal Patch Attack via Robust Feature, Attention, and Semantics), a unified framework that learns a single physical patch in a shared feature space while promoting cross-model transfer. UPA-RFAS combines (i) a feature-space objective with an $\ell_1$ deviation prior and repulsive InfoNCE loss to induce transferable representation shifts, (ii) a robustness-augmented two-phase min-max procedure where an inner loop learns invisible sample-wise perturbations and an outer loop optimizes the universal patch against this hardened neighborhood, and (iii) two VLA-specific losses: Patch Attention Dominance to hijack text$\to$vision attention and Patch Semantic Misalignment to induce image-text mismatch without labels.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCBoost是一个参数自由的插件方法，通过利用可靠的局部结构线索来增强深度聚类模型的全局特征结构，显著提升聚类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度聚类方法存在全局和局部特征结构不一致的问题：局部结构在类内样本中表现出强一致性和紧凑性，而全局特征往往呈现交织边界和分离不良的聚类。

Method: 首先通过基于自适应k近邻的一致性过滤识别高置信度样本作为可信锚点，然后利用这些样本计算判别性损失，促进类内紧凑性和类间分离性来指导网络优化。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，DCBoost显著提升了各种现有深度聚类模型的性能，将当前最先进基线（如ProPos）的性能提高了3%以上，并将轮廓系数放大了7倍以上。

Conclusion: DCBoost作为一种参数自由的插件方法，能够有效利用局部结构信息来增强全局特征表示，从而显著提升深度聚类模型的性能。

Abstract: Recent deep clustering models have produced impressive clustering performance. However, a common issue with existing methods is the disparity between global and local feature structures. While local structures typically show strong consistency and compactness within class samples, global features often present intertwined boundaries and poorly separated clusters. Motivated by this observation, we propose DCBoost, a parameter-free plug-in designed to enhance the global feature structures of current deep clustering models. By harnessing reliable local structural cues, our method aims to elevate clustering performance effectively. Specifically, we first identify high-confidence samples through adaptive $k$-nearest neighbors-based consistency filtering, aiming to select a sufficient number of samples with high label reliability to serve as trustworthy anchors for self-supervision. Subsequently, these samples are utilized to compute a discriminative loss, which promotes both intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, to guide network optimization. Extensive experiments across various benchmark datasets showcase that our DCBoost significantly improves the clustering performance of diverse existing deep clustering models. Notably, our method improves the performance of current state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., ProPos) by more than 3% and amplifies the silhouette coefficient by over $7\times$.

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated a remarkable ability to learn rich, transferable representations across diverse modalities such as images, text, and audio. In modern machine learning pipelines, these representations often replace raw data as the primary input for downstream tasks. In this paper, we address the challenge of adapting a pre-trained foundation model to inject domain-specific knowledge, without retraining from scratch or incurring significant computational costs. To this end, we introduce BotaCLIP, a lightweight multimodal contrastive framework that adapts a pre-trained Earth Observation foundation model (DOFA) by aligning high-resolution aerial imagery with botanical relevés. Unlike generic embeddings, BotaCLIP internalizes ecological structure through contrastive learning with a regularization strategy that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Once trained, the resulting embeddings serve as transferable representations for downstream predictors. Motivated by real-world applications in biodiversity modeling, we evaluated BotaCLIP representations in three ecological tasks: plant presence prediction, butterfly occurrence modeling, and soil trophic group abundance estimation. The results showed consistent improvements over those derived from DOFA and supervised baselines. More broadly, this work illustrates how domain-aware adaptation of foundation models can inject expert knowledge into data-scarce settings, enabling frugal representation learning.

Result: 在广泛使用的动作识别基准测试中，该方法优于之前的最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: ART框架通过发现和跟踪局部细节动态，能够有效区分相似动作，在细粒度动作识别任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Fine-grained action recognition (FGAR) aims to identify subtle and distinctive differences among fine-grained action categories. However, current recognition methods often capture coarse-grained motion patterns but struggle to identify subtle details in local regions evolving over time. In this work, we introduce the Action-Region Tracking (ART) framework, a novel solution leveraging a query-response mechanism to discover and track the dynamics of distinctive local details, enabling effective distinction of similar actions. Specifically, we propose a region-specific semantic activation module that employs discriminative and text-constrained semantics as queries to capture the most action-related region responses in each video frame, facilitating interaction among spatial and temporal dimensions with corresponding video features. The captured region responses are organized into action tracklets, which characterize region-based action dynamics by linking related responses across video frames in a coherent sequence. The text-constrained queries encode nuanced semantic representations derived from textual descriptions of action labels extracted by language branches within Visual Language Models (VLMs). To optimize the action tracklets, we design a multi-level tracklet contrastive constraint among region responses at spatial and temporal levels, enabling effective discrimination within each frame and correlation between adjacent frames. Additionally, a task-specific fine-tuning mechanism refines textual semantics such that semantic representations encoded by VLMs are preserved while optimized for task preferences. Comprehensive experiments on widely used action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the superiority to previous state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: ConFu框架能够有效捕捉多模态间的高阶依赖关系，同时保持配对对应性，为多模态学习提供了统一的对比学习解决方案。

Abstract: Learning joint representations across multiple modalities remains a central challenge in multimodal machine learning. Prevailing approaches predominantly operate in pairwise settings, aligning two modalities at a time. While some recent methods aim to capture higher-order interactions among multiple modalities, they often overlook or insufficiently preserve pairwise relationships, limiting their effectiveness on single-modality tasks. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Fusion (ConFu), a framework that jointly embeds both individual modalities and their fused combinations into a unified representation space, where modalities and their fused counterparts are aligned. ConFu extends traditional pairwise contrastive objectives with an additional fused-modality contrastive term, encouraging the joint embedding of modality pairs with a third modality. This formulation enables ConFu to capture higher-order dependencies, such as XOR-like relationships, that cannot be recovered through pairwise alignment alone, while still maintaining strong pairwise correspondence. We evaluate ConFu on synthetic and real-world multimodal benchmarks, assessing its ability to exploit cross-modal complementarity, capture higher-order dependencies, and scale with increasing multimodal complexity. Across these settings, ConFu demonstrates competitive performance on retrieval and classification tasks, while supporting unified one-to-one and two-to-one retrieval within a single contrastive framework.

TL;DR: 比较三种生成模型：DDPM、CFM和MeanFlow。CFM在50步采样时FID为24.15，显著优于DDPM的402.98。MeanFlow单步采样FID为29.15，推理时间减少50倍。CFM扩展至图像修复，在多种掩码类型下PSNR和SSIM显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同生成建模范式的性能差异，特别是比较迭代采样方法（DDPM、CFM）与直接一步生成方法（MeanFlow），并探索CFM在图像修复任务中的应用潜力。

Method: 使用统一的TinyUNet架构（<1.5M参数）在CIFAR-10数据集上实现DDPM、CFM和MeanFlow三种方法。CFM采用条件流匹配，DDPM使用去噪扩散概率模型，MeanFlow通过建模时间间隔内的平均速度实现一步生成。

Result: CFM在50步采样时FID为24.15，DDPM为402.98。MeanFlow单步采样FID为29.15。图像修复实验中，PSNR从4.95提升至8.57 dB（+73%），SSIM从0.289提升至0.418（+45%）。

Conclusion: CFM在生成质量上显著优于DDPM，MeanFlow在保持较好生成质量的同时大幅减少推理时间。CFM扩展至图像修复任务表现优异，验证了修复感知训练的有效性。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive comparative study of three generative modeling paradigms: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), Conditional Flow Matching (CFM), and MeanFlow. While DDPM and CFM require iterative sampling, MeanFlow enables direct one-step generation by modeling the average velocity over time intervals. We implement all three methods using a unified TinyUNet architecture (<1.5M parameters) on CIFAR-10, demonstrating that CFM achieves an FID of 24.15 with 50 steps, significantly outperforming DDPM (FID 402.98). MeanFlow achieves FID 29.15 with single-step sampling -- a 50X reduction in inference time. We further extend CFM to image inpainting, implementing mask-guided sampling with four mask types (center, random bbox, irregular, half). Our fine-tuned inpainting model achieves substantial improvements: PSNR increases from 4.95 to 8.57 dB on center masks (+73%), and SSIM improves from 0.289 to 0.418 (+45%), demonstrating the effectiveness of inpainting-aware training.

Motivation: 开发实时、低功耗的边缘部署系统，用于交通基础设施的结构安全监测，特别是可移动混凝土护栏的异常检测。

Method: 集成尺度不变特征变换(SIFT)进行空间特征编码，使用延迟驱动的脉冲转换层和泄漏积分点火( LIF)脉冲神经网络(SNN)进行分类。

Result: 在6,000个标记帧的数据集上达到92.3%的分类准确率，每帧推理时间为9.5ms，稀疏脉冲活动率为8.1%。

Conclusion: SIFT-SNN框架能够实现实时、低功耗的边缘部署，相比传统CNN方法具有更好的空间特征保持和可解释性，但在未见现场条件下的泛化能力仍需验证。

Abstract: This paper presents the SIFT-SNN framework, a low-latency neuromorphic signal-processing pipeline for real-time detection of structural anomalies in transport infrastructure. The proposed approach integrates Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for spatial feature encoding with a latency-driven spike conversion layer and a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for classification. The Auckland Harbour Bridge dataset is recorded under various weather and lighting conditions, comprising 6,000 labelled frames that include both real and synthetically augmented unsafe cases. The presented system achieves a classification accuracy of 92.3% (+- 0.8%) with a per-frame inference time of 9.5 ms. Achieved sub-10 millisecond latency, combined with sparse spike activity (8.1%), enables real-time, low-power edge deployment. Unlike conventional CNN-based approaches, the hybrid SIFT-SNN pipeline explicitly preserves spatial feature grounding, enhances interpretability, supports transparent decision-making, and operates efficiently on embedded hardware. Although synthetic augmentation improved robustness, generalisation to unseen field conditions remains to be validated. The SIFT-SNN framework is validated through a working prototype deployed on a consumer-grade system and framed as a generalisable case study in structural safety monitoring for movable concrete barriers, which, as a traffic flow-control infrastructure, is deployed in over 20 cities worldwide.

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的数据集上进行的广泛实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的T3-Tracer是第一个联合分析帧、片段和音频三个层次来全面检测伪造痕迹的框架，有效解决了部分音频伪造检测的挑战。

Abstract: Recently, partial audio forgery has emerged as a new form of audio manipulation. Attackers selectively modify partial but semantically critical frames while preserving the overall perceptual authenticity, making such forgeries particularly difficult to detect. Existing methods focus on independently detecting whether a single frame is forged, lacking the hierarchical structure to capture both transient and sustained anomalies across different temporal levels. To address these limitations, We identify three key levels relevant to partial audio forgery detection and present T3-Tracer, the first framework that jointly analyzes audio at the frame, segment, and audio levels to comprehensively detect forgery traces. T3-Tracer consists of two complementary core modules: the Frame-Audio Feature Aggregation Module (FA-FAM) and the Segment-level Multi-Scale Discrepancy-Aware Module (SMDAM). FA-FAM is designed to detect the authenticity of each audio frame. It combines both frame-level and audio-level temporal information to detect intra-frame forgery cues and global semantic inconsistencies. To further refine and correct frame detection, we introduce SMDAM to detect forgery boundaries at the segment level. It adopts a dual-branch architecture that jointly models frame features and inter-frame differences across multi-scale temporal windows, effectively identifying abrupt anomalies that appeared on the forged boundaries. Extensive experiments conducted on three challenging datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have highlighted their potential for medical and surgical applications. However, existing surgical datasets predominantly adopt a Visual Question Answering (VQA) format with heterogeneous taxonomies and lack support for pixel-level segmentation, limiting consistent evaluation and applicability. We present SurgMLLMBench, a unified multimodal benchmark explicitly designed for developing and evaluating interactive multimodal LLMs for surgical scene understanding, including the newly collected Micro-surgical Artificial Vascular anastomosIS (MAVIS) dataset. It integrates pixel-level instrument segmentation masks and structured VQA annotations across laparoscopic, robot-assisted, and micro-surgical domains under a unified taxonomy, enabling comprehensive evaluation beyond traditional VQA tasks and richer visual-conversational interactions. Extensive baseline experiments show that a single model trained on SurgMLLMBench achieves consistent performance across domains and generalizes effectively to unseen datasets. SurgMLLMBench will be publicly released as a robust resource to advance multimodal surgical AI research, supporting reproducible evaluation and development of interactive surgical reasoning models.

Abstract: Facial expressions convey the bulk of emotional information in human communication, yet existing 3D face reconstruction methods often miss subtle affective details due to reliance on 2D supervision and lack of 3D ground truth. We propose FIELDS (Face reconstruction with accurate Inference of Expression using Learning with Direct Supervision) to address these limitations by extending self-supervised 2D image consistency cues with direct 3D expression parameter supervision and an auxiliary emotion recognition branch. Our encoder is guided by authentic expression parameters from spontaneous 4D facial scans, while an intensity-aware emotion loss encourages the 3D expression parameters to capture genuine emotion content without exaggeration. This dual-supervision strategy bridges the 2D/3D domain gap and mitigates expression-intensity bias, yielding high-fidelity 3D reconstructions that preserve subtle emotional cues. From a single image, FIELDS produces emotion-rich face models with highly realistic expressions, significantly improving in-the-wild facial expression recognition performance without sacrificing naturalness.

Abstract: "Thinking with images" has emerged as an effective paradigm for advancing visual reasoning, extending beyond text-only chains of thought by injecting visual evidence into intermediate reasoning steps. However, existing methods fall short of human-like abstract visual thinking, as their flexibility is fundamentally limited by external tools. In this work, we introduce Monet, a training framework that enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to reason directly within the latent visual space by generating continuous embeddings that function as intermediate visual thoughts. We identify two core challenges in training MLLMs for latent visual reasoning: high computational cost in latent-vision alignment and insufficient supervision over latent embeddings, and address them with a three-stage distillation-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) pipeline. We further reveal a limitation of applying GRPO to latent reasoning: it primarily enhances text-based reasoning rather than latent reasoning. To overcome this, we propose VLPO (Visual-latent Policy Optimization), a reinforcement learning method that explicitly incorporates latent embeddings into policy gradient updates. To support SFT, we construct Monet-SFT-125K, a high-quality text-image interleaved CoT dataset containing 125K real-world, chart, OCR, and geometry CoTs. Our model, Monet-7B, shows consistent gains across real-world perception and reasoning benchmarks and exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization on challenging abstract visual reasoning tasks. We also empirically analyze the role of each training component and discuss our early unsuccessful attempts, providing insights for future developments in visual latent reasoning. Our model, data, and code are available at https://github.com/NOVAglow646/Monet.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks have shown remarkable performance in recent years on various computer vision problems. However, the traditional convolutional neural network architecture lacks a critical property: shift equivariance and invariance, broken by downsampling and upsampling operations. Although data augmentation techniques can help the model learn the latter property empirically, a consistent and systematic way to achieve this goal is by designing downsampling and upsampling layers that theoretically guarantee these properties by construction. Adaptive Polyphase Sampling (APS) introduced the cornerstone for shift invariance, later extended to shift equivariance with Learnable Polyphase up/downsampling (LPS) applied to real-valued neural networks. In this paper, we extend the work on LPS to complex-valued neural networks both from a theoretical perspective and with a novel building block of a projection layer from $\mathbb{C}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ before the Gumbel Softmax. We finally evaluate this extension on several computer vision problems, specifically for either the invariance property in classification tasks or the equivariance property in both reconstruction and semantic segmentation problems, using polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar images.

Abstract: The threat of Audio-Video (AV) forgery is rapidly evolving beyond human-centric deepfakes to include more diverse manipulations across complex natural scenes. However, existing benchmarks are still confined to DeepFake-based forgeries and single-granularity annotations, thus failing to capture the diversity and complexity of real-world forgery scenarios. To address this, we introduce AVFakeBench, the first comprehensive audio-video forgery detection benchmark that spans rich forgery semantics across both human subject and general subject. AVFakeBench comprises 12K carefully curated audio-video questions, covering seven forgery types and four levels of annotations. To ensure high-quality and diverse forgeries, we propose a multi-stage hybrid forgery framework that integrates proprietary models for task planning with expert generative models for precise manipulation. The benchmark establishes a multi-task evaluation framework covering binary judgment, forgery types classification, forgery detail selection, and explanatory reasoning. We evaluate 11 Audio-Video Large Language Models (AV-LMMs) and 2 prevalent detection methods on AVFakeBench, demonstrating the potential of AV-LMMs as emerging forgery detectors while revealing their notable weaknesses in fine-grained perception and reasoning.

Abstract: Generative world models for autonomous driving (AD) have become a trending topic. Unlike the widely studied image modality, in this work we explore generative world models for LiDAR data. Existing generation methods for LiDAR data only support single frame generation, while existing prediction approaches require multiple frames of historical input and can only deterministically predict multiple frames at once, lacking interactivity. Both paradigms fail to support long-horizon interactive generation. To this end, we introduce LaGen, which to the best of our knowledge is the first framework capable of frame-by-frame autoregressive generation of long-horizon LiDAR scenes. LaGen is able to take a single-frame LiDAR input as a starting point and effectively utilize bounding box information as conditions to generate high-fidelity 4D scene point clouds. In addition, we introduce a scene decoupling estimation module to enhance the model's interactive generation capability for object-level content, as well as a noise modulation module to mitigate error accumulation during long-horizon generation. We construct a protocol based on nuScenes for evaluating long-horizon LiDAR scene generation. Experimental results comprehensively demonstrate LaGen outperforms state-of-the-art LiDAR generation and prediction models, especially on the later frames.

Abstract: Remote sensing change captioning is an emerging and popular research task that aims to describe, in natural language, the content of interest that has changed between two remote sensing images captured at different times. Existing methods typically employ CNNs/Transformers to extract visual representations from the given images or incorporate auxiliary tasks to enhance the final results, with weak region awareness and limited temporal alignment. To address these issues, this paper explores the use of the SAM (Segment Anything Model) foundation model to extract region-level representations and inject region-of-interest knowledge into the captioning framework. Specifically, we employ a CNN/Transformer model to extract global-level vision features, leverage the SAM foundation model to delineate semantic- and motion-level change regions, and utilize a specially constructed knowledge graph to provide information about objects of interest. These heterogeneous sources of information are then fused via cross-attention, and a Transformer decoder is used to generate the final natural language description of the observed changes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple widely used benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: MatchGS是一个利用3D高斯泼溅技术生成高质量图像匹配训练数据的框架，通过几何修正和2D-3D表示对齐，显著提升零样本图像匹配性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于学习的图像匹配需要大规模、多样化且几何准确的训练数据。3D高斯泼溅技术虽能生成逼真新视角图像，但其几何不准确性和深度渲染偏差限制了其在对应关系标注中的应用。

Method: 1) 几何准确的数据生成流程：修正3DGS几何以产生精确对应标签；2) 2D-3D表示对齐策略：将3DGS的显式3D知识注入2D匹配器中，指导学习视角不变的3D表示。

Result: 生成的对应关系将极线误差降低高达40倍，在公共基准测试中使最先进的匹配器零样本性能提升达17.7%。

Conclusion: 通过适当的几何修正，3DGS可以作为可扩展、高保真且结构丰富的数据源，为新一代鲁棒零样本图像匹配器铺平道路。

Abstract: Learning-based image matching critically depends on large-scale, diverse, and geometrically accurate training data. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables photorealistic novel-view synthesis and thus is attractive for data generation. However, its geometric inaccuracies and biased depth rendering currently prevent robust correspondence labeling. To address this, we introduce MatchGS, the first framework designed to systematically correct and leverage 3DGS for robust, zero-shot image matching. Our approach is twofold: (1) a geometrically-faithful data generation pipeline that refines 3DGS geometry to produce highly precise correspondence labels, enabling the synthesis of a vast and diverse range of viewpoints without compromising rendering fidelity; and (2) a 2D-3D representation alignment strategy that infuses 3DGS' explicit 3D knowledge into the 2D matcher, guiding 2D semi-dense matchers to learn viewpoint-invariant 3D representations. Our generated ground-truth correspondences reduce the epipolar error by up to 40 times compared to existing datasets, enable supervision under extreme viewpoint changes, and provide self-supervisory signals through Gaussian attributes. Consequently, state-of-the-art matchers trained solely on our data achieve significant zero-shot performance gains on public benchmarks, with improvements of up to 17.7%. Our work demonstrates that with proper geometric refinement, 3DGS can serve as a scalable, high-fidelity, and structurally-rich data source, paving the way for a new generation of robust zero-shot image matchers.

Abstract: We present a novel unsupervised framework to unlock vast unlabeled human demonstration data from continuous industrial video streams for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model pre-training. Our method first trains a lightweight motion tokenizer to encode motion dynamics, then employs an unsupervised action segmenter leveraging a novel "Latent Action Energy" metric to discover and segment semantically coherent action primitives. The pipeline outputs both segmented video clips and their corresponding latent action sequences, providing structured data directly suitable for VLA pre-training. Evaluations on public benchmarks and a proprietary electric motor assembly dataset demonstrate effective segmentation of key tasks performed by humans at workstations. Further clustering and quantitative assessment via a Vision-Language Model confirm the semantic coherence of the discovered action primitives. To our knowledge, this is the first fully automated end-to-end system for extracting and organizing VLA pre-training data from unstructured industrial videos, offering a scalable solution for embodied AI integration in manufacturing.

Abstract: With Transformers achieving outstanding performance on individual remote sensing (RS) tasks, we are now approaching the realization of a unified model that excels across multiple tasks through multi-task learning (MTL). Compared to single-task approaches, MTL methods offer improved generalization, enhanced scalability, and greater practical applicability. Recently, vision language models (VLMs) have achieved promising results in RS image understanding, grounding, and ultra-high-resolution (UHR) image reasoning, respectively. Moreover, the unified text-based interface demonstrates significant potential for MTL. Hence, in this work, we present RSCoVLM, a simple yet flexible VLM baseline for RS MTL. Firstly, we create the data curation engine, including data acquisition, offline processing and integrating, as well as online loading and weighting. This data engine effectively addresses complex RS data enviroment and generates flexible vision-language conversations. Furthermore, we propose a unified dynamic-resolution strategy to address the diverse image scales inherent in RS imagery. For UHR images, we introduce the Zoom-in Chain mechanism together with its corresponding dataset, LRS-VQA-Zoom. The strategies are flexible and effectively mitigate the computational burdens. Additionally, we significantly enhance the model's object detection capability and propose a novel evaluation protocol that ensures fair comparison between VLMs and conventional detection models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSCoVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks, outperforming existing RS VLMs and even rivaling specialized expert models. All the training and evaluating tools, model weights, and datasets have been fully open-sourced to support reproducibility. We expect that this baseline will promote further progress toward general-purpose RS models.

Abstract: Event cameras produce asynchronous event streams that are spatially sparse yet temporally dense. Mainstream event representation learning algorithms typically use event frames, voxels, or tensors as input. Although these approaches have achieved notable progress, they struggle to address the undersampling problem caused by spatial sparsity. In this paper, we propose a novel hypergraph-guided spatio-temporal event stream completion mechanism, which connects event tokens across different times and spatial locations via hypergraphs and leverages contextual information message passing to complete these sparse events. The proposed method can flexibly incorporate RGB tokens as nodes in the hypergraph within this completion framework, enabling multi-modal hypergraph-based information completion. Subsequently, we aggregate hypergraph node information across different time steps through self-attention, enabling effective learning and fusion of multi-modal features. Extensive experiments on both single- and multi-label event classification tasks fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

<details>

Motivation: 现有基于Vision Transformer的方法虽然能捕捉全局上下文，但二次复杂度限制了在资源受限平台上的部署效率，而Mamba模型具有线性时间效率，特别适合建模长连续结构

Method: 提出PathMamba混合架构，集成Mamba的顺序建模能力和Transformer的全局推理能力，使用Mamba块追踪道路网络的连续特性，Transformer块用全局上下文细化特征

Conclusion: PathMamba通过结合Mamba和Transformer的互补优势，实现了拓扑优越的分割结果，避免了纯注意力模型的高昂扩展成本

Abstract: Achieving both high accuracy and topological continuity in road segmentation from satellite imagery is a critical goal for applications ranging from urban planning to disaster response. State-of-the-art methods often rely on Vision Transformers, which excel at capturing global context, yet their quadratic complexity is a significant barrier to efficient deployment, particularly for on-board processing in resource-constrained platforms. In contrast, emerging State Space Models like Mamba offer linear-time efficiency and are inherently suited to modeling long, continuous structures. We posit that these architectures have complementary strengths. To this end, we introduce PathMamba, a novel hybrid architecture that integrates Mamba's sequential modeling with the Transformer's global reasoning. Our design strategically uses Mamba blocks to trace the continuous nature of road networks, preserving topological structure, while integrating Transformer blocks to refine features with global context. This approach yields topologically superior segmentation maps without the prohibitive scaling costs of pure attention-based models. Our experiments on the DeepGlobe Road Extraction and Massachusetts Roads datasets demonstrate that PathMamba sets a new state-of-the-art. Notably, it significantly improves topological continuity, as measured by the APLS metric, setting a new benchmark while remaining computationally competitive.

TL;DR: CaliTex是一个解决3D纹理生成中跨视图不一致问题的框架，通过几何校准注意力机制确保纹理在不同视角下的对齐和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散模型的3D纹理生成系统存在跨视图不一致问题，即从一个视角看起来合理的纹理在其他视角下无法对齐。这源于注意力模糊问题，无结构的全注意力机制导致几何混乱和不稳定的外观-结构耦合。

Method: 引入CaliTex框架，包含两个模块：部分对齐注意力（强制语义匹配部分的空间对齐）和条件路由注意力（通过几何条件路径路由外观信息以保持空间保真度）。结合两阶段扩散变换器，使几何连贯性成为网络的固有行为。

Result: CaliTex能够生成无缝且视图一致的纹理，在实验中优于开源和商业基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过几何校准注意力机制，CaliTex有效解决了3D纹理生成中的跨视图不一致问题，使几何连贯性成为模型的内在特性。

Abstract: Despite major advances brought by diffusion-based models, current 3D texture generation systems remain hindered by cross-view inconsistency -- textures that appear convincing from one viewpoint often fail to align across others. We find that this issue arises from attention ambiguity, where unstructured full attention is applied indiscriminately across tokens and modalities, causing geometric confusion and unstable appearance-structure coupling. To address this, we introduce CaliTex, a framework of geometry-calibrated attention that explicitly aligns attention with 3D structure. It introduces two modules: Part-Aligned Attention that enforces spatial alignment across semantically matched parts, and Condition-Routed Attention which routes appearance information through geometry-conditioned pathways to maintain spatial fidelity. Coupled with a two-stage diffusion transformer, CaliTex makes geometric coherence an inherent behavior of the network rather than a byproduct of optimization. Empirically, CaliTex produces seamless and view-consistent textures and outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines.

Conclusion: 提出的频率感知token缩减策略有效平衡了计算效率和性能，同时分析了先前方法的隐含频率特性和局限性。

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated exceptional performance across various computer vision tasks, yet their quadratic computational complexity concerning token length remains a significant challenge. To address this, token reduction methods have been widely explored. However, existing approaches often overlook the frequency characteristics of self-attention, such as rank collapsing and over-smoothing phenomenon. In this paper, we propose a frequency-aware token reduction strategy that improves computational efficiency while preserving performance by mitigating rank collapsing. Our method partitions tokens into high-frequency tokens and low-frequency tokens. high-frequency tokens are selectively preserved, while low-frequency tokens are aggregated into a compact direct current token to retain essential low-frequency components. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves accuracy while reducing computational overhead and mitigating rank collapsing and over smoothing. Furthermore, we analyze the previous methods, shedding light on their implicit frequency characteristics and limitations.

Motivation: VGGT模型在重建大场景时，全局注意力机制导致长序列输入的显著延迟瓶颈，需要高效的加速方法。

Method: 提出头级时序合并(HTTM)，在多头粒度上合并token，利用空间局部性和时序对应性，保持特征独特性并降低合并成本。

Result: 在GPU推理中实现最高7倍加速，性能下降可忽略不计。

Conclusion: HTTM是首个针对VGGT的训练免费加速方法，通过多头粒度合并有效解决了现有方法导致特征同质化的问题。

Abstract: The Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) marks a significant leap forward in 3D scene reconstruction, as it is the first model that directly infers all key 3D attributes (camera poses, depths, and dense geometry) jointly in one pass. However, this joint inference mechanism requires global attention layers that perform all-to-all attention computation on tokens from all views. For reconstruction of large scenes with long-sequence inputs, this causes a significant latency bottleneck. In this paper, we propose head-wise temporal merging (HTTM), a training-free 3D token merging method for accelerating VGGT. Existing merging techniques merge tokens uniformly across different attention heads, resulting in identical tokens in the layers' output, which hinders the model's representational ability. HTTM tackles this problem by merging tokens in multi-head granularity, which preserves the uniqueness of feature tokens after head concatenation. Additionally, this enables HTTM to leverage the spatial locality and temporal correspondence observed at the head level to achieve higher merging ratios with lower merging costs compared to existing methods. Thus, HTTM achieves up to 7x acceleration with negligible performance drops in a GPU-based inference.

Result: 在标准CIL基准测试中表现出色，性能优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: M&B方法能有效减少灾难性遗忘，在类增量学习中实现卓越性能，且能无缝集成到现有CIL方法中。

Abstract: We present a novel training approach, named Merge-and-Bound (M&B) for Class Incremental Learning (CIL), which directly manipulates model weights in the parameter space for optimization. Our algorithm involves two types of weight merging: inter-task weight merging and intra-task weight merging. Inter-task weight merging unifies previous models by averaging the weights of models from all previous stages. On the other hand, intra-task weight merging facilitates the learning of current task by combining the model parameters within current stage. For reliable weight merging, we also propose a bounded update technique that aims to optimize the target model with minimal cumulative updates and preserve knowledge from previous tasks; this strategy reveals that it is possible to effectively obtain new models near old ones, reducing catastrophic forgetting. M&B is seamlessly integrated into existing CIL methods without modifying architecture components or revising learning objectives. We extensively evaluate our algorithm on standard CIL benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to learning-based 3D point cloud models, critically undermining their reliability in security-sensitive applications. Existing defense methods often suffer from (1) high computational overhead and (2) poor generalization ability across diverse attack types. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel yet efficient teacher-student framework, namely Multimodal Robust Prompt Distillation (MRPD) for distilling robust 3D point cloud model. It learns lightweight prompts by aligning student point cloud model's features with robust embeddings from three distinct teachers: a vision model processing depth projections, a high-performance 3D model, and a text encoder. To ensure a reliable knowledge transfer, this distillation is guided by a confidence-gated mechanism which dynamically balances the contribution of all input modalities. Notably, since the distillation is all during the training stage, there is no additional computational cost at inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRPD substantially outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods against a wide range of white-box and black-box attacks, while even achieving better performance on clean data. Our work presents a new, practical paradigm for building robust 3D vision systems by efficiently harnessing multimodal knowledge.

Abstract: Estimating the normal of a point requires constructing a local patch to provide center-surrounding context, but determining the appropriate neighborhood size is difficult when dealing with different data or geometries. Existing methods commonly employ various parameter-heavy strategies to extract a full feature description from the input patch. However, they still have difficulties in accurately and efficiently predicting normals for various point clouds. In this work, we present a new idea of feature extraction for robust normal estimation of point clouds. We use the fusion of multi-scale features from different neighborhood sizes to address the issue of selecting reasonable patch sizes for various data or geometries. We seek to model a patch feature fitting (PFF) based on multi-scale features to approximate the optimal geometric description for normal estimation and implement the approximation process via multi-scale feature aggregation and cross-scale feature compensation. The feature aggregation module progressively aggregates the patch features of different scales to the center of the patch and shrinks the patch size by removing points far from the center. It not only enables the network to precisely capture the structure characteristic in a wide range, but also describes highly detailed geometries. The feature compensation module ensures the reusability of features from earlier layers of large scales and reveals associated information in different patch sizes. Our approximation strategy based on aggregating the features of multiple scales enables the model to achieve scale adaptation of varying local patches and deliver the optimal feature description. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets with fewer network parameters and running time.

Abstract: We introduce Qwen3-VL, the most capable vision-language model in the Qwen series to date, achieving superior performance across a broad range of multimodal benchmarks. It natively supports interleaved contexts of up to 256K tokens, seamlessly integrating text, images, and video. The model family includes both dense (2B/4B/8B/32B) and mixture-of-experts (30B-A3B/235B-A22B) variants to accommodate diverse latency-quality trade-offs. Qwen3-VL delivers three core pillars: (i) markedly stronger pure-text understanding, surpassing comparable text-only backbones in several cases; (ii) robust long-context comprehension with a native 256K-token window for both text and interleaved multimodal inputs, enabling faithful retention, retrieval, and cross-referencing across long documents and videos; and (iii) advanced multimodal reasoning across single-image, multi-image, and video tasks, demonstrating leading performance on comprehensive evaluations such as MMMU and visual-math benchmarks (e.g., MathVista and MathVision). Architecturally, we introduce three key upgrades: (i) an enhanced interleaved-MRoPE for stronger spatial-temporal modeling across images and video; (ii) DeepStack integration, which effectively leverages multi-level ViT features to tighten vision-language alignment; and (iii) text-based time alignment for video, evolving from T-RoPE to explicit textual timestamp alignment for more precise temporal grounding. Under comparable token budgets and latency constraints, Qwen3-VL achieves superior performance in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We envision Qwen3-VL serving as a foundational engine for image-grounded reasoning, agentic decision-making, and multimodal code intelligence in real-world workflows.

Abstract: Endoscopic (endo) video exhibits strong view-dependent effects such as specularities, wet reflections, and occlusions. Pure photometric supervision misaligns with geometry and triggers early geometric drift, where erroneous shapes are reinforced during densification and become hard to correct. We ask how to anchor geometry early for 4D Gaussian splatting (4DGS) while maintaining temporal consistency and efficiency in dynamic endoscopic scenes. Thus, we present Endo-G$^{2}$T, a geometry-guided and temporally aware training scheme for time-embedded 4DGS. First, geo-guided prior distillation converts confidence-gated monocular depth into supervision with scale-invariant depth and depth-gradient losses, using a warm-up-to-cap schedule to inject priors softly and avoid early overfitting. Second, a time-embedded Gaussian field represents dynamics in XYZT with a rotor-like rotation parameterization, yielding temporally coherent geometry with lightweight regularization that favors smooth motion and crisp opacity boundaries. Third, keyframe-constrained streaming improves efficiency and long-horizon stability through keyframe-focused optimization under a max-points budget, while non-keyframes advance with lightweight updates. Across EndoNeRF and StereoMIS-P1 datasets, Endo-G$^{2}$T achieves state-of-the-art results among monocular reconstruction baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在资源受限设备上通过少样本学习纠正AI错误分类的系统，使用服务器端基础模型训练和设备端原型分类，实现高效错误纠正而无需模型重训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI模型在日常设备中广泛部署，但预测错误会降低用户体验。现有解决方案主要关注错误检测，缺乏高效的纠正机制，特别是在资源受限设备上。

Method: 系统包含两个关键组件：(1) 服务器端管道利用知识蒸馏将基础模型的鲁棒特征表示转移到设备兼容架构；(2) 设备端机制通过原型适配实现超高效错误纠正。

Result: 在Food-101和Flowers-102数据集上，单次场景下实现超过50%的错误纠正率，遗忘率低于0.02%，计算开销可忽略不计。通过Android演示应用验证了系统在实际场景中的实用性。

Conclusion: 该系统为资源受限设备提供了一种实用且高效的AI错误纠正解决方案，通过原型更新而非模型重训练的方式显著提升了用户体验。

Abstract: The proliferation of AI models in everyday devices has highlighted a critical challenge: prediction errors that degrade user experience. While existing solutions focus on error detection, they rarely provide efficient correction mechanisms, especially for resource-constrained devices. We present a novel system enabling users to correct AI misclassifications through few-shot learning, requiring minimal computational resources and storage. Our approach combines server-side foundation model training with on-device prototype-based classification, enabling efficient error correction through prototype updates rather than model retraining. The system consists of two key components: (1) a server-side pipeline that leverages knowledge distillation to transfer robust feature representations from foundation models to device-compatible architectures, and (2) a device-side mechanism that enables ultra-efficient error correction through prototype adaptation. We demonstrate our system's effectiveness on both image classification and object detection tasks, achieving over 50% error correction in one-shot scenarios on Food-101 and Flowers-102 datasets while maintaining minimal forgetting (less than 0.02%) and negligible computational overhead. Our implementation, validated through an Android demonstration app, proves the system's practicality in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: STVG-o1是首个无需架构修改就能让现成多模态大语言模型在时空视频定位任务上达到最先进性能的框架，通过边界框思维链机制和多维强化奖励函数实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在时空视频定位任务中表现不佳的问题，原因是训练目标不对齐和标准视觉编码器中细粒度区域-词对齐能力弱。

Method: 引入边界框思维链机制，在最终预测前显式推理时空位置；设计多维强化奖励函数，包括格式、一致性、时序、空间和思考奖励，通过强化微调提供几何感知监督。

Result: 在HCSTVG-v1/v2和VidSTG数据集上取得最先进结果，在HCSTVG-v1上比最佳任务特定方法提升7.3% m_tIoU，在VidSTG上与专用模型相当，大幅超越所有现有基于MLLM的方法。

Conclusion: STVG-o1证明了多模态大语言模型可以作为精确时空定位任务可行且强大的骨干网络，并展现出强大的跨数据集开放词汇泛化能力。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) requires localizing a target object in untrimmed videos both temporally and spatially from natural language descriptions. Despite their strong language understanding, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) underperform on STVG due to misaligned training objectives and weak fine-grained region-word alignment in standard visual encoders. To address this, we propose STVG-o1, the first framework that enables off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve state-of-the-art STVG performance without any architectural modifications. Our method introduces a bounding-box chain-of-thought mechanism that explicitly reasons about spatio-temporal locations in an intermediate step before producing the final prediction. We further design a multi-dimensional reinforcement reward function consisting of format, consistency, temporal, spatial, and think rewards, which provides geometry-aware supervision through reinforcement fine-tuning. Evaluated on HCSTVG-v1/v2 and VidSTG, STVG-o1 sets new state-of-the-art results on HCSTVG, outperforming the best task-specific method by 7.3\% m\_tIoU on HCSTVG-v1, matching specialized models on VidSTG, and surpassing all existing MLLM-based approaches by large margins. It also demonstrates strong open-vocabulary generalization across datasets, establishing MLLMs as viable and powerful backbones for precise spatio-temporal grounding. Our code and models will be released.

TL;DR: 提出ADVLA框架，通过在视觉编码器到文本特征空间的投影特征上直接应用对抗扰动，在低幅度约束下有效破坏VLA模型的下游动作预测，避免了传统补丁攻击的高训练成本和显著扰动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型的对抗攻击方法需要昂贵的端到端训练且通常生成明显的扰动补丁，需要解决这些限制。

Method: 在视觉编码器投影到文本特征空间的特征上直接应用对抗扰动，采用注意力引导使扰动既集中又稀疏，引入三种策略增强敏感性、强制稀疏性和集中扰动。

Result: 在L∞=4/255约束下，ADVLA结合Top-K掩码修改少于10%的补丁，攻击成功率接近100%，扰动集中在关键区域，整体图像几乎不可察觉，单步迭代仅需约0.06秒。

Conclusion: ADVLA在低幅度和局部稀疏条件下有效削弱VLA模型的下游动作预测，避免了传统补丁攻击的高训练成本和显著扰动，对攻击VLA特征空间具有独特有效性和实用价值。

Abstract: In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in embodied intelligence have developed rapidly. However, existing adversarial attack methods require costly end-to-end training and often generate noticeable perturbation patches. To address these limitations, we propose ADVLA, a framework that directly applies adversarial perturbations on features projected from the visual encoder into the textual feature space. ADVLA efficiently disrupts downstream action predictions under low-amplitude constraints, and attention guidance allows the perturbations to be both focused and sparse. We introduce three strategies that enhance sensitivity, enforce sparsity, and concentrate perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that under an $L_{\infty}=4/255$ constraint, ADVLA combined with Top-K masking modifies less than 10% of the patches while achieving an attack success rate of nearly 100%. The perturbations are concentrated on critical regions, remain almost imperceptible in the overall image, and a single-step iteration takes only about 0.06 seconds, significantly outperforming conventional patch-based attacks. In summary, ADVLA effectively weakens downstream action predictions of VLA models under low-amplitude and locally sparse conditions, avoiding the high training costs and conspicuous perturbations of traditional patch attacks, and demonstrates unique effectiveness and practical value for attacking VLA feature spaces.

TL;DR: DiverseVAR框架通过文本嵌入噪声注入和尺度旅行精炼技术，在不需重新训练或微调的情况下提升视觉自回归模型的多样性，同时在多样性和图像质量之间达到新的帕累托前沿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉自回归模型在图像质量方面表现出色，但在多样性方面存在严重不足，即使对于简单提示也会生成几乎相同的图像，这一问题在现有研究中被忽视。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1）在文本嵌入中注入噪声以增加多样性；2）提出尺度旅行精炼技术，利用多尺度自编码器提取粗尺度标记，在中间阶段恢复生成以保持图像质量。

Result: 结合文本嵌入噪声注入和尺度旅行精炼，显著提升了模型多样性，同时最小化了图像质量下降，在多样性和质量权衡中达到了新的帕累托最优。

Conclusion: DiverseVAR框架有效解决了视觉自回归模型的多样性不足问题，无需额外训练成本，为多样性和图像质量的平衡提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce DiverseVAR, a framework that enhances the diversity of text-conditioned visual autoregressive models (VAR) at test time without requiring retraining, fine-tuning, or substantial computational overhead. While VAR models have recently emerged as strong competitors to diffusion and flow models for image generation, they suffer from a critical limitation in diversity, often producing nearly identical images even for simple prompts. This issue has largely gone unnoticed amid the predominant focus on image quality. We address this limitation at test time in two stages. First, inspired by diversity enhancement techniques in diffusion models, we propose injecting noise into the text embedding. This introduces a trade-off between diversity and image quality: as diversity increases, the image quality sharply declines. To preserve quality, we propose scale-travel: a novel latent refinement technique inspired by time-travel strategies in diffusion models. Specifically, we use a multi-scale autoencoder to extract coarse-scale tokens that enable us to resume generation at intermediate stages. Extensive experiments show that combining text-embedding noise injection with our scale-travel refinement significantly enhances diversity while minimizing image-quality degradation, achieving a new Pareto frontier in the diversity-quality trade-off.

Motivation: 现有学习方法主要依赖几何特征，当几何信息不充分（如小碎片、侵蚀或对称碎片）时效果不佳，且缺乏防止重叠组装的物理约束。

Method: 使用旋转等变编码器提取几何特征，Transformer提取颜色特征，形成多模态表示，通过SE(3)流匹配预测变换参数。

Result: 在四个数据集上测试，在RePAIR数据集上相比竞争方法，旋转误差降低23.1%，平移误差降低13.2%，Chamfer距离减少18.4%。

Conclusion: 多模态特征结合和等变表示能显著提升3D重组性能，特别是在几何信息模糊的情况下。

Abstract: 3D reassembly is a fundamental geometric problem, and in recent years it has increasingly been challenged by deep learning methods rather than classical optimization. While learning approaches have shown promising results, most still rely primarily on geometric features to assemble a whole from its parts. As a result, methods struggle when geometry alone is insufficient or ambiguous, for example, for small, eroded, or symmetric fragments. Additionally, solutions do not impose physical constraints that explicitly prevent overlapping assemblies. To address these limitations, we introduce E-M3RF, an equivariant multimodal 3D reassembly framework that takes as input the point clouds, containing both point positions and colors of fractured fragments, and predicts the transformations required to reassemble them using SE(3) flow matching. Each fragment is represented by both geometric and color features: i) 3D point positions are encoded as rotationconsistent geometric features using a rotation-equivariant encoder, ii) the colors at each 3D point are encoded with a transformer. The two feature sets are then combined to form a multimodal representation. We experimented on four datasets: two synthetic datasets, Breaking Bad and Fantastic Breaks, and two real-world cultural heritage datasets, RePAIR and Presious, demonstrating that E-M3RF on the RePAIR dataset reduces rotation error by 23.1% and translation error by 13.2%, while Chamfer Distance decreases by 18.4% compared to competing methods.

Abstract: Recently, video generation has witnessed rapid advancements, drawing increasing attention to image-to-video (I2V) synthesis on mobile devices. However, the substantial computational complexity and slow generation speed of diffusion models pose significant challenges for real-time, high-resolution video generation on resource-constrained mobile devices. In this work, we propose MobileI2V, a 270M lightweight diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation on mobile devices. The core lies in: (1) We analyzed the performance of linear attention modules and softmax attention modules on mobile devices, and proposed a linear hybrid architecture denoiser that balances generation efficiency and quality. (2) We design a time-step distillation strategy that compresses the I2V sampling steps from more than 20 to only two without significant quality loss, resulting in a 10-fold increase in generation speed. (3) We apply mobile-specific attention optimizations that yield a 2-fold speed-up for attention operations during on-device inference. MobileI2V enables, for the first time, fast 720p image-to-video generation on mobile devices, with quality comparable to existing models. Under one-step conditions, the generation speed of each frame of 720p video is less than 100 ms. Our code is available at: https://github.com/hustvl/MobileI2V.

Motivation: 传统自注意力蒸馏方法独立对齐师生特征图，无法充分利用教师特征中的全局信息，需要更有效的非局部知识传递机制。

Method: 引入交叉注意力机制，让学生特征图的每个像素都能动态关注教师特征图的所有像素位置，仅通过额外的损失函数实现知识蒸馏。

Result: 在目标检测和图像分割任务上的大量实验表明，CanKD超越了现有的特征和混合蒸馏方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: CanKD作为注意力引导蒸馏的新范式，在计算机视觉任务中展现出巨大潜力，能够更有效地提升特征表示学习能力。

Abstract: We propose Cross-Attention-based Non-local Knowledge Distillation (CanKD), a novel feature-based knowledge distillation framework that leverages cross-attention mechanisms to enhance the knowledge transfer process. Unlike traditional self-attention-based distillation methods that align teacher and student feature maps independently, CanKD enables each pixel in the student feature map to dynamically consider all pixels in the teacher feature map. This non-local knowledge transfer more thoroughly captures pixel-wise relationships, improving feature representation learning. Our method introduces only an additional loss function to achieve superior performance compared with existing attention-guided distillation methods. Extensive experiments on object detection and image segmentation tasks demonstrate that CanKD outperforms state-of-the-art feature and hybrid distillation methods. These experimental results highlight CanKD's potential as a new paradigm for attention-guided distillation in computer vision tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/tori-hotaru/CanKD

Motivation: 深度伪造检测方法的有效性往往更多依赖于实现细节而非核心设计，这使得公平比较检测器变得困难。为了理解真正影响性能的因素，需要系统研究不同设计选择的影响。

Method: 通过系统调查不同设计选择对深度伪造检测模型准确性和泛化能力的影响，重点关注训练、推理和增量更新相关方面，隔离各个因素的影响。

Conclusion: 建立了稳健的、架构无关的最佳实践，为未来深度伪造检测系统的设计和开发提供指导。

Abstract: The effectiveness of deepfake detection methods often depends less on their core design and more on implementation details such as data preprocessing, augmentation strategies, and optimization techniques. These factors make it difficult to fairly compare detectors and to understand which factors truly contribute to their performance. To address this, we systematically investigate how different design choices influence the accuracy and generalization capabilities of deepfake detection models, focusing on aspects related to training, inference, and incremental updates. By isolating the impact of individual factors, we aim to establish robust, architecture-agnostic best practices for the design and development of future deepfake detection systems. Our experiments identify a set of design choices that consistently improve deepfake detection and enable state-of-the-art performance on the AI-GenBench benchmark.

<details>

Motivation: ANA检测对于诊断自身免疫疾病至关重要，但手动检测缓慢、劳动密集且需要多年训练。虽然机器学习和深度学习实现了自动化，但真实临床环境中的ANA检测涉及多实例多标签学习，面临独特挑战。

Method: 受人类标注逻辑启发，识别一致的ANA子区域并分配聚合标签。使用三个任务特定组件：实例采样器、概率伪标签分发器和自定步调权重学习率系数。实例采样器通过建模模式置信度抑制低置信度实例，分发器基于实例可区分性自适应分配标签，自定步调学习根据经验标签观察调整训练。

Result: 在ANA数据集上，模型比现有最佳方法提升7.0% F1-Macro和12.6% mAP，创下新的最先进结果。在三个公共医疗MIML基准测试中，所有关键指标均排名前2，汉明损失和单错误分别降低18.2%和26.9%。

Conclusion: 该框架克服了传统MIML方法的限制，支持端到端优化，在ANA检测和医疗MIML任务中表现出卓越性能。

Abstract: Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing is a crucial method for diagnosing autoimmune disorders, including lupus, Sjögren's syndrome, and scleroderma. Despite its importance, manual ANA detection is slow, labor-intensive, and demands years of training. ANA detection is complicated by over 100 coexisting antibody types, resulting in vast fluorescent pattern combinations. Although machine learning and deep learning have enabled automation, ANA detection in real-world clinical settings presents unique challenges as it involves multi-instance, multi-label (MIML) learning. In this paper, a novel framework for ANA detection is proposed that handles the complexities of MIML tasks using unaltered microscope images without manual preprocessing. Inspired by human labeling logic, it identifies consistent ANA sub-regions and assigns aggregated labels accordingly. These steps are implemented using three task-specific components: an instance sampler, a probabilistic pseudo-label dispatcher, and self-paced weight learning rate coefficients. The instance sampler suppresses low-confidence instances by modeling pattern confidence, while the dispatcher adaptively assigns labels based on instance distinguishability. Self-paced learning adjusts training according to empirical label observations. Our framework overcomes limitations of traditional MIML methods and supports end-to-end optimization. Extensive experiments on one ANA dataset and three public medical MIML benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework. On the ANA dataset, our model achieves up to +7.0% F1-Macro and +12.6% mAP gains over the best prior method, setting new state-of-the-art results. It also ranks top-2 across all key metrics on public datasets, reducing Hamming loss and one-error by up to 18.2% and 26.9%, respectively.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have shown great promise in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision, and similar efforts are now emerging in the Earth Observation community. These models aim to generalize across tasks with limited supervision, reducing the need for training separate models for each task. However, current strategies, which largely focus on scaling model size and dataset volume, require prohibitive computational and data resources, limiting accessibility to only a few large institutions. Moreover, this paradigm of ever-larger models stands in stark contrast with the principles of sustainable and environmentally responsible AI, as it leads to immense carbon footprints and resource inefficiency. In this work, we present a novel and efficient alternative: an Ensemble-of-Specialists framework for building Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs). Our method decomposes the training process into lightweight, task-specific ConvNeXtV2 specialists that can be frozen and reused. This modular approach offers strong advantages in efficiency, interpretability, and extensibility. Moreover, it naturally supports federated training, pruning, and continuous specialist integration, making it particularly well-suited for collaborative and resource-constrained settings. Our framework sets a new direction for building scalable and efficient RSFMs.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a debilitating disorder marked by a decline in cognitive function. Timely identification of the disease is essential for the development of personalized treatment strategies that aim to mitigate its progression. The application of generated images for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease poses challenges, particularly in accurately representing the disease's characteristics when input sequences are captured at irregular time intervals. This study presents an innovative methodology for sequential image generation, guided by quantitative metrics, to maintain the essential features indicative of disease progression. Furthermore, an age-scaling factor is integrated into the process to produce age-specific MRI images, facilitating the prediction of advanced stages of the disease. The results obtained from the ablation study suggest that the inclusion of quantitative metrics significantly improves the accuracy of MRI image synthesis. Furthermore, the application of age-scaled pixel loss contributed to the enhanced iterative generation of MRI images. In terms of long-term disease prognosis, the Structural Similarity Index reached a peak value of 0.882, indicating a substantial degree of similarity in the synthesized images.

Conclusion: 在潜在空间进行奖励反馈学习是视频生成对齐的有效方法，比像素空间方法更高效。

Abstract: Reward feedback learning (ReFL) has proven effective for aligning image generation with human preferences. However, its extension to video generation faces significant challenges. Existing video reward models rely on vision-language models designed for pixel-space inputs, confining ReFL optimization to near-complete denoising steps after computationally expensive VAE decoding. This pixel-space approach incurs substantial memory overhead and increased training time, and its late-stage optimization lacks early-stage supervision, refining only visual quality rather than fundamental motion dynamics and structural coherence. In this work, we show that pre-trained video generation models are naturally suited for reward modeling in the noisy latent space, as they are explicitly designed to process noisy latent representations at arbitrary timesteps and inherently preserve temporal information through their sequential modeling capabilities. Accordingly, we propose Process Reward Feedback Learning~(PRFL), a framework that conducts preference optimization entirely in latent space, enabling efficient gradient backpropagation throughout the full denoising chain without VAE decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRFL significantly improves alignment with human preferences, while achieving substantial reductions in memory consumption and training time compared to RGB ReFL.

Conclusion: 该数据集为光照鲁棒的3D重建方法提供了可靠的评估基础，解决了现有数据集的局限性。

Abstract: Illumination inconsistency is a fundamental challenge in multi-view 3D reconstruction. Variations in sunlight direction, cloud cover, and shadows break the constant-lighting assumption underlying both classical multi-view stereo (MVS) and structure from motion (SfM) pipelines and recent neural rendering methods, leading to geometry drift, color inconsistency, and shadow imprinting. This issue is especially critical in UAV-based reconstruction, where long flight durations and outdoor environments make lighting changes unavoidable. However, existing datasets either restrict capture to short time windows, thus lacking meaningful illumination diversity, or span months and seasons, where geometric and semantic changes confound the isolated study of lighting robustness. We introduce UAVLight, a controlled-yet-real benchmark for illumination-robust 3D reconstruction. Each scene is captured along repeatable, geo-referenced flight paths at multiple fixed times of day, producing natural lighting variation under consistent geometry, calibration, and viewpoints. With standardized evaluation protocols across lighting conditions, UAVLight provides a reliable foundation for developing and benchmarking reconstruction methods that are consistent, faithful, and relightable in real outdoor environments.

Abstract: Automated landmark detection offers an efficient approach for medical professionals to understand patient anatomic structure and positioning using intra-operative imaging. While current detection methods for pelvic fluoroscopy demonstrate promising accuracy, most assume a fixed Antero-Posterior view of the pelvis. However, orientation often deviates from this standard view, either due to repositioning of the imaging unit or of the target structure itself. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that incorporates 2D/3D landmark registration into the training of a U-Net landmark prediction model. We analyze the performance difference by comparing landmark detection accuracy between the baseline U-Net, U-Net trained with Pose Estimation Loss, and U-Net fine-tuned with Pose Estimation Loss under realistic intra-operative conditions where patient pose is variable.

TL;DR: Harmony是一个解决音频-视频同步生成挑战的新框架，通过跨任务协同训练、全局-局部解耦交互模块和同步增强CFG，显著提升了生成保真度和细粒度同步效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源模型在音频-视频同步方面存在挑战，主要源于联合扩散过程的三个根本问题：对应漂移、低效的全局注意力机制和传统CFG的模态内偏差

Method: 提出跨任务协同训练范式缓解漂移，设计全局-局部解耦交互模块实现高效时序对齐，开发同步增强CFG在推理时显式增强对齐信号

Result: 大量实验证明Harmony在生成保真度和细粒度音频-视频同步方面显著优于现有方法，建立了新的最先进水平

Conclusion: Harmony框架通过机制化强制音频-视频同步，有效解决了联合扩散过程中的根本挑战，为同步音频-视觉内容合成提供了强大解决方案

Abstract: The synthesis of synchronized audio-visual content is a key challenge in generative AI, with open-source models facing challenges in robust audio-video alignment. Our analysis reveals that this issue is rooted in three fundamental challenges of the joint diffusion process: (1) Correspondence Drift, where concurrently evolving noisy latents impede stable learning of alignment; (2) inefficient global attention mechanisms that fail to capture fine-grained temporal cues; and (3) the intra-modal bias of conventional Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which enhances conditionality but not cross-modal synchronization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Harmony, a novel framework that mechanistically enforces audio-visual synchronization. We first propose a Cross-Task Synergy training paradigm to mitigate drift by leveraging strong supervisory signals from audio-driven video and video-driven audio generation tasks. Then, we design a Global-Local Decoupled Interaction Module for efficient and precise temporal-style alignment. Finally, we present a novel Synchronization-Enhanced CFG (SyncCFG) that explicitly isolates and amplifies the alignment signal during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Harmony establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in both generation fidelity and, critically, in achieving fine-grained audio-visual synchronization.

Motivation: 口腔癌在全球非常常见，由于口腔内良性、癌前和恶性病变在视觉上相似，多数在晚期才被诊断。早期实施计算机辅助诊断系统可显著改善临床结果。

Method: 结合分层数据分割、高级数据增强和过采样技术，构建深度学习多分类器来处理有限且不平衡的数据集。

Result: 实验结果显示83.33%的准确率、89.12%的精确率和77.31%的召回率，优于现有最先进方法，在少数类分类方面表现显著。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了过采样和增强策略在数据不平衡情况下的有效性，是构建可信赖口腔癌早期检测计算机辅助诊断系统的第一步。

Abstract: Oral cancer is highly common across the globe and is mostly diagnosed during the later stages due to the close visual similarity to benign, precancerous, and malignant lesions in the oral cavity. Implementing computer aided diagnosis systems early on has the potential to greatly improve clinical outcomes. This research intends to use deep learning to build a multiclass classifier for sixteen different oral lesions. To overcome the challenges of limited and imbalanced datasets, the proposed technique combines stratified data splitting and advanced data augmentation and oversampling to perform the classification. The experimental results, which achieved 83.33 percent accuracy, 89.12 percent precision, and 77.31 percent recall, demonstrate the superiority of the suggested model over state of the art methods now in use. The suggested model effectively conveys the effectiveness of oversampling and augmentation strategies in situations where the minority class classification performance is noteworthy. As a first step toward trustworthy computer aided diagnostic systems for the early detection of oral cancer in clinical settings, the suggested framework shows promise.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoGAN是一个专注于提升视频生成运动质量的训练后框架，通过光学流判别器和分布匹配正则化器来改善运动真实感，无需奖励模型或人类偏好数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频扩散模型在帧级保真度上表现良好，但在运动连贯性、动态性和真实感方面存在不足，常产生抖动、重影或不合理的动态。标准去噪MSE目标缺乏对时间一致性的直接监督。

Method: 基于3步蒸馏视频扩散模型，训练基于DiT的光学流判别器来区分真实与生成的运动，结合分布匹配正则化器保持视觉保真度。

Result: 在VBench上，MoGAN比50步教师模型提升运动得分7.3%，比3步DMD模型提升13.3%；在VideoJAM-Bench上分别提升7.4%和8.8%，同时保持或改善美学和图像质量得分。人类研究显示MoGAN在运动质量上更受偏好。

Conclusion: MoGAN在不牺牲视觉保真度或效率的前提下，显著提升了运动真实感，为快速高质量视频生成提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Video diffusion models achieve strong frame-level fidelity but still struggle with motion coherence, dynamics and realism, often producing jitter, ghosting, or implausible dynamics. A key limitation is that the standard denoising MSE objective provides no direct supervision on temporal consistency, allowing models to achieve low loss while still generating poor motion. We propose MoGAN, a motion-centric post-training framework that improves motion realism without reward models or human preference data. Built atop a 3-step distilled video diffusion model, we train a DiT-based optical-flow discriminator to differentiate real from generated motion, combined with a distribution-matching regularizer to preserve visual fidelity. With experiments on Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B, MoGAN substantially improves motion quality across benchmarks. On VBench, MoGAN boosts motion score by +7.3% over the 50-step teacher and +13.3% over the 3-step DMD model. On VideoJAM-Bench, MoGAN improves motion score by +7.4% over the teacher and +8.8% over DMD, while maintaining comparable or even better aesthetic and image-quality scores. A human study further confirms that MoGAN is preferred for motion quality (52% vs. 38% for the teacher; 56% vs. 29% for DMD). Overall, MoGAN delivers significantly more realistic motion without sacrificing visual fidelity or efficiency, offering a practical path toward fast, high-quality video generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自提示、点监督的框架，使用稀疏点标注将SAM适配到遥感图像，通过Refine-Requery-Reinforce循环逐步提升分割质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM在自然图像上表现优异，但在遥感图像上由于严重的领域偏移和密集标注稀缺而表现欠佳，需要一种高效的领域适配方法。

Method: 采用Refine-Requery-Reinforce循环：从初始点生成粗伪掩码（Refine），用自构建的框提示改进（Requery），通过嵌入对齐减少确认偏差（Reinforce）。

Result: 在WHU、HRSID和NWPU VHR-10三个遥感基准数据集上，该方法持续超越预训练SAM和最近的点监督分割方法。

Conclusion: 自提示和语义对齐为遥感应用中基础分割模型的可扩展点级适配提供了高效路径。

Abstract: Interactive segmentation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have demonstrated remarkable generalization on natural images, but perform suboptimally on remote sensing imagery (RSI) due to severe domain shift and the scarcity of dense annotations. To address this, we propose a self-prompting, point-supervised framework that adapts SAM to RSIs using only sparse point annotations. Our method employs a Refine-Requery-Reinforce loop, where coarse pseudo-masks are generated from initial points (Refine), improved with self-constructed box prompts (Requery), and embeddings are aligned across iterations to reduce confirmation bias (Reinforce). Without relying on full-mask supervision, our approach progressively enhances SAM's segmentation quality and domain robustness through self-guided prompt adaptation . We evaluate our proposed method on three RSI benchmark datasets, including WHU, HRSID, and NWPU VHR-10, showing that our method consistently surpasses pretrained SAM and recent point-supervised segmentation methods. Our results demonstrate that self-prompting and semantic alignment provide an efficient path towards scalable, point-level adaptation of foundation segmentation models for remote sensing applications.

Result: 在两个具有挑战性的骨架动作识别基准测试中，与先前工作相比取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 所提出的标签高效GCN模型能够有效解决标注数据稀缺问题，在骨架动作识别任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Despite the notable success of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in skeleton-based action recognition, their performance often depends on large volumes of labeled data, which are frequently scarce in practical settings. To address this limitation, we propose a novel label-efficient GCN model. Our work makes two primary contributions. First, we develop a novel acquisition function that employs an adversarial strategy to identify a compact set of informative exemplars for labeling. This selection process balances representativeness, diversity, and uncertainty. Second, we introduce bidirectional and stable GCN architectures. These enhanced networks facilitate a more effective mapping between the ambient and latent data spaces, enabling a better understanding of the learned exemplar distribution. Extensive evaluations on two challenging skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks reveal significant improvements achieved by our label-efficient GCNs compared to prior work.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaFlow是一个用于长时动作质量评估的统一框架，结合了反事实解耦和双向时间条件流，通过自监督方式分离因果特征和混杂特征，并利用双向时序建模提升长期表示的稳定性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长时动作质量评估（如花样滑冰、艺术体操）面临两个主要挑战：需要建模长期时序动态，同时要抵抗上下文混杂因素的干扰。现有方法要么依赖昂贵标注，要么使用单向时序建模，容易受到虚假相关性和不稳定长期表示的影响。

Method: 提出CaFlow框架，包含两个核心模块：1）因果反事实正则化（CCR）模块：自监督解耦因果特征和混杂特征，通过反事实干预增强因果鲁棒性；2）BiT-Flow模块：建模前向和后向动态，通过循环一致性约束产生更平滑连贯的表示。

Result: 在多个长时AQA基准测试上的广泛实验表明，CaFlow达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CaFlow通过整合反事实解耦和双向时序建模，有效解决了长时动作质量评估中的时序动态建模和混杂因素干扰问题，为复杂动作评估提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) predicts fine-grained execution scores from action videos and is widely applied in sports, rehabilitation, and skill evaluation. Long-term AQA, as in figure skating or rhythmic gymnastics, is especially challenging since it requires modeling extended temporal dynamics while remaining robust to contextual confounders. Existing approaches either depend on costly annotations or rely on unidirectional temporal modeling, making them vulnerable to spurious correlations and unstable long-term representations. To this end, we propose CaFlow, a unified framework that integrates counterfactual de-confounding with bidirectional time-conditioned flow. The Causal Counterfactual Regularization (CCR) module disentangles causal and confounding features in a self-supervised manner and enforces causal robustness through counterfactual interventions, while the BiT-Flow module models forward and backward dynamics with a cycle-consistency constraint to produce smoother and more coherent representations. Extensive experiments on multiple long-term AQA benchmarks demonstrate that CaFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at https://github.com/Harrison21/CaFlow

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型多模态模型越来越多地被用作多模态评估系统的评判者，但它们遵循多样化、细粒度评估标准的能力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 通过严格的数据筛选流程构建Multi-Crit基准，收集具有多标准人工标注的挑战性响应对，并引入三个新指标来系统评估多元标准遵循、标准切换灵活性和识别标准级偏好冲突的能力。

Result: 对25个LMM的综合分析显示：1) 专有模型在遵循多元标准方面仍存在困难，特别是在开放式评估中；2) 开源模型在灵活遵循多样化标准方面进一步落后；3) 使用整体判断信号进行批评微调增强了视觉基础能力，但无法泛化到多元标准级判断。

Conclusion: Multi-Crit为构建可靠且可操控的多模态AI评估奠定了基础，揭示了当前多模态评判者的局限性。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) are increasingly adopted as judges in multimodal evaluation systems due to their strong instruction following and consistency with human preferences. However, their ability to follow diverse, fine-grained evaluation criteria remains underexplored. We develop Multi-Crit, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal judges on their capacity to follow pluralistic criteria and produce reliable criterion-level judgments. Covering both open-ended generation and verifiable reasoning tasks, Multi-Crit is built through a rigorous data curation pipeline that gathers challenging response pairs with multi-criterion human annotations. It further introduces three novel metrics for systematically assessing pluralistic adherence, criterion-switching flexibility, and the ability to recognize criterion-level preference conflicts. Comprehensive analysis of 25 LMMs reveals that 1) proprietary models still struggle to maintain consistent adherence to pluralistic criteria--especially in open-ended evaluation; 2) open-source models lag further behind in flexibly following diverse criteria; and 3) critic fine-tuning with holistic judgment signals enhances visual grounding but fails to generalize to pluralistic criterion-level judgment. Additional analyses on reasoning fine-tuning, test-time scaling, and boundary consistency between open-source and proprietary models further probe the limits of current multimodal judges. As a pioneering study, Multi-Crit lays the foundation for building reliable and steerable multimodal AI evaluation.

Motivation: 胶质瘤是具有高死亡率的脑肿瘤类型，早期准确诊断对于治疗干预至关重要，需要开发能够精确分割和分类肿瘤的深度学习模型。

Method: 开发了混合深度学习框架：使用U-Net进行3D MRI数据中的肿瘤分割，结合DenseNet和VGG的混合分类网络，集成多头注意力和空间通道注意力机制，通过预处理步骤（归一化、重采样、数据增强）处理高维3D MRI数据。

Conclusion: 该框架在促进胶质瘤及时可靠诊断和分级方面具有巨大潜力，有助于改善患者治疗规划。

Abstract: Gliomas are brain tumor types that have a high mortality rate which means early and accurate diagnosis is important for therapeutic intervention for the tumors. To address this difficulty, the proposed research will develop a hybrid deep learning model which integrates U-Net based segmentation and a hybrid DenseNet-VGG classification network with multihead attention and spatial-channel attention capabilities. The segmentation model will precisely demarcate the tumors in a 3D volume of MRI data guided by spatial and contextual information. The classification network which combines a branch of both DenseNet and VGG, will incorporate the demarcated tumor on which features with attention mechanisms would be focused on clinically relevant features. High-dimensional 3D MRI data could successfully be utilized in the model through preprocessing steps which are normalization, resampling, and data augmentation. Through a variety of measures the framework is evaluated: measures of performance in segmentation are Dice coefficient and Mean Intersection over Union (IoU) and measures of performance in classification are accuracy precision, recall, and F1-score. The hybrid framework that has been proposed has demonstrated through physical testing that it has the capability of obtaining a Dice coefficient of 98% in tumor segmentation, and 99% on classification accuracy, outperforming traditional CNN models and attention-free methods. Utilizing multi-head attention mechanisms enhances notions of priority in aspects of the tumor that are clinically significant, and enhances interpretability and accuracy. The results suggest a great potential of the framework in facilitating the timely and reliable diagnosis and grading of glioma by clinicians is promising, allowing for better planning of patient treatment.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Can one perceive a video's content without seeing its pixels, just from the camera trajectory-the path it carves through space? This paper is the first to systematically investigate this seemingly implausible question. Towards this end, we propose a contrastive learning framework to train CamFormer, a dedicated encoder that projects camera pose trajectories into a joint embedding space, aligning them with natural language. We find that, contrary to its apparent simplicity, the camera trajectory is a remarkably informative signal to uncover video content. In other words, "how you move" can indeed reveal "what you are doing" (egocentric) or "observing" (exocentric). We demonstrate the versatility of our learned CamFormer embeddings on a diverse suite of downstream tasks, ranging from cross-modal alignment to classification and temporal analysis. Importantly, our representations are robust across diverse camera pose estimation methods, including both high-fidelity multi-sensored and standard RGB-only estimators. Our findings establish camera trajectory as a lightweight, robust, and versatile modality for perceiving video content.

Motivation: 现代扩散模型在生成高质量多样化图像方面表现出色，但在处理高保真度的组合和多模态控制方面仍有困难，特别是当用户同时指定文本提示、主体参考、空间排列、姿态约束和布局标注时。

Method: 将多种控制信号编码为单一复合画布图像，通过多任务画布训练策略优化扩散模型，使其能够联合理解和整合异构控制信号到文本到图像生成中。

Result: 在具有挑战性的基准测试中，包括多人组合、姿态控制组合、布局约束生成和多控制生成，Canvas-to-Image在身份保持和控制遵循方面显著优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: Canvas-to-Image通过统一学习范式实现了跨多个控制模态的推理，在推理过程中能够很好地泛化到多控制场景，提供了更忠实反映用户意图的图像生成能力。

Abstract: While modern diffusion models excel at generating high-quality and diverse images, they still struggle with high-fidelity compositional and multimodal control, particularly when users simultaneously specify text prompts, subject references, spatial arrangements, pose constraints, and layout annotations. We introduce Canvas-to-Image, a unified framework that consolidates these heterogeneous controls into a single canvas interface, enabling users to generate images that faithfully reflect their intent. Our key idea is to encode diverse control signals into a single composite canvas image that the model can directly interpret for integrated visual-spatial reasoning. We further curate a suite of multi-task datasets and propose a Multi-Task Canvas Training strategy that optimizes the diffusion model to jointly understand and integrate heterogeneous controls into text-to-image generation within a unified learning paradigm. This joint training enables Canvas-to-Image to reason across multiple control modalities rather than relying on task-specific heuristics, and it generalizes well to multi-control scenarios during inference. Extensive experiments show that Canvas-to-Image significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity preservation and control adherence across challenging benchmarks, including multi-person composition, pose-controlled composition, layout-constrained generation, and multi-control generation.

TL;DR: 论文主张LLM效率研究应从追求大规模复杂技术转向注重在有限资源和专业知识下的稳健简单性，提出了包括模型架构改造、轻量微调、经济推理等新研究方向，以促进LLM部署的民主化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的LLM效率方法（如MoE、推测解码、复杂RAG）主要服务于拥有庞大基础设施的科技巨头，而在普通机构中这些方法反而带来额外开销和脆弱性，加剧了技术不平等和碳浪费问题。

Method: 提出新的研究议程：在不重新训练的情况下改造预训练模型架构、开发保持对齐的轻量微调、实现经济的长链推理、构建无需重型RAG管道的动态知识管理，并采用开销感知效率作为标准基准。

Result: 通过重新定义效率概念，使其包含采用成本、可持续性和公平性，可以推动LLM部署的民主化。

Conclusion: LLM效率研究应转向关注在有限资源下的稳健简单性，通过降低采用门槛来减少不平等和碳浪费，而非放大这些问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable, but the most celebrated efficiency methods -- mixture-of-experts (MoE), speculative decoding, and complex retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) -- were built for hyperscale providers with vast infrastructure and elite teams. Outside that context, their benefits collapse into overhead, fragility, and wasted carbon. The result is that a handful of Big Tech companies benefit, while thousands of hospitals, schools, governments, and enterprises are left without viable options. We argue that the next frontier is not greater sophistication at scale, but robust simplicity: efficiency that thrives under modest resources and minimal expertise. We propose a new research agenda: retrofitting pretrained models with more efficient architectures without retraining, inventing lightweight fine-tuning that preserves alignment, making reasoning economical despite long chains of thought, enabling dynamic knowledge management without heavy RAG pipelines, and adopting Overhead-Aware Efficiency (OAE) as a standard benchmark. By redefining efficiency to include adoption cost, sustainability, and fairness, we can democratize LLM deployment -- ensuring that optimization reduces inequality and carbon waste rather than amplifying them.

Motivation: 开发一种不依赖统计共现或优化的透明、高效文本嵌入方法，提供可解释的离散符号到连续向量空间的映射。

Method: 使用谐波标记投影(HTP)，将每个标记的Unicode整数表示解析为谐波轨迹，建立双射和可解释的映射，保持结构和可逆性。

Result: 在STS-B及其多语言扩展上，HTP在英语中达到Spearman相关性ρ=0.68，在十种语言中保持稳定性能，计算成本极低，每句对延迟低于毫秒。

Conclusion: 有意义的语义关系可以从确定性几何中产生，HTP为数据驱动嵌入提供了透明且高效的替代方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Harmonic Token Projection (HTP), a reversible and deterministic framework for generating text embeddings without training, vocabularies, or stochastic parameters. Unlike neural embeddings that rely on statistical co-occurrence or optimization, HTP encodes each token analytically as a harmonic trajectory derived from its Unicode integer representation, establishing a bijective and interpretable mapping between discrete symbols and continuous vector space. The harmonic formulation provides phase-coherent projections that preserve both structure and reversibility, enabling semantic similarity estimation from purely geometric alignment. Experimental evaluation on the Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark (STS-B) and its multilingual extension shows that HTP achieves a Spearman correlation of \r{ho} = 0.68 in English, maintaining stable performance across ten languages with negligible computational cost and sub-millisecond latency per sentence pair. This demonstrates that meaningful semantic relations can emerge from deterministic geometry, offering a transparent and efficient alternative to data-driven embeddings. Keywords: Harmonic Token Projection, reversible embedding, deterministic encoding, semantic similarity, multilingual representation.

Conclusion: 该方法适合生产ITSM环境，在保持性能的同时显著提升了可解释性和操作效率。

Abstract: Text classification with hierarchical taxonomies is a fundamental requirement in IT Service Management (ITSM) systems, where support tickets must be categorized into tree-structured taxonomies. We present a dual-embedding centroid-based classification framework that maintains separate semantic and lexical centroid representations per category, combining them through reciprocal rank fusion at inference time. The framework achieves performance competitive with Support Vector Machines (hierarchical F1: 0.731 vs 0.727) while providing interpretability through centroid representations. Evaluated on 8,968 ITSM tickets across 123 categories, this method achieves 5.9 times faster training and up to 152 times faster incremental updates. With 8.6-8.8 times speedup across batch sizes (100-1000 samples) when excluding embedding computation. These results make the method suitable for production ITSM environments prioritizing interpretability and operational efficiency.

Abstract: Reward models are crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences but face two representative challenges. First, traditional discriminative reward models usually concatenate questions and responses directly as input, resulting in low data efficiency. Second, reward models are vulnerable to reward overoptimization. We propose PIRA, a training paradigm addressing these issues through three strategies: (1) Reformulating question-answer pairs into preference-based instructions for clearer and more explicit task specification, (2) aggregating rewards from diverse preference tasks to reduce bias and improve robustness, and (3) averaging value-head outputs under varying dropout rates to stabilize rewards. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of PIRA.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了如何通过重组法律文档结构、定义修辞角色和模拟法庭推理步骤来提升LLMs在法律任务中的表现，在零样本设置下实现了1.5%-4.36%的F1分数提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在通用推理方面表现出色，但在法律等专业领域表现不佳，主要因为缺乏领域特定的预训练。法律文档通常冗长复杂，模型难以有效处理全文。

Method: 在三个印度法律判决预测数据集上进行零样本实验：(1)基于修辞角色重组文档结构；(2)定义修辞角色让模型熟悉法律术语；(3)模拟法庭关于修辞角色的逐步推理过程。

Result: 重组数据或解释关键法律术语显著提升了模型性能，与基线相比F1分数最低提高约1.5%，最高提高4.36%。

Conclusion: 通过结构化信息处理和领域特定知识注入，可以有效提升LLMs在法律领域的表现，即使在没有领域对齐的情况下。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on extensive datasets from the web, exhibit remarkable general reasoning skills. Despite this, they often struggle in specialized areas like law, mainly because they lack domain-specific pretraining. The legal field presents unique challenges, as legal documents are generally long and intricate, making it hard for models to process the full text efficiently. Previous studies have examined in-context approaches to address the knowledge gap, boosting model performance in new domains without full domain alignment. In our paper, we analyze model behavior on legal tasks by conducting experiments in three areas: (i) reorganizing documents based on rhetorical roles to assess how structured information affects long context processing and model decisions, (ii) defining rhetorical roles to familiarize the model with legal terminology, and (iii) emulating the step-by-step reasoning of courts regarding rhetorical roles to enhance model reasoning. These experiments are conducted in a zero-shot setting across three Indian legal judgment prediction datasets. Our results reveal that organizing data or explaining key legal terms significantly boosts model performance, with a minimum increase of ~1.5% and a maximum improvement of 4.36% in F1 score compared to the baseline.

TL;DR: MindSET是一个新的心理健康分析基准数据集，包含1300万条来自Reddit的标注帖子，涵盖7种心理健康状况，通过严格预处理确保数据质量，在诊断检测任务中表现优于现有基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心理健康分析基准数据集已过时，存在数据量有限、清洗不足、内容多样性不足等问题，需要构建更全面、高质量的数据集来支持社交媒体心理健康研究。

Method: 从Reddit收集自报告诊断数据，应用严格预处理（语言过滤、NSFW内容移除、去重），使用LIWC进行语言分析，并通过微调语言模型和词袋特征进行二元分类实验。

Result: MindSET数据集规模是之前基准的两倍以上，在自闭症检测任务中F1分数提升高达18个百分点，模型在MindSET上的表现始终优于在先前基准上的表现。

Conclusion: MindSET为社交媒体与心理健康交叉研究提供了坚实基础，支持早期风险检测和新兴心理趋势的深入分析。

Abstract: Social media data has become a vital resource for studying mental health, offering real-time insights into thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that traditional methods often miss. Progress in this area has been facilitated by benchmark datasets for mental health analysis; however, most existing benchmarks have become outdated due to limited data availability, inadequate cleaning, and the inherently diverse nature of social media content (e.g., multilingual and harmful material). We present a new benchmark dataset, \textbf{MindSET}, curated from Reddit using self-reported diagnoses to address these limitations. The annotated dataset contains over \textbf{13M} annotated posts across seven mental health conditions, more than twice the size of previous benchmarks. To ensure data quality, we applied rigorous preprocessing steps, including language filtering, and removal of Not Safe for Work (NSFW) and duplicate content. We further performed a linguistic analysis using LIWC to examine psychological term frequencies across the eight groups represented in the dataset. To demonstrate the dataset utility, we conducted binary classification experiments for diagnosis detection using both fine-tuned language models and Bag-of-Words (BoW) features. Models trained on MindSET consistently outperformed those trained on previous benchmarks, achieving up to an \textbf{18-point} improvement in F1 for Autism detection. Overall, MindSET provides a robust foundation for researchers exploring the intersection of social media and mental health, supporting both early risk detection and deeper analysis of emerging psychological trends.

TL;DR: FlexCode是一个面向生成式推荐系统的流行度感知框架，通过自适应分配CF代码本和语义代码本的token预算，解决传统方法使用单一代码本无法平衡热门项目和长尾项目表示的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式推荐方法使用单一代码本编码所有项目，忽视了热门项目（富含协同过滤信号）和长尾项目（依赖语义理解）之间的内在不平衡，这限制了表示效率和泛化能力。

Method: 提出FlexCode框架：1）自适应分配固定token预算给CF代码本和语义代码本；2）使用轻量级MoE动态平衡CF精度和语义泛化；3）通过对齐和平滑目标保持流行度谱系的一致性。

Result: 在公共和工业规模数据集上的实验表明，FlexCode持续优于强基线方法，在准确性和长尾鲁棒性方面表现更优。

Conclusion: FlexCode为生成式推荐器中的token表示提供了新机制，实现了更强的准确性和尾部鲁棒性，为基于token的推荐模型中平衡记忆和泛化提供了新视角。

Abstract: Generative recommendation has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm that unifies retrieval and generation, representing items as discrete semantic tokens and enabling flexible sequence modeling with autoregressive models. Despite its success, existing approaches rely on a single, uniform codebook to encode all items, overlooking the inherent imbalance between popular items rich in collaborative signals and long-tail items that depend on semantic understanding. We argue that this uniform treatment limits representational efficiency and hinders generalization. To address this, we introduce FlexCode, a popularity-aware framework that adaptively allocates a fixed token budget between a collaborative filtering (CF) codebook and a semantic codebook. A lightweight MoE dynamically balances CF-specific precision and semantic generalization, while an alignment and smoothness objective maintains coherence across the popularity spectrum. We perform experiments on both public and industrial-scale datasets, showing that FlexCode consistently outperform strong baselines. FlexCode provides a new mechanism for token representation in generative recommenders, achieving stronger accuracy and tail robustness, and offering a new perspective on balancing memorization and generalization in token-based recommendation models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的text-to-SQL研究主要集中在英语和中文，阿拉伯语领域尚未有相关工作。本文旨在填补这一空白，为阿拉伯语用户提供与数据库自然语言交互的能力。

Method: 构建了Ar-SParC数据集，包含3,450个相关问题序列；使用GPT-3.5-turbo和GPT-4.5-turbo模型，应用10种提示工程技术；开发了GAT corrector方法提升性能。

Result: GAT corrector在40个实验中平均提升了1.9%的执行准确率和1.9%的交互准确率（零样本设置），以及1.72%执行准确率和0.92%交互准确率（上下文学习设置）。

Conclusion: 成功创建了首个阿拉伯语text-to-SQL数据集，提出的GAT corrector方法有效提升了模型性能，为阿拉伯语自然语言数据库交互提供了重要基础。

Abstract: In recent years, the task of cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL has received significant attention. Enables users with no prior knowledge of SQL to have a conversation with databases using natural language. However, most of the available datasets and research have been conducted in English, along with some work in Chinese. To this date, no effort has been made to address this task in the Arabic language. In this paper, we introduce Ar-SParC, the first Arabic cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL dataset. The dataset consists of 3,450 sequences of interrelated questions, each sequence containing an average of approximately three questions, which results in a total of 10225 questions along with their corresponding SQL queries. We conducted 40 experiments on the Ar-SParC dataset using two large language models, GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4.5-turbo, applying 10 different prompt engineering techniques, including four question representation methods and six in-context learning techniques. Furthermore, we developed a novel approach named GAT corrector, which enhanced the performance across all 40 experiments, yielding an average improvement of 1.9% in execution accuracy (EX) and 1.9% in interaction accuracy (IX) under zero-shot settings, and an average increase of 1.72% EX and 0.92% IX under in-context learning settings. Finally, we conducted an ablation study with two more experiments to explain why the GAT corrector outperformed the previous GAT verifier technique, particularly for the Arabic language.

Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在临床基准测试中表现良好，但它们可能通过错误推理得出正确结论，这种故障模式在肿瘤学决策支持中具有安全影响，而基于准确性的评估无法捕捉到这一点。

Method: 开发了三级分类法，从GPT-4对真实肿瘤学笔记的思维链响应中标注推理错误，并在前列腺癌咨询笔记上验证该分类法，模拟提取、分析和临床建议任务。

Result: 23%的解释中出现推理错误，确认偏误和锚定偏误最常见。推理失败与指南不一致和潜在有害建议相关，特别是在晚期疾病管理中。自动评估器能检测错误存在但无法可靠分类子类型。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在推理存在缺陷时可能提供流畅但临床不安全的建议。该分类法为临床部署前评估和改进推理保真度提供了可推广的框架。

Abstract: Despite high performance on clinical benchmarks, large language models may reach correct conclusions through faulty reasoning, a failure mode with safety implications for oncology decision support that is not captured by accuracy-based evaluation. In this two-cohort retrospective study, we developed a hierarchical taxonomy of reasoning errors from GPT-4 chain-of-thought responses to real oncology notes and tested its clinical relevance. Using breast and pancreatic cancer notes from the CORAL dataset, we annotated 600 reasoning traces to define a three-tier taxonomy mapping computational failures to cognitive bias frameworks. We validated the taxonomy on 822 responses from prostate cancer consult notes spanning localized through metastatic disease, simulating extraction, analysis, and clinical recommendation tasks. Reasoning errors occurred in 23 percent of interpretations and dominated overall errors, with confirmation bias and anchoring bias most common. Reasoning failures were associated with guideline-discordant and potentially harmful recommendations, particularly in advanced disease management. Automated evaluators using state-of-the-art language models detected error presence but could not reliably classify subtypes. These findings show that large language models may provide fluent but clinically unsafe recommendations when reasoning is flawed. The taxonomy provides a generalizable framework for evaluating and improving reasoning fidelity before clinical deployment.

*Bharadwaj Yadavalli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出动态模板选择(DTS)方法，根据查询复杂度自适应选择响应模板，在保持响应质量的同时显著降低token成本。MLP路由器的准确率达90.5%，比RoBERTa性能更好且参数更少，在三个主流LLM提供商上实现32.6%-33.9%的token减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM部署采用统一的提示策略，对复杂分析任务和简单事实问题都使用冗长的响应模式，导致token效率低下。由于输出token成本比输入token高4-8倍，这种一刀切的方法造成了显著的成本浪费。

Method: 提出了动态模板选择(DTS)方法，比较了两种路由方法：使用预计算嵌入的简单MLP和微调的RoBERTa变换器。在1,000个MMLU问题上进行评估，验证了在三个主要LLM提供商上的泛化能力。

Result: MLP路由器在测试数据上达到90.5%的路由准确率，略高于RoBERTa的89.5%，且参数少1.25亿个。在三个LLM提供商上路由准确率保持90.5%，token减少量在32.6%到33.9%之间。

Conclusion: 该工作贡献了机器学习理论基础的问题形式化、四种算法及其复杂度分析，以及在生产系统上的广泛实证验证。动态模板选择方法能有效降低LLM部署成本，同时保持响应质量。

Abstract: Contemporary large language model deployments typically employ uniform prompting strategies across diverse query types, applying verbose response patterns to both complex analytical tasks and straightforward factual questions. This one-size-fits-all methodology leads to substantial token inefficiency, a concern amplified by the significant cost differential between input and output tokens--the latter commanding 4-8x higher prices across major providers. We present Dynamic Template Selection (DTS), which adaptively matches response templates to query complexity, achieving significant cost reductions without compromising response quality.
  We compared two routing approaches: a simple MLP that uses pre-computed embeddings and a more complex fine-tuned RoBERTa transformer. Through comprehensive evaluation on 1,000 MMLU questions, we find that the MLP router achieves 90.5% routing accuracy on held-out test data, marginally exceeding RoBERTa's performance (89.5%) despite utilizing 125M fewer parameters. Notably, our empirical analysis reveals provider-agnostic behavior in template selection--routing decisions generalize effectively across 3 major LLM providers (OpenAI GPT-4, Google Gemini, and Anthropic Claude), as validated through 9,000 production API calls. While routing accuracy remains consistent at 90.5% across providers, observed token reductions vary from 32.6% to 33.9%, reflecting provider-specific generation characteristics.
  This work contributes several key elements: formal problem formulation with theoretical grounding in machine learning, four algorithms with corresponding complexity analyses, and extensive empirical validation across production systems.

Result: 实验证明多前缀定义能可靠区分记忆与非记忆数据，提供稳健的LLM数据泄露审计方法。

Conclusion: 多前缀记忆框架通过量化记忆稳健性，为评估LLM隐私和版权风险提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Large language models, trained on massive corpora, are prone to verbatim memorization of training data, creating significant privacy and copyright risks. While previous works have proposed various definitions for memorization, many exhibit shortcomings in comprehensively capturing this phenomenon, especially in aligned models. To address this, we introduce a novel framework: multi-prefix memorization. Our core insight is that memorized sequences are deeply encoded and thus retrievable via a significantly larger number of distinct prefixes than non-memorized content. We formalize this by defining a sequence as memorized if an external adversarial search can identify a target count of distinct prefixes that elicit it. This framework shifts the focus from single-path extraction to quantifying the robustness of a memory, measured by the diversity of its retrieval paths. Through experiments on open-source and aligned chat models, we demonstrate that our multi-prefix definition reliably distinguishes memorized from non-memorized data, providing a robust and practical tool for auditing data leakage in LLMs.

Result: 在多种语言模型的SAE特征上实验表明，SAGE产生的解释在生成和预测准确性方面显著优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: SAGE通过将特征解释重构为主动、解释驱动的过程，提供了一种更严谨的方法来理解和解释稀疏自编码器捕获的特征。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque, posing a significant challenge to their safe and reliable deployment. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising tool for decomposing LLM representations into more interpretable features, but explaining the features captured by SAEs remains a challenging task. In this work, we propose SAGE (SAE AGentic Explainer), an agent-based framework that recasts feature interpretation from a passive, single-pass generation task into an active, explanation-driven process. SAGE implements a rigorous methodology by systematically formulating multiple explanations for each feature, designing targeted experiments to test them, and iteratively refining explanations based on empirical activation feedback. Experiments on features from SAEs of diverse language models demonstrate that SAGE produces explanations with significantly higher generative and predictive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art baselines.an agent-based framework that recasts feature interpretation from a passive, single-pass generation task into an active, explanationdriven process.

Motivation: 现有语言模型评估框架（如HELM）使用固定提示，无法准确估计各模型的最大潜力，导致性能评估不具代表性，影响部署决策。

Method: 开发了可复现的DSPy+HELM框架，引入四种结构化提示方法（包括推理链），在七个基准上评估四个前沿语言模型。

Conclusion: 可扩展的性能上限估计方法能提供更有决策价值的基准测试，首次大规模实证研究揭示了不同提示方法对模型行为的影响。

Abstract: As language models (LMs) are increasingly adopted across domains, high-quality benchmarking frameworks that accurately estimate performance are essential for guiding deployment decisions. While frameworks such as Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) enable broad evaluation across tasks, they often rely on fixed prompts that fail to generalize across LMs, yielding unrepresentative performance estimates. Unless we estimate each LM's ceiling (maximum achievable via changes to the prompt), we risk underestimating performance. Declarative prompting frameworks, such as DSPy, offer a scalable alternative to manual prompt engineering by crafting structured prompts that can be optimized per task. However, such frameworks have not been systematically evaluated across established benchmarks. We present a reproducible DSPy+HELM framework that introduces structured prompting methods which elicit reasoning, enabling more accurate LM benchmarking. Using four prompting methods, we evaluate four frontier LMs across seven benchmarks (general/medical domain) against existing HELM baseline scores. We find that without structured prompting: (i) HELM underestimates LM performance (by 4% average), (ii) performance estimates vary more across benchmarks (+2% standard deviation), (iii) performance gaps are misrepresented (leaderboard rankings flip on 3/7 benchmarks), and (iv) introducing reasoning (chain-of-thought) reduces LM sensitivity to prompt design (smaller Δ across prompts). To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale benchmarking study to empirically characterize LM behavior across benchmarks and prompting methods, showing that scalable performance ceiling estimation enables more decision-useful benchmarks. We open-source (i) DSPy+HELM Integration (https://github.com/stanford-crfm/helm/pull/3893) and (ii) Prompt Optimization Pipeline (https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/dspy-helm).

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的Length-MAX分词器，通过最小化平均字符token数来减少训练和推理时的token数量，相比BPE在不同词汇量下减少13-18%的token，显著提升训练效率和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分词方法如BPE主要基于频率优化，但未充分考虑token长度对效率的影响。本文旨在通过优化平均token长度来提高语言模型的训练和推理效率。

Method: 将长度加权目标最大化建模为图划分问题，并开发贪心近似算法来获取词汇表，从而最小化平均字符token数。

Result: 相比BPE减少14-18%的token数量，训练GPT-2模型时减少17-18.5%的训练步数，降低13-14%的推理延迟，提升16%的吞吐量，并在下游任务中提升性能（LAMBADA困惑度降低11.7%，HellaSwag准确率提升4.3%）。

Conclusion: 优化平均token长度而非仅频率，是实现更高效语言建模的有效方法，在不牺牲下游性能的情况下显著提升效率，兼容生产系统并减少18%的内存使用。

Abstract: We introduce a new tokenizer for language models that minimizes the average tokens per character, thereby reducing the number of tokens needed to represent text during training and to generate text during inference. Our method, which we refer to as the Length-MAX tokenizer, obtains its vocabulary by casting a length-weighted objective maximization as a graph partitioning problem and developing a greedy approximation algorithm. On FineWeb and diverse domains, it yields 14--18\% fewer tokens than Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) across vocabulary sizes from 10K to 50K, and the reduction is 13.0\% when the size is 64K. Training GPT-2 models at 124M, 355M, and 1.3B parameters from scratch with five runs each shows 18.5\%, 17.2\%, and 18.5\% fewer steps, respectively, to reach a fixed validation loss, and 13.7\%, 12.7\%, and 13.7\% lower inference latency, together with a 16\% throughput gain at 124M, while consistently improving on downstream tasks including reducing LAMBADA perplexity by 11.7\% and enhancing HellaSwag accuracy by 4.3\%. Moreover, the Length-MAX tokenizer achieves 99.62\% vocabulary coverage and the out-of-vocabulary rate remains low at 0.12\% on test sets. These results demonstrate that optimizing for average token length, rather than frequency alone, offers an effective approach to more efficient language modeling without sacrificing -- and often improving -- downstream performance. The tokenizer is compatible with production systems and reduces embedding and KV-cache memory by 18\% at inference.

Abstract: Statefulness is essential for large language model (LLM) agents to perform long-term planning and problem-solving. This makes memory a critical component, yet its management and evolution remain largely underexplored. Existing evaluations mostly focus on static conversational settings, where memory is passively retrieved from dialogue to answer queries, overlooking the dynamic ability to accumulate and reuse experience across evolving task streams. In real-world environments such as interactive problem assistants or embodied agents, LLMs are required to handle continuous task streams, yet often fail to learn from accumulated interactions, losing valuable contextual insights, a limitation that calls for test-time evolution, where LLMs retrieve, integrate, and update memory continuously during deployment. To bridge this gap, we introduce Evo-Memory, a comprehensive streaming benchmark and framework for evaluating self-evolving memory in LLM agents. Evo-Memory structures datasets into sequential task streams, requiring LLMs to search, adapt, and evolve memory after each interaction. We unify and implement over ten representative memory modules and evaluate them across 10 diverse multi-turn goal-oriented and single-turn reasoning and QA datasets. To better benchmark experience reuse, we provide a baseline method, ExpRAG, for retrieving and utilizing prior experience, and further propose ReMem, an action-think-memory refine pipeline that tightly integrates reasoning, task actions, and memory updates to achieve continual improvement.

Abstract: Argument mining is a subfield of natural language processing to identify and extract the argument components, like premises and conclusions, within a text and to recognize the relations between them. It reveals the logical structure of texts to be used in tasks like knowledge extraction. This paper aims at utilizing a cross-lingual approach to argument mining for low-resource languages, by constructing three training scenarios. We examine the models on English, as a high-resource language, and Persian, as a low-resource language. To this end, we evaluate the models based on the English Microtext corpus \citep{PeldszusStede2015}, and its parallel Persian translation. The learning scenarios are as follow: (i) zero-shot transfer, where the model is trained solely with the English data, (ii) English-only training enhanced by synthetic examples generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), and (iii) a cross-lingual model that combines the original English data with manually translated Persian sentences. The zero-shot transfer model attains F1 scores of 50.2\% on the English test set and 50.7\% on the Persian test set. LLM-based augmentation model improves the performance up to 59.2\% on English and 69.3\% on Persian. The cross-lingual model, trained on both languages but evaluated solely on the Persian test set, surpasses the LLM-based variant, by achieving a F1 of 74.8\%. Results indicate that a lightweight cross-lingual blend can outperform considerably the more resource-intensive augmentation pipelines, and it offers a practical pathway for the argument mining task to overcome data resource shortage on low-resource languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合角色交叉最小对、时间涌现分析和跨模型比较的方法，研究LLMs如何实现语义角色，发现LLMs形成紧凑、因果隔离的抽象语义结构机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型显示出语义能力，但其实现抽象语义结构的内在机制仍不够清晰，需要更深入的表征研究。

Method: 整合角色交叉最小对、时间涌现分析和跨模型比较的方法来研究LLMs实现语义角色的机制。

Result: 发现：(i)高度集中的电路(89-94%归因在28个节点内)；(ii)渐进结构优化而非相变，大模型有时绕过局部电路；(iii)中等跨尺度守恒(24-59%组件重叠)和高光谱相似性。

Conclusion: LLMs形成紧凑、因果隔离的抽象语义结构机制，这些机制在跨尺度和架构时表现出部分传递性。

Abstract: Despite displaying semantic competence, large language models' internal mechanisms that ground abstract semantic structure remain insufficiently characterised. We propose a method integrating role-cross minimal pairs, temporal emergence analysis, and cross-model comparison to study how LLMs implement semantic roles. Our analysis uncovers: (i) highly concentrated circuits (89-94% attribution within 28 nodes); (ii) gradual structural refinement rather than phase transitions, with larger models sometimes bypassing localised circuits; and (iii) moderate cross-scale conservation (24-59% component overlap) alongside high spectral similarity. These findings suggest that LLMs form compact, causally isolated mechanisms for abstract semantic structure, and these mechanisms exhibit partial transfer across scales and architectures.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chatty-KG是一个用于知识图谱对话问答的多智能体系统，结合了检索增强生成和结构化查询执行，在单轮和多轮对话中都显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在知识图谱对话问答中的局限性：LLM无法直接访问私有动态知识图谱，RAG系统序列化结构且难以处理多轮上下文，传统KGQA系统仅支持单轮问答且延迟高。

Method: 采用模块化多智能体架构，通过任务专用LLM智能体协作实现上下文解释、对话跟踪、实体关系链接和高效查询规划，生成可执行的SPARQL查询。

Result: 在多样化的知识图谱上实验表明，Chatty-KG在单轮和多轮设置中显著优于最先进基线，获得更高的F1和P@1分数，且与商业和开源LLM兼容。

Conclusion: Chatty-KG统一了对话灵活性和结构化知识图谱基础，为可靠的多轮KGQA提供了可扩展和可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Conversational Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs (KGs) combines the factual grounding of KG-based QA with the interactive nature of dialogue systems. KGs are widely used in enterprise and domain applications to provide structured, evolving, and reliable knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) enable natural and context-aware conversations, but lack direct access to private and dynamic KGs. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems can retrieve graph content but often serialize structure, struggle with multi-turn context, and require heavy indexing. Traditional KGQA systems preserve structure but typically support only single-turn QA, incur high latency, and struggle with coreference and context tracking. To address these limitations, we propose Chatty-KG, a modular multi-agent system for conversational QA over KGs. Chatty-KG combines RAG-style retrieval with structured execution by generating SPARQL queries through task-specialized LLM agents. These agents collaborate for contextual interpretation, dialogue tracking, entity and relation linking, and efficient query planning, enabling accurate and low-latency translation of natural questions into executable queries. Experiments on large and diverse KGs show that Chatty-KG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both single-turn and multi-turn settings, achieving higher F1 and P@1 scores. Its modular design preserves dialogue coherence and supports evolving KGs without fine-tuning or pre-processing. Evaluations with commercial (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0) and open-weight (e.g., Phi-4, Gemma 3) LLMs confirm broad compatibility and stable performance. Overall, Chatty-KG unifies conversational flexibility with structured KG grounding, offering a scalable and extensible approach for reliable multi-turn KGQA.

TL;DR: LLMs在定义类问题上表现最佳，但在举例说明类问题上表现最差，且对高频知识更容易进行释义，对低频技术知识释义较少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在除定义类查询外的其他类型问题（如举例、释义等）上的性能下降，研究预训练数据对LLMs回答多样化语言查询的影响。

Method: 使用TrackList细粒度语言和统计分析流程，引入RefoMed-EN数据集（6170个人工标注的医学术语及其定义、命名、举例、解释或释义），通过句法和语义相似性指标、统计相关性和嵌入来评估LLM输出质量。

Result: LLMs在定义类问题上的任务性能最高，在举例说明类问题上最低；对于定义类问题，LLMs倾向于对流行和频繁知识进行更多释义，而对尾部和技术知识（特别是在专业文本中）释义较少。

Conclusion: LLMs在处理多样化语言查询时存在性能差异，定义类问题表现最佳，举例类问题表现最差，且对知识的频率敏感，高频知识更容易被释义。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven efficient in giving definition-type answers to user input queries. While for humans giving various types of answers, such as examples and paraphrases, is an easy task, LLMs struggle to provide correct answers for other than definition-type queries. In this study, we evaluated this drop in performance using TrackList, a fine-grained linguistic and statistical analysis pipeline to investigate the impact of the pre-training data on LLMs answers to diverse linguistic queries. We also introduce RefoMed-EN, an English dataset consisting of 6170 human-annotated medical terms alongside their corresponding definitions, denominations, exemplifications, explanations, or paraphrases. We studied whether the high frequency of a concept (head) or low frequency (tail) impacts the language model's performance. We evaluated the quality of the LLM's output using syntactic and semantic similarity metrics, statistical correlations and embeddings. Results showed that the LLM's task performance for definition type questions is the highest, while for the exemplification type it is the lowest. Additionally, we showed that for definition-type questions, large language models are prone to paraphrase more on popular and frequent knowledge and less on tail and technical knowledge, especially in the expert texts.

*Anantha Padmanaban Krishna Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现上下文学习(ICL)无法覆盖预训练的标签语义，而是主要调整输入如何映射到预训练期间学习的稳定语义方向，揭示了少样本提示的基本限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究上下文学习是否能覆盖预训练的标签语义，还是仅仅细化现有的语义主干。

Method: 将LLMs视为提示诱导的分类器，对比其在自然演示(正确标签)和反转演示(系统翻转标签含义)下的行为，分解ICL行为为三个对齐指标(真实性、先验性和提示对齐)，并引入语义覆盖率。

Result: 在8个分类任务和8个开源LLM(1-12B参数)上，发现ICL在自然演示下提高准确性但保持强先验对齐；在反转演示下模型无法学习连贯的反语义分类器，语义覆盖率在少样本设置中保持为零。

Conclusion: ICL不能灵活地重新映射标签含义，而是主要调整输入如何投影到预训练期间学习的稳定语义方向上，表明在这些规模上覆盖标签语义需要超越ICL的干预措施。

Abstract: Can in-context learning (ICL) override pre-trained label semantics, or does it merely refine an existing semantic backbone? We address this question by treating LLMs as prompt-induced classifiers and contrasting their behavior under \emph{natural} demonstrations (with correct labels) and \emph{inverted} demonstrations (systematically flipping label meanings). We decompose ICL behavior into three alignment metrics (truth, prior, and prompt alignment) and introduce a semantic override rate, defined as correctness under flipped semantics. Across eight classification tasks and eight open-source LLMs (1--12B parameters), we find consistent evidence for a semantic anchor view. With natural demonstrations, ICL improves accuracy while maintaining strong prior alignment; most correct predictions coincide with zero-shot behavior, even when the prior is weak. With inverted demonstrations, models cannot learn coherent anti-semantic classifiers: prompt alignment increases only by sacrificing accuracy, and semantic override rates remain exactly zero in our few-shot 1--12B setting. Rather than flexibly remapping label meanings, ICL primarily adjusts how inputs project onto stable semantic directions learned during pre-training, clarifying fundamental limits of few-shot prompting and suggesting that overriding label semantics at these scales requires interventions beyond ICL.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合检索上下文信息的讽刺检测方法，通过外部知识检索和内部知识提取来增强大语言模型在讽刺检测中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 讽刺检测在自然语言处理中仍然具有挑战性，现有预训练语言模型和大语言模型在处理复杂讽刺文本时表现不佳，特别是在涉及文化差异和特定俚语时。

Method: 在Pragmatic Metacognitive Prompting方法基础上，引入检索感知方法：1) 当模型缺乏背景知识时使用基于网络的外部知识检索；2) 激发模型内部知识的自我认知策略。

Result: 在三个数据集上评估：Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic数据集上外部知识检索使macro-F1提升9.87%；Semeval和MUStARD数据集上内部知识提取分别提升3.29%和4.08%。

Conclusion: 上下文信息对提升大语言模型在讽刺检测任务中的性能至关重要，特别是涉及文化特定俚语、引用或未知术语时。未来工作将优化相关上下文信息的检索质量。

Abstract: Detecting sarcasm remains a challenging task in the areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP) despite recent advances in neural network approaches. Currently, Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are the preferred approach for sarcasm detection. However, the complexity of sarcastic text, combined with linguistic diversity and cultural variation across communities, has made the task more difficult even for PLMs and LLMs. Beyond that, those models also exhibit unreliable detection of words or tokens that require extra grounding for analysis. Building on a state-of-the-art prompting method in LLMs for sarcasm detection called Pragmatic Metacognitive Prompting (PMP), we introduce a retrieval-aware approach that incorporates retrieved contextual information for each target text. Our pipeline explores two complementary ways to provide context: adding non-parametric knowledge using web-based retrieval when the model lacks necessary background, and eliciting the model's own internal knowledge for a self-knowledge awareness strategy. We evaluated our approach with three datasets, such as Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic, SemEval-2018 Task 3, and MUStARD. Non-parametric retrieval resulted in a significant 9.87% macro-F1 improvement on Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic compared to the original PMP method. Self-knowledge retrieval improves macro-F1 by 3.29% on Semeval and by 4.08% on MUStARD. These findings highlight the importance of context in enhancing LLMs performance in sarcasm detection task, particularly the involvement of culturally specific slang, references, or unknown terms to the LLMs. Future work will focus on optimizing the retrieval of relevant contextual information and examining how retrieval quality affects performance.

*Thura Aung,Eaint Kay Khaing Kyaw,Ye Kyaw Thu,Thazin Myint Oo,Thepchai Supnithi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 在缅甸语等低资源语言分类任务中，Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)作为分类头替代MLPs，在多种嵌入表示上表现优异，其中EfficientKAN在fastText上获得最高F1分数0.928，FasterKAN在速度和精度间达到最佳平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言如缅甸语的分类任务通常只微调最终分类层，保持预训练编码器权重冻结。传统MLPs的固定非线性限制了表达能力并增加了计算成本，需要寻找更优的替代方案。

Method: 探索三种KAN变体作为分类头：基于傅里叶的FourierKAN、基于样条的EfficientKAN和基于网格的FasterKAN，在TF-IDF、fastText和多语言变换器（mBERT、Distil-mBERT）等多种嵌入表示上进行评估。

Result: 实验结果显示KAN基分类头与MLPs相当或更优。EfficientKAN在fastText上获得最高F1分数0.928，FasterKAN在速度和精度间达到最佳平衡。在变换器嵌入上，EfficientKAN与mBERT配合时匹配或略优于MLPs（F1分数0.917）。

Conclusion: KANs是低资源语言分类任务中MLPs的表达力强、效率高的替代方案。

Abstract: In low-resource languages like Burmese, classification tasks often fine-tune only the final classification layer, keeping pre-trained encoder weights frozen. While Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are commonly used, their fixed non-linearity can limit expressiveness and increase computational cost. This work explores Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as alternative classification heads, evaluating Fourier-based FourierKAN, Spline-based EfficientKAN, and Grid-based FasterKAN-across diverse embeddings including TF-IDF, fastText, and multilingual transformers (mBERT, Distil-mBERT). Experimental results show that KAN-based heads are competitive with or superior to MLPs. EfficientKAN with fastText achieved the highest F1-score (0.928), while FasterKAN offered the best trade-off between speed and accuracy. On transformer embeddings, EfficientKAN matched or slightly outperformed MLPs with mBERT (0.917 F1). These findings highlight KANs as expressive, efficient alternatives to MLPs for low-resource language classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估不同架构大语言模型在满足硬性拼写约束方面的能力，填补跨架构系统评估的空白。

Method: 使用三个模型家族（Qwen3、Claude Haiku-4.5、GPT-5-mini）的28个配置，在58个需要字符级约束满足的单词谜题上进行测试，并结合10,000名人类解谜者的难度评级。

Result: 架构差异产生2.0-2.2倍的性能差距，而参数缩放仅带来83%增益；模型在拼写异常的常见词汇（如"data"、"poop"、"loll"）上存在86-95%的人类成功率对比89-96%的模型失败率。

Conclusion: 约束满足可能需要专门的架构特征或训练目标，而不仅仅是参数或计算预算的缩放，模型过度依赖分布合理性而惩罚拼写异常但约束有效的模式。

Abstract: Large language models must satisfy hard orthographic constraints during controlled text generation, yet systematic cross-architecture evaluation remains limited. We evaluate 28 configurations spanning three model families (Qwen3, Claude Haiku-4.5, GPT-5-mini) on 58 word puzzles requiring character-level constraint satisfaction. Architectural differences produce substantially larger performance gaps (2.0-2.2x, F1=0.761 vs. 0.343) than parameter scaling within families (83% gain from eightfold scaling), suggesting that constraint satisfaction may require specialized architectural features or training objectives beyond standard language model scaling. Thinking budget sensitivity proves heterogeneous: high-capacity models show strong returns (+0.102 to +0.136 F1), while mid-sized variants saturate or degrade. These patterns are inconsistent with uniform compute benefits. Using difficulty ratings from 10,000 human solvers per puzzle, we establish modest but consistent calibration (r=0.24-0.38) across all families, yet identify systematic failures on common words with unusual orthography ("data", "poop", "loll": 86-95% human success, 89-96% model miss rate). These failures reveal over-reliance on distributional plausibility that penalizes orthographically atypical but constraint-valid patterns, suggesting architectural innovations may be required beyond simply scaling parameters or computational budgets.

Motivation: 缅甸语作为低资源语言，其ASR系统存在较高错误率，目前缺乏针对性的错误校正研究，需要开发有效的特征集成方法来提升ASR输出质量。

Method: 使用序列到序列Transformer模型，集成IPA（国际音标）和语音对齐特征，在五个不同的ASR骨干网络上进行错误校正。

Result: 提出的AEC模型将平均WER从51.56降至39.82（增强前），chrF++得分从0.5864提升至0.627，在所有ASR骨干网络上均实现了稳定改进。

Conclusion: AEC方法在低资源环境下具有鲁棒性，特征设计对于提升ASR输出质量至关重要，特别是在资源受限的语言中。

Abstract: This paper investigates sequence-to-sequence Transformer models for automatic speech recognition (ASR) error correction in low-resource Burmese, focusing on different feature integration strategies including IPA and alignment information. To our knowledge, this is the first study addressing ASR error correction specifically for Burmese. We evaluate five ASR backbones and show that our ASR Error Correction (AEC) approaches consistently improve word- and character-level accuracy over baseline outputs. The proposed AEC model, combining IPA and alignment features, reduced the average WER of ASR models from 51.56 to 39.82 before augmentation (and 51.56 to 43.59 after augmentation) and improving chrF++ scores from 0.5864 to 0.627, demonstrating consistent gains over the baseline ASR outputs without AEC. Our results highlight the robustness of AEC and the importance of feature design for improving ASR outputs in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: 双专家架构结合指令残差技术有效解决了专业领域大语言模型的知识增强与指令跟随能力平衡问题，在抵押贷款金融领域取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities across general domains, yet their application to specialized sectors such as mortgage finance requires domain-specific knowledge augmentation while preserving instruction-following fidelity. We present MortgageLLM, a novel domain-specific large language model that addresses this dual challenge. It is developed using a dual-track specialization framework from a single base model (LLaMA-3.1-8B). We opted for this dual-expert approach as a single multi-task model suffers from performance trade-offs, where optimizing for structured tasks (via SFT) degrades conversational fidelity (via DPO). Our dual-track method solves this by creating two specialists, allowing each to be optimally trained for its distinct capability. Our approach applies the instruction residual technique to restore instruction-following capabilities post-domain adaptation without supervised fine-tuning. We contribute: (1) application of this residual technique to the highly specialized mortgage finance domain; (2) a dual-expert architecture combining a conversational Q&A model and a structured task model for classification and summarization; and (3) an intelligent task routing mechanism using few-shot classification performed by one of the expert models itself. We validate our approach on domain-specific benchmarks, where our final model (MLM v2) significantly outperforms the base LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct, achieving an LLM-as-a-Judge summarization score of 4.58 (vs. 3.99), a Q&A score of 4.09 (vs. 4.0), and a classification score of 2.6 (vs. 1.2). On semantic similarity, our model achieved a BERTScore of 0.77 for summarization (vs. 0.74), 0.68 for Q&A (vs. 0.58), and 0.75 for classification (vs. 0.73), substantially outperforming baseline approaches.

Motivation: 推理模型在复杂推理任务中表现出色，但面对对抗性越狱提示时安全性不足，需要自适应安全对齐方法来增强防御能力。

Method: SGASA包含两个阶段：数据预合成（生成安全指南和增强提示）和对齐微调（使用SFT和DPO将指南嵌入模型）。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，SGASA显著提高了模型安全性。

Conclusion: SGASA框架验证了其自适应和可扩展的有效性，能够增强模型对抗有害对抗提示的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, ensuring their safety against adversarial jailbreak prompts remains a critical challenge. Due to the covert and deceptive nature of such prompts, they can often evade built-in safety mechanisms and lead to the generation of harmful content. This underscores the need for an adaptive safety alignment approach that enables models to autonomously reinforce their defenses in response to adversarial inputs. This paper introduces the Synthesized Guideline-based Adaptive Safety Alignment (SGASA) framework, which internalizes model-generated safety guidelines to strengthen models' ability to enhance robustness against harmful adversarial prompts while minimizing unnecessary refusals of benign requests. SGASA consists of two key stages: Data Pre-synthesis, which generates safety guidelines and augmented prompts; and Alignment Fine-tuning, which leverages Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to embed these guidelines into the model. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that SGASA significantly improves model safety, validating its adaptive and scalable effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，在少量人类调查数据上微调LLM可以改善模拟结果的异质性和对齐性，但即使最佳微调模型也无法复现原始研究的回归系数，因此LLM生成的数据仍不适合替代人类参与者进行正式推断分析。

Motivation: 探讨在少量人类调查数据上微调LLM是否能缓解LLM与真实人类行为之间的差异问题，包括多样性不足、少数群体系统性错位、组内方差不足以及信念与行动不一致等问题。

Method: 使用信息披露行为实验，比较人类和LLM生成的反应，评估分布差异、子群体对齐、信念-行动一致性以及回归系数恢复等多个维度。

Result: 在少量人类样本上微调显著改善了异质性、对齐性和信念-行动一致性，但即使最佳微调模型也无法恢复原始研究的回归系数。

Conclusion: LLM生成的数据仍不适合替代人类参与者进行正式推断分析，尽管微调能在某些方面改善模拟结果。

Abstract: There is ongoing debate about whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as substitutes for human participants in survey and experimental research. While recent work in fields such as marketing and psychology has explored the potential of LLM-based simulation, a growing body of evidence cautions against this practice: LLMs often fail to align with real human behavior, exhibiting limited diversity, systematic misalignment for minority subgroups, insufficient within-group variance, and discrepancies between stated beliefs and actions. This study examines an important and distinct question in this domain: whether fine-tuning on a small subset of human survey data, such as that obtainable from a pilot study, can mitigate these issues and yield realistic simulated outcomes. Using a behavioral experiment on information disclosure, we compare human and LLM-generated responses across multiple dimensions, including distributional divergence, subgroup alignment, belief-action coherence, and the recovery of regression coefficients. We find that fine-tuning on small human samples substantially improves heterogeneity, alignment, and belief-action coherence relative to the base model. However, even the best-performing fine-tuned models fail to reproduce the regression coefficients of the original study, suggesting that LLM-generated data remain unsuitable for replacing human participants in formal inferential analyses.

Motivation: 现有语音语料库主要基于朗读或脚本语音，缺乏自然对话数据。伊桑语缺乏标准化正字法，书写实践差异大，这给转录工作带来挑战。

Method: 建立实用的转录协议，在表征准确性和计算处理需求之间取得平衡，处理伊桑语与泰语之间的词汇声调差异。

Conclusion: 通过发布这一开放资源，旨在促进包容性AI发展，支持对代表性不足语言的研究，并为建模对话语音的语言和技术挑战提供基础。

Abstract: This paper introduces the development of the first open conversational speech dataset for the Isan language, the most widely spoken regional dialect in Thailand. Unlike existing speech corpora that are primarily based on read or scripted speech, this dataset consists of natural speech, thereby capturing authentic linguistic phenomena such as colloquials, spontaneous prosody, disfluencies, and frequent code-switching with central Thai. A key challenge in building this resource lies in the lack of a standardized orthography for Isan. Current writing practices vary considerably, due to the different lexical tones between Thai and Isan. This variability complicates the design of transcription guidelines and poses questions regarding consistency, usability, and linguistic authenticity. To address these issues, we establish practical transcription protocols that balance the need for representational accuracy with the requirements of computational processing. By releasing this dataset as an open resource, we aim to contribute to inclusive AI development, support research on underrepresented languages, and provide a basis for addressing the linguistic and technical challenges inherent in modeling conversational speech.

Conclusion: PEFT-Bench填补了当前PEFT方法评估的空白，提供了一个可复现且全面的基准测试平台，有助于推动参数高效微调技术的发展和应用。

Abstract: Despite the state-of-the-art performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) achieved on many tasks, their massive scale often leads to high computational and environmental costs, limiting their accessibility. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods address this challenge by reducing the number of trainable parameters while maintaining strong downstream performance. Despite the increased development in PEFT methods, current evaluations remain limited (in terms of evaluated models and datasets) and difficult to reproduce. To bridge this gap, we introduce PEFT-Bench, a unified end-to-end benchmark for evaluating diverse PEFT methods on autoregressive LLMs. We demonstrate its usage across 27 NLP datasets and 6 PEFT methods. To account for different PEFT training and inference factors, we also introduce the PEFT Soft Score Penalties (PSCP) metric, which takes trainable parameters, inference speed, and training memory usage into account.

### [148] [Emergent Lexical Semantics in Neural Language Models: Testing Martin's Law on LLM-Generated Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21334)
*Kai Kugler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现语言模型训练过程中Martin's Law（词频与多义性关系）呈现非单调发展轨迹，在特定检查点达到峰值后下降，不同规模模型表现出不同退化模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统研究神经网络语言模型在训练过程中生成的文本是否遵循Martin's Law这一语言学规律，探索语言结构在模型中的涌现过程。

Method: 使用DBSCAN聚类上下文嵌入来操作化词义，分析四个Pythia模型（70M-1B参数）在30个训练检查点上的表现。

Result: Martin's Law在检查点100左右出现，在104达到峰值相关性（r>0.6），在105下降；小模型出现灾难性语义崩溃，大模型呈现优雅退化；频率-特异性权衡保持稳定。

Conclusion: 语言模型对语言学规律的遵循不是单调递增的，而是遵循具有最优语义窗口的平衡轨迹，为评估神经网络语言模型中涌现的语言结构建立了新方法。

Abstract: We present the first systematic investigation of Martin's Law - the empirical relationship between word frequency and polysemy - in text generated by neural language models during training. Using DBSCAN clustering of contextualized embeddings as an operationalization of word senses, we analyze four Pythia models (70M-1B parameters) across 30 training checkpoints. Our results reveal a non-monotonic developmental trajectory: Martin's Law emerges around checkpoint 100, reaches peak correlation (r > 0.6) at checkpoint 104, then degrades by checkpoint 105. Smaller models (70M, 160M) experience catastrophic semantic collapse at late checkpoints, while larger models (410M, 1B) show graceful degradation. The frequency-specificity trade-off remains stable (r $\approx$ -0.3) across all models. These findings suggest that compliance with linguistic regularities in LLM-generated text is not monotonically increasing with training, but instead follows a balanced trajectory with an optimal semantic window. This work establishes a novel methodology for evaluating emergent linguistic structure in neural language models.

*Joshua Fonseca Rivera*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过微调训练，使7B参数模型能够可靠检测单令牌注入的"思想"，准确率从0.4%提升至85%，满足准确性、基础性和内部性标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Lindsey研究中提出的开放性问题：训练内省能力是否能消除跨模型差异，探索AI透明度的构建路径。

Method: 通过对瞬时单令牌注入进行微调训练，使模型学习检测和识别注入的激活模式。

Result: 模型从近乎完全失败（0.4%准确率）转变为可靠检测（85%准确率，0%误报），能够检测单令牌位置的瞬时"思想"并保留信息。

Conclusion: 至少一种内省行为成分可以直接通过训练诱导，为构建内置AI透明度提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Lindsey (2025) investigates introspective awareness in language models through four experiments, finding that models can sometimes detect and identify injected activation patterns -- but unreliably (~20% success in the best model). We focus on the first of these experiments -- self-report of injected "thoughts" -- and ask whether this capability can be directly trained rather than waiting for emergence. Through fine-tuning on transient single-token injections, we transform a 7B parameter model from near-complete failure (0.4% accuracy, 6.7% false positive rate) to reliable detection (85% accuracy on held-out concepts at α=40, 0% false positives). Our model detects fleeting "thoughts" injected at a single token position, retains that information, and reports the semantic content across subsequent generation steps. On this task, our trained model satisfies three of Lindsey's criteria: accuracy (correct identification), grounding (0/60 false positives), and internality (detection precedes verbalization). Generalization to unseen concept vectors (7.5pp gap) demonstrates the model learns a transferable skill rather than memorizing specific vectors, though this does not establish metacognitive representation in Lindsey's sense. These results address an open question raised by Lindsey: whether "training for introspection would help eliminate cross-model differences." We show that at least one component of introspective behavior can be directly induced, offering a pathway to built-in AI transparency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文创建了捷克语和斯洛伐克语细粒度证据提取数据集，评估了多种大语言模型在证据提取任务上的表现，发现模型大小与性能并非正相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线新闻评论中经常传播错误信息，需要有效方法来检测事实错误信息，这需要从相关文档中精确定位支持或反驳主张的文本证据。

Method: 创建了由付费标注人员标注的细粒度证据数据集，评估了多种大语言模型（LLMs）在该数据集上的表现，分析其与人工标注的一致性。

Result: LLMs经常无法从源文本逐字复制证据，导致无效输出。llama3.1:8b模型虽然规模较小但正确率较高，而gpt-oss-120b模型参数更多但表现较差。qwen3:14b、deepseek-r1:32b和gpt-oss:20b在模型大小与人工标注一致性之间达到了有效平衡。

Conclusion: 模型大小与证据提取性能并非简单正相关，中等规模的模型在细粒度证据提取任务上可能达到最佳平衡。

Abstract: Misinformation frequently spreads in user comments under online news articles, highlighting the need for effective methods to detect factually incorrect information. To strongly support or refute claims extracted from such comments, it is necessary to identify relevant documents and pinpoint the exact text spans that justify or contradict each claim. This paper focuses on the latter task -- fine-grained evidence extraction for Czech and Slovak claims. We create new dataset, containing two-way annotated fine-grained evidence created by paid annotators. We evaluate large language models (LLMs) on this dataset to assess their alignment with human annotations. The results reveal that LLMs often fail to copy evidence verbatim from the source text, leading to invalid outputs. Error-rate analysis shows that the {llama3.1:8b model achieves a high proportion of correct outputs despite its relatively small size, while the gpt-oss-120b model underperforms despite having many more parameters. Furthermore, the models qwen3:14b, deepseek-r1:32b, and gpt-oss:20b demonstrate an effective balance between model size and alignment with human annotations.

*Zhifeng Hao,Qibin Song,Ruichu Cai,Boyan Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DSR-SQL是一个双状态推理框架，通过上下文状态和生成状态的交互来解决复杂企业数据库的Text-to-SQL问题，无需后训练或上下文示例就能达到竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分治推理方法在复杂企业数据库上存在上下文容量有限、模式链接不可靠和数据库语义基础薄弱的问题，导致推理不连贯。

Method: DSR-SQL将Text-to-SQL建模为自适应上下文状态和渐进生成状态的交互：前者通过精炼大型模式并选择相关结构来构建紧凑的语义忠实环境；后者将SQL合成形式化为反馈引导的状态转换，使模型能够自我纠正并与用户意图对齐。

Result: 在Spider 2.0-Snow上达到35.28%的执行准确率，在BIRD开发集上达到68.32%的执行准确率。

Conclusion: DSR-SQL通过双状态推理框架有效解决了复杂企业数据库Text-to-SQL中的挑战，实现了竞争性性能，且无需额外训练或示例。

Abstract: Recent divide-and-conquer reasoning approaches, particularly those based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT), have substantially improved the Text-to-SQL capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, when applied to complex enterprise databases, such methods struggle to maintain coherent reasoning due to limited context capacity, unreliable schema linking, and weak grounding in database semantics. To overcome these issues, we introduce DSR-SQL, a \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{S}tate \textbf{R}easoning framework that models Text-to-SQL as an interaction between an adaptive context state and a progressive generation state. The first constructs a compact, semantically faithful environment by refining large schemas and selecting relevant structures, while the second formalizes SQL synthesis as feedback-guided state transitions, enabling the model to self-correct and align with user intent. Without any post-training or in-context examples, DSR-SQL achieves competitive performance, reaching 35.28\% execution accuracy on Spider 2.0-Snow and 68.32\% on BIRD development set. Our implementation will be open-sourced at: https://github.com/DMIRLAB-Group/DSR-SQL.

TL;DR: Odin是一个新的架构，通过定向双模块机制在特定Transformer层注入图结构，避免了传统GNN的过平滑问题和Transformer忽视图拓扑的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖GNN但受限于过平滑和跳数依赖扩散，要么使用Transformer但忽视图拓扑并将节点视为孤立序列。需要有效结合文本理解和结构推理。

Method: 提出Odin架构，在特定Transformer层通过定向双模块机制注入图结构，不依赖多跳扩散，而是在不同层次进行结构抽象。还提出轻量版Light Odin用于大规模或低资源场景。

Result: 在多个文本丰富的图基准测试中，Odin达到最先进精度，Light Odin以显著降低的计算成本提供竞争性性能。

Conclusion: Odin和Light Odin形成了一个统一的、无跳数的结构-文本集成框架，其表达能力严格包含纯Transformer和GNN。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs require models to effectively combine strong textual understanding with structurally informed reasoning. Existing approaches either rely on GNNs--limited by over-smoothing and hop-dependent diffusion--or employ Transformers that overlook graph topology and treat nodes as isolated sequences. We propose Odin (Oriented Dual-module INtegration), a new architecture that injects graph structure into Transformers at selected depths through an oriented dual-module mechanism.Unlike message-passing GNNs, Odin does not rely on multi-hop diffusion; instead, multi-hop structures are integrated at specific Transformer layers, yielding low-, mid-, and high-level structural abstraction aligned with the model's semantic hierarchy. Because aggregation operates on the global [CLS] representation, Odin fundamentally avoids over-smoothing and decouples structural abstraction from neighborhood size or graph topology. We further establish that Odin's expressive power strictly contains that of both pure Transformers and GNNs.To make the design efficient in large-scale or low-resource settings, we introduce Light Odin, a lightweight variant that preserves the same layer-aligned structural abstraction for faster training and inference. Experiments on multiple text-rich graph benchmarks show that Odin achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, while Light Odin delivers competitive performance with significantly reduced computational cost. Together, Odin and Light Odin form a unified, hop-free framework for principled structure-text integration. The source code of this model has been released at https://github.com/hongkaifeng/Odin.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 对六种最先进的模型合并方法在大型语言模型上进行大规模系统评估，发现最简单的方法Task Arithmetic是唯一能可靠提升性能的方法，其他方法通常导致性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型合并是一种无需额外训练就能复用模型并高效提升性能的方法，但尚不清楚在小模型和分类器上报告的优势是否能推广到LLMs。

Method: 对四种开源权重LLMs、每个基础模型十二个微调检查点和十六个标准LLM基准进行六种最先进合并方法的大规模系统评估。

Result: 最古老和最简单的方法Task Arithmetic是唯一能可靠在LLMs上产生性能增益的方法，其他干扰感知和子空间合并方法通常导致显著性能下降。

Conclusion: 当前的合并技术不能直接迁移到现代LLMs，这促使需要设计LLM特定的合并算法和合并感知的微调方法。

Abstract: Model merging combines multiple fine-tuned checkpoints into a single model without additional training, offering an attractive approach to reusing models and efficiently improving performance. However, it remains unclear whether the advantages reported for smaller models and classifiers generalize to LLMs. We present a large-scale, systematic evaluation of six state-of-the-art merging methods, including recent subspace methods, across four open-weight LLMs, twelve fine-tuned checkpoints per base model, and sixteen standard LLM benchmarks. Evaluating through standardized benchmarks, we measure both the probability that a merged model outperforms the base model and relative gains over the best individual checkpoint. Our results show that the oldest and simplest method, Task Arithmetic, is the only approach that reliably yields performance gains on LLMs. Other interference-aware and subspace merging methods typically result in significant performance drops. Our findings indicate that current merging techniques do not directly transfer to modern LLMs. This motivates the design of LLM-specific merging algorithms and merging-aware fine-tuning methods. Code will be released upon acceptance of this paper.

Result: 在中文和英文数据集上的实验结果表明，该模型取得了有竞争力的性能，优于其他基线模型。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效解决文本长度和可读性标签序数关系的问题，在可读性评估任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Readability assessment aims to evaluate the reading difficulty of a text. In recent years, while deep learning technology has been gradually applied to readability assessment, most approaches fail to consider either the length of the text or the ordinal relationship of readability labels. This paper proposes a bidirectional readability assessment mechanism that captures contextual information to identify regions with rich semantic information in the text, thereby predicting the readability level of individual sentences. These sentence-level labels are then used to assist in predicting the overall readability level of the document. Additionally, a pairwise sorting algorithm is introduced to model the ordinal relationship between readability levels through label subtraction. Experimental results on Chinese and English datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance and outperforms other baseline models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究揭示了语音翻译模型在性别分配决策中的机制，发现模型不简单复制训练数据中的性别关联，而是学习更广泛的男性主导模式，并能基于声学输入覆盖内部语言模型的男性偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音翻译中，当从概念性别语言翻译到语法性别语言时，说话者的声音特征可能影响性别分配，存在误判性别的风险。但目前对语音翻译模型如何做出这些决策的理解不足。

Method: 研究三个语言对（英-西/法/意），通过对比特征归因分析声谱图，考察训练数据模式、内部语言模型偏见和声学信息的相互作用。

Result: 发现准确率更高的模型使用第一人称代词将性别化术语链接回说话者，访问分布在频率谱而非集中在音高的性别信息。

Conclusion: 语音翻译模型通过一种先前未知的机制进行性别分配决策，能够基于声学信息覆盖内部语言模型的偏见，使用分布式频率信息而非仅依赖音高。

Abstract: Unlike text, speech conveys information about the speaker, such as gender, through acoustic cues like pitch. This gives rise to modality-specific bias concerns. For example, in speech translation (ST), when translating from languages with notional gender, such as English, into languages where gender-ambiguous terms referring to the speaker are assigned grammatical gender, the speaker's vocal characteristics may play a role in gender assignment. This risks misgendering speakers, whether through masculine defaults or vocal-based assumptions. Yet, how ST models make these decisions remains poorly understood. We investigate the mechanisms ST models use to assign gender to speaker-referring terms across three language pairs (en-es/fr/it), examining how training data patterns, internal language model (ILM) biases, and acoustic information interact. We find that models do not simply replicate term-specific gender associations from training data, but learn broader patterns of masculine prevalence. While the ILM exhibits strong masculine bias, models can override these preferences based on acoustic input. Using contrastive feature attribution on spectrograms, we reveal that the model with higher gender accuracy relies on a previously unknown mechanism: using first-person pronouns to link gendered terms back to the speaker, accessing gender information distributed across the frequency spectrum rather than concentrated in pitch.

TL;DR: RoParQ是一个专门评估闭卷多选题中跨释义一致性的基准，通过生成释义并筛选引发不一致置信度的样本来构建。提出了XParaCon评估指标来衡量模型鲁棒性，并通过基于推理的释义感知SFT策略显著提升了模型的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在回答释义问题时表现出不一致行为，表明它们依赖表层模式而非真正的语义理解。这限制了模型在实际应用中的可靠性。

Method: 从标准数据集生成释义，使用专有模型创建RoParQ基准；提出XParaCon评估指标量化鲁棒性；实施基于推理的释义感知SFT策略进行模型对齐。

Result: 经过针对性对齐的轻量级模型达到了与更大预训练模型相当的鲁棒性水平，显著提升了跨释义一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解了表层记忆问题，培养了更鲁棒可靠的LLMs，证明了针对性语义对齐策略的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit inconsistent behavior when answering paraphrased questions, suggesting a reliance on surface-level patterns rather than true semantic understanding. To address this limitation, we introduce RoParQ, a benchmark specifically constructed to evaluate cross-paraphrase consistency in closed-book multiple-choice QA. This benchmark is derived from standard datasets by generating paraphrases via proprietary models and selectively retaining examples that elicit inconsistent confidence from a judge model. We further propose XParaCon, a novel evaluation metric that quantifies a model's robustness by measuring the standard deviation of accuracies across question variants. Additionally, we implement a reasoning-based, paraphrase-aware Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategy designed to align models toward semantic invariance. Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted alignment significantly enhances robustness. Notably, fine-tuned lightweight models achieved consistency levels comparable to much larger pre-trained models. These results highlight the efficacy of our approach in mitigating superficial memorization and fostering more robust, reliable LLMs.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效识别大语言模型中编码特定技能的神经元，为理解模型内部机制提供了可解释的途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque. In this paper, we introduce a simple, lightweight, and broadly applicable method with a focus on isolating neurons that encode specific skills. Building upon prior work that identified "skill neurons" via soft prompt training on classification tasks, our approach extends the analysis to complex scenarios involving multiple skills. We correlate neuron activations with auxiliary metrics -- such as external labels and the model's own confidence score -- thereby uncovering interpretable and task-specific behaviors without the need for manual token aggregation. We empirically validate our method on tasks spanning open-ended text generation and natural language inference, demonstrating its ability to detect neurons that not only drive known skills but also reveal previously unidentified shortcuts in arithmetic reasoning on BigBench.

Conclusion: 研究为整合元数据改进LLM预训练的效率和效果提供了实用指南，证明多种元数据类型都能带来训练加速效益。

Abstract: Incorporating metadata in Large Language Models (LLMs) pretraining has recently emerged as a promising approach to accelerate training. However prior work highlighted only one useful signal-URLs, leaving open the question of whether other forms of metadata could yield greater benefits. In this study, we investigate a wider range of metadata types and find other types of metadata, such as fine-grained indicators of document quality that can also accelerate pretraining when prepended. We identify a common feature among effective metadata: they encode information at a finer granularity. We further introduce metadata appending as a means of improving training efficiency, where predicting an appropriate metadata as auxiliary task can help speed up pretraining. In addition, learnable meta-tokens trained with masked loss can recover part of the speedup by inducing quality-aware latent structure. Using probing, we analyze latent representations to understand how metadata shapes learning. Together, these results yield practical guidelines for integrating metadata to improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of LLM pretraining.

Motivation: 大多数AI诗歌研究集中在英语，本研究旨在探讨捷克语（形态复杂、训练数据较少的斯拉夫语言）AI诗歌的感知和审美评价。

Method: 让捷克母语者识别和评价AI与人类创作的诗歌，使用逻辑回归模型分析识别准确率与审美评价的关系。

Result: 参与者识别准确率接近随机水平，审美评价显示强烈的作者偏见，诗歌喜爱度与准确识别作者呈负相关，诗歌熟悉度和文学背景不影响识别准确性。

Conclusion: AI能够令人信服地创作捷克语诗歌，读者对作者身份的信念与诗歌审美评价相互关联。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly capable of producing creative texts, yet most studies on AI-generated poetry focus on English -- a language that dominates training data. In this paper, we examine the perception of AI- and human-written Czech poetry. We ask if Czech native speakers are able to identify it and how they aesthetically judge it. Participants performed at chance level when guessing authorship (45.8\% correct on average), indicating that Czech AI-generated poems were largely indistinguishable from human-written ones. Aesthetic evaluations revealed a strong authorship bias: when participants believed a poem was AI-generated, they rated it as less favorably, even though AI poems were in fact rated equally or more favorably than human ones on average. The logistic regression model uncovered that the more the people liked a poem, the less probable was that they accurately assign the authorship. Familiarity with poetry or literary background had no effect on recognition accuracy. Our findings show that AI can convincingly produce poetry even in a morphologically complex, low-resource (with respect of the training data of AI models) Slavic language such as Czech. The results suggest that readers' beliefs about authorship and the aesthetic evaluation of the poem are interconnected.

Motivation: 现有的多智能体合成框架通常依赖中央协调器，存在可扩展性瓶颈，或者针对特定领域硬编码，缺乏灵活性。需要一种能够高效处理协调多智能体工作流的解决方案。

Method: 采用去中心化设计，将控制和数据流表示为通过分布式队列传递的序列化消息。每个任务通过轻量级智能体独立推进，计算密集型操作由分布式服务处理。基于Ray构建，支持模块化配置。

Result: 在多种合成场景（多智能体协作对话、基于网络的推理数据提取、客户服务环境中的工具使用轨迹生成）中，Matrix在相同硬件资源下实现了2-15倍的数据生成吞吐量提升，且不牺牲输出质量。

Conclusion: Matrix框架通过去中心化架构有效解决了多智能体数据生成的可扩展性和灵活性挑战，为大规模合成数据生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Synthetic data has become increasingly important for training large language models, especially when real data is scarce, expensive, or privacy-sensitive. Many such generation tasks require coordinated multi-agent workflows, where specialized agents collaborate to produce data that is higher quality, more diverse, and structurally richer. However, existing frameworks for multi-agent synthesis often depend on a centralized orchestrator, creating scalability bottlenecks, or are hardcoded for specific domains, limiting flexibility. We present \textbf{Matrix}, a decentralized framework that represents both control and data flow as serialized messages passed through distributed queues. This peer-to-peer design eliminates the central orchestrator. Each task progresses independently through lightweight agents, while compute-intensive operations, such as LLM inference or containerized environments, are handled by distributed services. Built on Ray, Matrix scales to tens of thousands of concurrent agentic workflows and provides a modular, configurable design that enables easy adaptation to a wide range of data generation workflows. We evaluate Matrix across diverse synthesis scenarios, such as multi-agent collaborative dialogue, web-based reasoning data extraction, and tool-use trajectory generation in customer service environments. In all cases, Matrix achieves $2$--$15\times$ higher data generation throughput under identical hardware resources, without compromising output quality.

Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然功能强大，但在解决深度复杂问题（如Humanity's Last Exam）时仍面临概念挑战和计算成本高的问题。

Method: 使用强化学习训练小型编排器，结合结果、效率和用户偏好的奖励机制，协调多种智能工具。

Result: Orchestrator（8B模型）在HLE上获得37.1%得分，超越GPT-5（35.1%）且效率提高2.5倍；在其他基准测试中也大幅超越GPT-5，成本仅约30%。

Conclusion: 使用轻量级编排模型组合多样化工具比现有方法更高效有效，为实用和可扩展的工具增强推理系统铺平道路。

Abstract: Large language models are powerful generalists, yet solving deep and complex problems such as those of the Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) remains both conceptually challenging and computationally expensive. We show that small orchestrators managing other models and a variety of tools can both push the upper bound of intelligence and improve efficiency in solving difficult agentic tasks. We introduce ToolOrchestra, a method for training small orchestrators that coordinate intelligent tools. ToolOrchestra explicitly uses reinforcement learning with outcome-, efficiency-, and user-preference-aware rewards. Using ToolOrchestra, we produce Orchestrator, an 8B model that achieves higher accuracy at lower cost than previous tool-use agents while aligning with user preferences on which tools are to be used for a given query. On HLE, Orchestrator achieves a score of 37.1%, outperforming GPT-5 (35.1%) while being 2.5x more efficient. On tau2-Bench and FRAMES, Orchestrator surpasses GPT-5 by a wide margin while using only about 30% of the cost. Extensive analysis shows that Orchestrator achieves the best trade-off between performance and cost under multiple metrics, and generalizes robustly to unseen tools. These results demonstrate that composing diverse tools with a lightweight orchestration model is both more efficient and more effective than existing methods, paving the way for practical and scalable tool-augmented reasoning systems.

### [163] [Revisiting Generalization Across Difficulty Levels: It's Not So Easy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21692)
*Yeganeh Kordi,Nihal V. Nayak,Max Zuo,Ilana Nguyen,Stephen H. Bach*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过系统评估大语言模型在不同任务难度下的泛化能力，发现跨难度泛化通常有限，训练数据中需要包含各种难度级别的样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对于在较易或较难数据上训练是否能带来更好结果存在分歧，且不清楚这些收益是体现在较易还是较难的测试数据上。

Method: 使用数千个不同LLM的输出和项目反应理论(IRT)对六个数据集中的示例进行难度排序，仅基于LLM能力确定难度评级，排除人类主观判断。

Result: 跨难度泛化通常有限；在较易或较难数据上训练无法在完整难度范围内实现一致的改进。

Conclusion: 在LLM的训练和评估数据中包含各种难度级别很重要，在难度方面走捷径是有风险的。

Abstract: We investigate how well large language models (LLMs) generalize across different task difficulties, a key question for effective data curation and evaluation. Existing research is mixed regarding whether training on easier or harder data leads to better results, and whether those gains come on easier or harder test data. We address this question by conducting a systematic evaluation of LLMs' generalization across models, datasets, and fine-grained groups of example difficulty. We rank examples in six datasets using the outputs of thousands of different LLMs and Item Response Theory (IRT), a well-established difficulty metric in educational testing. Unlike prior work, our difficulty ratings are therefore determined solely by the abilities of many different LLMs, excluding human opinions of difficulty. With a more objective, larger-scale, and finer-grained analysis, we show that cross-difficulty generalization is often limited; training on either easy or hard data cannot achieve consistent improvements across the full range of difficulties. These results show the importance of having a range of difficulties in both training and evaluation data for LLMs, and that taking shortcuts with respect to difficulty is risky.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统体素网格方法在实时和资源受限场景中存在内存效率低、计算开销大和GPU支持不足的问题，需要更高效的3D重建方案。

Method: 使用动态调整体素大小的方差自适应多分辨率体素网格，采用平面空间哈希表存储所有体素块，支持GPU并行处理。

Result: 相比固定分辨率基线，实现13倍加速和4倍内存使用降低，同时保持相当的3D重建精度。

Conclusion: 该方法为高性能3D重建提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案，特别适用于实时和资源受限场景。

Abstract: Efficient and scalable 3D surface reconstruction from range data remains a core challenge in computer graphics and vision, particularly in real-time and resource-constrained scenarios. Traditional volumetric methods based on fixed-resolution voxel grids or hierarchical structures like octrees often suffer from memory inefficiency, computational overhead, and a lack of GPU support. We propose a novel variance-adaptive, multi-resolution voxel grid that dynamically adjusts voxel size based on the local variance of signed distance field (SDF) observations. Unlike prior multi-resolution approaches that rely on recursive octree structures, our method leverages a flat spatial hash table to store all voxel blocks, supporting constant-time access and full GPU parallelism. This design enables high memory efficiency and real-time scalability. We further demonstrate how our representation supports GPU-accelerated rendering through a parallel quad-tree structure for Gaussian Splatting, enabling effective control over splat density. Our open-source CUDA/C++ implementation achieves up to 13x speedup and 4x lower memory usage compared to fixed-resolution baselines, while maintaining on par results in terms of reconstruction accuracy, offering a practical and extensible solution for high-performance 3D reconstruction.

### [165] [Minimizing Hyperbolic Embedding Distortion with LLM-Guided Hierarchy Restructuring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20679)
*Melika Ayoughi,Pascal Mettes,Paul Groth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究使用大语言模型自动重构层次结构以优化双曲嵌入质量，通过提示方法将现有层次结构转换为符合双曲嵌入理想标准的结构，实验证明重构后的层次结构能产生更高质量的双曲嵌入。

Motivation: 双曲嵌入的质量与输入层次结构密切相关，而最佳双曲嵌入需要高分支因子和单继承特性。为了帮助知识工程师重新组织层次知识，研究LLM是否能够自动重构层次结构以满足这些标准。

Method: 提出基于提示的方法，使用LLM在已知双曲嵌入理想标准的指导下转换现有层次结构。在16个不同层次结构上进行实验验证。

Result: 实验结果显示，LLM重构的层次结构在多个标准嵌入质量指标上始终产生更高质量的双曲嵌入。同时，LLM引导的层次重构能够实现可解释的重组，为知识工程师提供理由说明。

Conclusion: LLM能够有效自动重构层次结构以优化双曲嵌入质量，提供了一种可解释的层次重组方法，有助于知识工程应用。

Abstract: Hyperbolic geometry is an effective geometry for embedding hierarchical data structures. Hyperbolic learning has therefore become increasingly prominent in machine learning applications where data is hierarchically organized or governed by hierarchical semantics, ranging from recommendation systems to computer vision. The quality of hyperbolic embeddings is tightly coupled to the structure of the input hierarchy, which is often derived from knowledge graphs or ontologies. Recent work has uncovered that for an optimal hyperbolic embedding, a high branching factor and single inheritance are key, while embedding algorithms are robust to imbalance and hierarchy size. To assist knowledge engineers in reorganizing hierarchical knowledge, this paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) have the ability to automatically restructure hierarchies to meet these criteria. We propose a prompt-based approach to transform existing hierarchies using LLMs, guided by known desiderata for hyperbolic embeddings. Experiments on 16 diverse hierarchies show that LLM-restructured hierarchies consistently yield higher-quality hyperbolic embeddings across several standard embedding quality metrics. Moreover, we show how LLM-guided hierarchy restructuring enables explainable reorganizations, providing justifications to knowledge engineers.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative AI necessitates robust safety evaluations. However, current safety datasets are predominantly English-centric, failing to capture specific risks in non-English, socio-cultural contexts such as Korean, and are often limited to the text modality. To address this gap, we introduce AssurAI, a new quality-controlled Korean multimodal dataset for evaluating the safety of generative AI. First, we define a taxonomy of 35 distinct AI risk factors, adapted from established frameworks by a multidisciplinary expert group to cover both universal harms and relevance to the Korean socio-cultural context. Second, leveraging this taxonomy, we construct and release AssurAI, a large-scale Korean multimodal dataset comprising 11,480 instances across text, image, video, and audio. Third, we apply the rigorous quality control process used to ensure data integrity, featuring a two-phase construction (i.e., expert-led seeding and crowdsourced scaling), triple independent annotation, and an iterative expert red-teaming loop. Our pilot study validates AssurAI's effectiveness in assessing the safety of recent LLMs. We release AssurAI to the public to facilitate the development of safer and more reliable generative AI systems for the Korean community.

Conclusion: A²Flow通过完全自动化的算子提取和工作流生成，显著提升了智能体工作流设计的效率和性能，为自动化工作流设计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in automating the design of agentic workflows. However, existing methods still rely heavily on manually predefined operators, limiting generalization and scalability. To address this issue, we propose $A^2Flow$, a fully automated framework for agentic workflow generation based on self-adaptive abstraction operators. $A^2Flow$ employs a three-stage operator extraction process: 1) Case-based Initial Operator Generation: leveraging expert demonstrations and LLM reasoning to generate case-specific operators; 2) Operator Clustering and Preliminary Abstraction: grouping similar operators across tasks to form preliminary abstractions; and 3) Deep Extraction for Abstract Execution Operators: applying long chain-of-thought prompting and multi-path reasoning to derive compact and generalizable execution operators. These operators serve as reusable building blocks for workflow construction without manual predefinition. Furthermore, we enhance node-level workflow search with an operator memory mechanism, which retains historical outputs to enrich context and improve decision-making. Experiments on general and embodied benchmarks show that $A^2Flow$ achieves a 2.4\% and 19.3\% average performance improvement and reduces resource usage by 37\% over state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Scientific reasoning through Large Language Models in heliophysics involves more than just recalling facts: it requires incorporating physical assumptions, maintaining consistent units, and providing clear scientific formats through coordinated approaches. To address these challenges, we present Reasoning With a Star, a newly contributed heliophysics dataset applicable to reasoning; we also provide an initial benchmarking approach. Our data are constructed from National Aeronautics and Space Administration & University Corporation for Atmospheric Research Living With a Star summer school problem sets and compiled into a readily consumable question-and-answer structure with question contexts, reasoning steps, expected answer type, ground-truth targets, format hints, and metadata. A programmatic grader checks the predictions using unit-aware numerical tolerance, symbolic equivalence, and schema validation. We benchmark a single-shot baseline and four multi-agent patterns, finding that decomposing workflows through systems engineering principles outperforms direct prompting on problems requiring deductive reasoning rather than pure inductive recall.

Abstract: Emerging from NASA's spacecraft simulations in the 1960s, digital twin technology has advanced through industrial adoption to spark a healthcare transformation. A digital twin is a dynamic, data-driven virtual counterpart of a physical system, continuously updated through real-time data streams and capable of bidirectional interaction. In medicine, digital twin integrates imaging, biosensors, and computational models to generate patient-specific simulations that support diagnosis, treatment planning, and drug development. Representative applications include cardiac digital twin for predicting arrhythmia treatment outcomes, oncology digital twin for tracking tumor progression and optimizing radiotherapy, and pharmacological digital twin for accelerating drug discovery. Despite rapid progress, major challenges, including interoperability, data privacy, and model fidelity, continue to limit widespread clinical integration. Emerging solutions such as explainable AI, federated learning, and harmonized regulatory frameworks offer promising pathways forward. Looking ahead, advances in multi-organ digital twin, genomics integration, and ethical governance will be essential to ensure that digital twin shifts healthcare from reactive treatment to predictive, preventive, and truly personalized medicine.

TL;DR: 本文对多模态思维链在多领域数据集上的泛化能力进行了全面分析，发现虽然视觉特征能减少推理幻觉，但思维链在不同问题类型中的有效性差异显著，特别是在常识推理方面存在挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多模态思维链在科学推理之外的多样化领域（如常识推理）中的泛化能力，因为现有方法主要在科学问答基准上表现出色，但在其他领域的适用性尚未充分研究。

Method: 采用Zhang等人提出的两阶段框架，将推理生成与答案推断分离，通过门控融合机制将视觉特征与基于T5的语言模型集成，并在A-OKVQA、OKVQA和ChartQA数据集上进行系统消融研究。

Result: 视觉集成显著减少了推理生成中的幻觉，但思维链推理的有效性在不同问题类型间差异很大，常识推理尤其具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为研究人员实现多模态推理系统提供了实用见解，并确定了跨领域泛化未来改进的关键方向。

Abstract: While recent work has extended CoT to multimodal settings, achieving state-of-the-art results on science question answering benchmarks like ScienceQA, the generalizability of these approaches across diverse domains remains underexplored. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Multimodal-CoT) reasoning, evaluating its effectiveness on the A-OKVQA, OKVQA and ChartQA datasets, which requires broad commonsense and world knowledge beyond scientific reasoning. We implement the two-stage framework proposed by Zhang et al. [3], which separates rationale generation from answer inference and integrates vision features through a gated fusion mechanism with T5-based language models. Through systematic ablation studies, we analyze the contributions of vision features, rationale quality, and architectural choices. Our findings reveal that while vision integration significantly reduces hallucination in rationale generation, the effectiveness of CoT reasoning varies substantially across question types, with commonsense reasoning presenting particular challenges. This work provides practical insights for researchers implementing multimodal reasoning systems and identifies key areas for future improvement in cross-domain generalization.

Abstract: Multi-access point coordination (MAPC) is a key technology for enhancing throughput in next-generation Wi-Fi within dense overlapping basic service sets. However, existing MAPC protocols rely on static, protocol-defined rules, which limits their ability to adapt to dynamic network conditions such as varying interference levels and topologies. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Agentic AI Wi-Fi framework where each access point, modeled as an autonomous large language model agent, collaboratively reasons about the network state and negotiates adaptive coordination strategies in real time. This dynamic collaboration is achieved through a cognitive workflow that enables the agents to engage in natural language dialogue, leveraging integrated memory, reflection, and tool use to ground their decisions in past experience and environmental feedback. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that our agentic framework successfully learns to adapt to diverse and dynamic network environments, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art spatial reuse baseline and validating its potential as a robust and intelligent solution for future wireless networks.

TL;DR: OpenApps是一个轻量级开源生态系统，用于评估UI智能体在不同应用变体中的可靠性。研究发现，虽然智能体在固定应用中的表现相对稳定，但在不同应用变体中的成功率波动可达50%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估方法依赖固定环境，无法衡量智能体在不同应用设计和内容变体中的可靠性，而实际部署时会遇到各种应用变体。

Method: 开发了包含6个应用的OpenApps生态系统，可配置外观和内容，使用单个CPU即可运行数千个应用版本。进行了超过10,000次独立评估，研究7个领先多模态智能体在不同应用变体中的表现。

Result: 智能体在固定应用中的可靠性相对稳定，但在不同应用变体中的成功率波动很大。例如Kimi-VL-3B的平均成功率从63%波动到仅4%。智能体行为如循环或幻觉动作也因环境配置而异。

Conclusion: 测量智能体在不同应用变体中的可靠性是一个重要新维度，OpenApps为此提供了评估工具。

Abstract: Reliability is key to realizing the promise of autonomous UI-Agents, multimodal agents that directly interact with apps in the same manner as humans, as users must be able to trust an agent to complete a given task. Current evaluations rely on fixed environments, often clones of existing apps, which are limited in that they can only shed light on whether or how often an agent can complete a task within a specific environment. When deployed however, agents are likely to encounter variations in app design and content that can affect an agent's ability to complete a task. To address this blind spot of measuring agent reliability across app variations, we develop OpenApps, a light-weight open-source ecosystem with six apps (messenger, calendar, maps, etc.) that are configurable in appearance and content. OpenApps requires just a single CPU to run, enabling easy generation and deployment of thousands of versions of each app. Specifically, we run more than 10,000 independent evaluations to study reliability across seven leading multimodal agents. We find that while standard reliability within a fixed app is relatively stable, reliability can vary drastically when measured across app variations. Task success rates for many agents can fluctuate by more than $50\%$ across app variations. For example, Kimi-VL-3B's average success across all tasks fluctuates from $63\%$ to just $4\%$ across app versions. We also find agent behaviors such as looping or hallucinating actions can differ drastically depending on the environment configuration. These initial findings highlight the importance of measuring reliability along this new dimension of app variations. OpenApps is available at https://facebookresearch.github.io/OpenApps/

TL;DR: RILKE是一种在表示空间进行干预的知识控制方法，能够在不重新训练LLM的情况下高效更新复杂非结构化知识，同时保持模型通用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型经常产生错误或过时的内容，需要在不进行昂贵重新训练的情况下高效准确地更新其知识，特别是在终身学习环境中处理复杂非结构化知识时，多个编辑需要共存且互不干扰。

Method: RILKE将知识控制视为模型表示空间中的干预，学习具有抗释义性和编辑局部性的模块，将每个更新限制在低维子空间中以最小化交叉编辑干扰。在推理时，查询自适应路由器选择适当的模块来指导生成。

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen模型的知识编辑基准测试中，RILKE能够扩展到大规模数据集，表现出高编辑成功率、强释义泛化能力，并以适度的内存开销保持通用能力。

Conclusion: RILKE是LLM中终身知识控制的有效且可扩展的解决方案，能够在表示空间实现细粒度知识控制，同时保持基础权重冻结。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce incorrect or outdated content. Updating their knowledge efficiently and accurately without costly retraining is a major challenge. This problem is especially hard for complex, unstructured knowledge in a lifelong setting, where many edits must coexist without interference. We introduce RILKE (Representation Intervention for Lifelong KnowledgE Control), a robust and scalable method that treats knowledge control as interventions within the model's representation space. Leveraging representation-space expressiveness, we identify two properties enabling RILKE to deliver fine-grained control over complex, unstructured knowledge while maintaining general utility with frozen base weights. During training, RILKE learns paraphrase-robust and edit-localized modules that limit each update to a low-dimensional subspace to minimize cross-edit interference. In inference, a query-adaptive router selects the appropriate module to guide the model's generation. In evaluation on knowledge editing benchmarks with LLaMA and Qwen models, RILKE is scalable to large-scale datasets, demonstrating high edit success, strong paraphrase generalization, and preserving general utility with modest memory overhead. These results show RILKE is an effective and scalable solution for lifelong knowledge control in LLMs.

Abstract: While neurons are the basic units of deep neural networks, it is still unclear what they learn and if their knowledge is aligned with that of humans. Compositional explanations aim to answer this question by describing the spatial alignment between neuron activations and concepts through logical rules. These logical descriptions are typically computed via a search over all possible concept combinations. Since computing the spatial alignment over the entire state space is computationally infeasible, the literature commonly adopts beam search to restrict the space. However, beam search cannot provide any theoretical guarantees of optimality, and it remains unclear how close current explanations are to the true optimum. In this theoretical paper, we address this gap by introducing the first framework for computing guaranteed optimal compositional explanations. Specifically, we propose: (i) a decomposition that identifies the factors influencing the spatial alignment, (ii) a heuristic to estimate the alignment at any stage of the search, and (iii) the first algorithm that can compute optimal compositional explanations within a feasible time. Using this framework, we analyze the differences between optimal and non-optimal explanations in the most popular settings for compositional explanations, the computer vision domain and Convolutional Neural Networks. In these settings, we demonstrate that 10-40 percent of explanations obtained with beam search are suboptimal when overlapping concepts are involved. Finally, we evaluate a beam-search variant guided by our proposed decomposition and heuristic, showing that it matches or improves runtime over prior methods while offering greater flexibility in hyperparameters and computational resources.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ENACT是一个评估具身认知的基准，通过视觉问答形式测试模型从自我中心交互中进行世界建模的能力，包含前向和逆向世界建模两个任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索现代视觉语言模型是否表现出具身认知的迹象，尽管它们大多以非具身方式训练。具身认知认为智能源于感知运动交互而非被动观察。

Method: 将具身认知评估构建为部分可观察马尔可夫决策过程，动作是场景图变化。包含两个序列重排序任务：前向世界建模（给定动作重排观察序列）和逆向世界建模（给定观察重排动作序列）。

Result: 实验显示前沿VLM与人类之间存在性能差距，且随着交互视野扩大而增大。模型在逆向任务上表现更好，并表现出人类中心偏见，如偏好右手动作，当相机参数或视角偏离人类视觉时性能下降。

Conclusion: ENACT基准揭示了VLM在具身认知能力上的局限性，为评估和推进具身AI提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Embodied cognition argues that intelligence arises from sensorimotor interaction rather than passive observation. It raises an intriguing question: do modern vision-language models (VLMs), trained largely in a disembodied manner, exhibit signs of embodied cognition? We introduce ENACT, a benchmark that casts evaluation of embodied cognition as world modeling from egocentric interaction in a visual question answering (VQA) format. Framed as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) whose actions are scene graph changes, ENACT comprises two complementary sequence reordering tasks: forward world modeling (reorder shuffled observations given actions) and inverse world modeling (reorder shuffled actions given observations). While conceptually simple, solving these tasks implicitly demands capabilities central to embodied cognition-affordance recognition, action-effect reasoning, embodied awareness, and interactive, long-horizon memory from partially observable egocentric input, while avoiding low-level image synthesis that could confound the evaluation. We provide a scalable pipeline that synthesizes QA pairs from robotics simulation (BEHAVIOR) and evaluates models on 8,972 QA pairs spanning long-horizon home-scale activities. Experiments reveal a performance gap between frontier VLMs and humans that widens with interaction horizon. Models consistently perform better on the inverse task than the forward one and exhibit anthropocentric biases, including a preference for right-handed actions and degradation when camera intrinsics or viewpoints deviate from human vision.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Ivy是一个AI教练系统，通过将符号化的Task-Method-Knowledge模型与生成式解释层结合，提供结构化、多步骤的解释，以改善LLM生成的解释质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在程序性技能学习中，教学解释不仅要传达步骤，还要传达背后的因果、目标导向和组合逻辑。LLM通常产生流畅但浅层的回答，缺乏这种结构。

Method: 结合符号化的TMK模型和生成式解释层，TMK编码因果转换、目标层次和问题分解，并在明确的结构边界内指导LLM。

Result: 与GPT和检索增强GPT基线相比，符号约束持续改善了"如何"和"为什么"问题解释的结构质量。

Conclusion: 这项研究展示了一种可扩展的AI教育方法，增强了智能教练系统中AI生成解释的教学价值。

Abstract: In procedural skill learning, instructional explanations must convey not just steps, but the causal, goal-directed, and compositional logic behind them. Large language models (LLMs) often produce fluent yet shallow responses that miss this structure. We present Ivy, an AI coaching system that delivers structured, multi-step explanations by combining symbolic Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) models with a generative interpretation layer-an LLM that constructs explanations while being constrained by TMK structure. TMK encodes causal transitions, goal hierarchies, and problem decompositions, and guides the LLM within explicit structural bounds. We evaluate Ivy against responses against GPT and retrieval-augmented GPT baselines using expert and independent annotations across three inferential dimensions. Results show that symbolic constraints consistently improve the structural quality of explanations for "how" and "why" questions. This study demonstrates a scalable AI for education approach that strengthens the pedagogical value of AI-generated explanations in intelligent coaching systems.

*Jinpeng Wang,Chao Li,Ting Ye,Mengyuan Zhang,Wei Liu,Jian Luan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了ICPO方法，通过利用LLM生成不同响应的概率来反映其推理过程的自评估，结合偏好优势分数和可验证奖励来提升推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法存在粗粒度奖励、奖励噪声和低效探索等问题，导致训练不稳定和熵崩溃，需要改进。

Method: ICPO方法计算每个响应的偏好优势分数，通过比较同一输入提示下多个响应的相对生成概率，并将该分数与可验证奖励结合来指导探索过程。

Result: 在四个通用领域基准和三个数学基准上的综合实验表明，ICPO相比GRPO能稳定提升推理能力。

Conclusion: ICPO方法有效缓解了粗粒度奖励和奖励噪声问题，抑制过度自信错误，增强被低估高质量响应的相对优势，防止模型对特定策略的过拟合，促进更彻底的探索。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) demonstrates significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RLVR methods are often constrained by issues such as coarse-grained rewards, reward noise, and inefficient exploration, which lead to unstable training and entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we propose the Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization method (ICPO). The intuition behind it lies in the fact that the probabilities of an LLM generating different responses can inherently and directly reflect its self-assessment of the reasoning process. Inspired by the idea of preference modeling, ICPO calculates a preference advantage score for each response by comparing the relative generation probabilities of multiple responses under the same input prompt, and integrates this score with verifiable rewards to guide the exploration process. We have discovered that the preference advantage score not only alleviates the issues of coarse-grained rewards and reward noise but also effectively curbs overconfident errors, enhances the relative superiority of undervalued high-quality responses, and prevents the model from overfitting to specific strategies, thereby facilitating more thorough exploration. Comprehensive experiments across four general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that ICPO steadily boosts reasoning compared to GRPO.

*Linze Chen,Yufan Cai,Zhe Hou,Jinsong Dong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: L4M是一个结合对抗性LLM代理和SMT求解器的法律推理框架，将自然语言解释的灵活性与符号验证的严谨性相结合，在法律基准测试中超越了现有先进LLM和法律AI系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM系统擅长表层文本分析，但缺乏原则性法理学所需的保证。法律理性表现为实质理性（结果公平性）和形式理性（遵循明确规则），需要将自然语言的解释灵活性与符号验证的严谨性统一起来。

Method: 三阶段流水线：1) 法规形式化：将法律条款转换为逻辑公式；2) 双方法律事实提取：检察官和辩护方对齐的LLM独立提取事实和法规；3) 求解器中心裁决：将双方论证编译为逻辑约束，通过不满足核心触发迭代自我批评，最终由法官LLM生成透明判决。

Result: 在公共基准测试中，该系统超越了GPT-4-mini、DeepSeek-V3、Claude 4等先进LLM以及最先进的法律AI基线，同时提供严格且可解释的符号证明。

Conclusion: L4M框架成功地将对抗性LLM代理与SMT求解器证明相结合，为法律推理提供了兼具解释灵活性和验证严谨性的解决方案，实现了超越现有系统的性能并提供可解释的符号证明。

Abstract: The rationality of law manifests in two forms: substantive rationality, which concerns the fairness or moral desirability of outcomes, and formal rationality, which requires legal decisions to follow explicitly stated, general, and logically coherent rules. Existing LLM-based systems excel at surface-level text analysis but lack the guarantees required for principled jurisprudence. We introduce L4M, a novel framework that combines adversarial LLM agents with SMT-solver-backed proofs to unite the interpretive flexibility of natural language with the rigor of symbolic verification. The pipeline consists of three phases: (1) Statute Formalization, where domain-specific prompts convert legal provisions into logical formulae; (2) Dual Fact and Statute Extraction, in which prosecutor- and defense-aligned LLMs independently map case narratives to fact tuples and statutes, ensuring role isolation; and (3) Solver-Centric Adjudication, where an autoformalizer compiles both parties' arguments into logic constraints, and unsat cores trigger iterative self-critique until a satisfiable formula is achieved, which is then verbalized by a Judge-LLM into a transparent verdict and optimized sentence. Experimental results on public benchmarks show that our system surpasses advanced LLMs including GPT-o4-mini, DeepSeek-V3, and Claude 4 as well as state-of-the-art Legal AI baselines, while providing rigorous and explainable symbolic justifications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OVOD-Agent通过将被动类别匹配转变为主动视觉推理和自我演进检测，提出了基于视觉CoT和w-MDP框架的开放词汇目标检测方法，在COCO和LVIS数据集上取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OVOD方法虽然在多模态数据上预训练，但推理仍局限于固定类别名称，造成多模态训练与单模态推理之间的差距。文本空间优化能显著提升OVOD性能，表明文本表示仍有探索空间。

Method: 提出OVOD-Agent框架：1）将文本优化过程扩展为可解释的视觉CoT；2）在八个状态空间上建模为弱马尔可夫决策过程；3）引入Bandit模块生成探索信号；4）集成马尔可夫转移矩阵与Bandit轨迹进行自监督奖励模型优化。

Result: 在COCO和LVIS数据集上的实验表明，OVOD-Agent在各种OVOD骨干网络上均提供了一致的改进，特别是在稀有类别上表现突出。

Conclusion: OVOD-Agent通过主动视觉推理和自我演进检测框架，有效提升了开放词汇目标检测的性能，证明了所提出框架的有效性。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) aims to enable detectors to generalize across categories by leveraging semantic information. Although existing methods are pretrained on large vision-language datasets, their inference is still limited to fixed category names, creating a gap between multimodal training and unimodal inference. Previous work has shown that improving textual representation can significantly enhance OVOD performance, indicating that the textual space is still underexplored. To this end, we propose OVOD-Agent, which transforms passive category matching into proactive visual reasoning and self-evolving detection. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm, OVOD-Agent extends the textual optimization process into an interpretable Visual-CoT with explicit actions. OVOD's lightweight nature makes LLM-based management unsuitable; instead, we model visual context transitions as a Weakly Markovian Decision Process (w-MDP) over eight state spaces, which naturally represents the agent's state, memory, and interaction dynamics. A Bandit module generates exploration signals under limited supervision, helping the agent focus on uncertain regions and adapt its detection policy. We further integrate Markov transition matrices with Bandit trajectories for self-supervised Reward Model (RM) optimization, forming a closed loop from Bandit exploration to RM learning. Experiments on COCO and LVIS show that OVOD-Agent provides consistent improvements across OVOD backbones, particularly on rare categories, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

*Joseph Y. Halpern,Rafael Pass*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了Halpern-Pearl因果定义的抽象版本，使其能应用于任何定义了反事实的模型，扩展了因果关系的适用范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Halpern-Pearl的因果定义局限于因果模型，无法处理包含析取、否定、信念和嵌套反事实的复杂公式。本文旨在抽象该定义的核心特征，使其适用于更广泛的模型。

Method: 通过提取Halpern-Pearl因果定义的关键特征，构建了一个抽象定义框架，使其能应用于任何定义了反事实的模型，包括允许回溯的模型。

Result: 成功开发了一个抽象的因果定义，不仅能处理更复杂的逻辑公式，还能扩展到解释概念的定义，并在因果模型中获得了更深入的理解。

Conclusion: 抽象化的Halpern-Pearl因果定义显著扩展了其适用范围，为在更广泛模型中定义因果关系和解释提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Perhaps the most prominent current definition of (actual) causality is due to Halpern and Pearl.  It is defined using causal models (also known as structural equations models).  We abstract the definition, extracting its key features, so that it can be applied to any other model where counterfactuals are defined. By abstracting the definition, we gain a number of benefits. Not only can we apply the definition in a wider range of models, including ones that allow, for example, backtracking, but we can apply the definition to determine if A is a cause of B  even if A and B are formulas involving disjunctions, negations, beliefs, and nested counterfactuals (none of which can be handled by the Halpern-Pearl definition). Moreover, we can extend the ideas to getting an abstract definition of explanation that can be applied beyond causal models. Finally, we gain a deeper understanding of features of the definition  even in causal models.

*Jiayuan Zhang,Kaiquan Chen,Zhihao Lu,Enshen Zhou,Qian Yu,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Prune4Web是一个新颖的网页自动化方法，通过将DOM处理从资源密集的LLM阅读转向高效的程序化修剪，实现了25-50倍的候选元素减少，显著提升了动作定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于LLM的网页代理在处理复杂真实网页时面临的DOM结构过大（10,000-100,000个token）问题，现有方法依赖粗略的DOM截断或低效启发式方法，无法在精度和可扩展性之间取得平衡。

Method: 提出DOM树修剪编程方法，让LLM生成可执行的Python评分脚本来动态过滤DOM元素，基于分解的子任务语义线索。该方法将遍历和评分委托给轻量级可解释程序，避免LLM直接处理原始大型DOM。

Result: 在低级别接地任务上，准确率从46.8%大幅提升至88.28%，实现了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: Prune4Web通过程序化修剪范式有效解决了网页自动化中的DOM处理瓶颈，在保持精度的同时实现了显著的可扩展性改进。

Abstract: Web automation employs intelligent agents to execute high-level tasks by mimicking human interactions with web interfaces. Despite the capabilities of recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents, navigating complex, real-world webpages efficiently remains a significant hurdle due to the prohibitively large size of Document Object Model (DOM) structures, often ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 tokens. Existing strategies typically rely on crude DOM truncation -- risking the loss of critical information -- or employ inefficient heuristics and separate ranking models, failing to achieve an optimal balance between precision and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce Prune4Web, a novel paradigm that shifts DOM processing from resource-intensive LLM reading to efficient programmatic pruning. Central to our approach is DOM Tree Pruning Programming, where an LLM generates executable Python scoring scripts to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic cues from decomposed sub-tasks. This mechanism eliminates the need for LLMs to ingest raw, massive DOMs, instead delegating traversal and scoring to lightweight, interpretable programs. This methodology achieves a 25x to 50x reduction in candidate elements for grounding, thereby facilitating precise action localization while mitigating attention dilution. Furthermore, we propose a specialized data annotation pipeline and a two-turn dialogue training strategy that jointly optimizes the Planner, Programmatic Filter, and Grounder within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on our low-level grounding task, Prune4Web dramatically improves accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28%, underscoring its efficacy in real-world web automation.

Motivation: 传统药物重定位预测需要多领域专家协作，现有工具碎片化且数据异构，工作流程不顺畅。需要让临床专家无需计算机专业知识也能进行复杂分析。

Method: 基于NeDRex知识图谱构建多智能体系统，包含查询路由、数据检索、算法执行、结果可视化等专门智能体，支持网络分析、功能一致性评估、文献挖掘等任务。

Result: 系统实现了自然语言访问生物医学知识图谱，能够执行复杂的生物信息学分析，支持药物重定位预测和科学背景讨论。

Conclusion: ChatDRex使临床专家能够生成假设并探索药物重定位机会，加速新疗法发现，推动个性化医疗和转化研究。

Abstract: Repurposing approved drugs offers a time-efficient and cost-effective alternative to traditional drug development. However, in silico prediction of repurposing candidates is challenging and requires the effective collaboration of specialists in various fields, including pharmacology, medicine, biology, and bioinformatics. Fragmented, specialized algorithms and tools often address only narrow aspects of the overall problem, and heterogeneous, unstructured data landscapes require specialized users to be involved. Hence, these data services do not integrate smoothly across workflows. With ChatDRex, we present a conversation-based, multi-agent system that facilitates the execution of complex bioinformatic analyses aiming for network-based drug repurposing prediction. It builds on the integrated systems medicine knowledge graph NeDRex. ChatDRex provides natural language access to its extensive biomedical KG and integrates bioinformatics agents for network analysis and drug repurposing, complemented by agents for functional coherence evaluation for in silico validation, as well as agents for literature mining and for discussing the obtained results in a scientific context. Its flexible multi-agent design assigns specific tasks to specialized agents, including query routing, data retrieval, algorithm execution, and result visualization. A dedicated reasoning module keeps the user in the loop and allows for hallucination detection. By enabling physicians and researchers without computer science expertise to control complex analyses in natural language, ChatDRex democratizes access to bioinformatics as an important resource for drug repurposing. It enables clinical experts to generate hypotheses and explore drug repurposing opportunities, ultimately accelerating the discovery of novel therapies and advancing personalized medicine and translational research.

Conclusion: EWE标志着向自动科学发现迈出的一步，具有民主化专业知识和智力资源的潜力，特别有利于易受极端天气影响的发展中国家。

Abstract: Extreme weather events pose escalating risks to global society, underscoring the urgent need to unravel their underlying physical mechanisms. Yet the prevailing expert-driven, labor-intensive diagnostic paradigm has created a critical analytical bottleneck, stalling scientific progress. While AI for Earth Science has achieved notable advances in prediction, the equally essential challenge of automated diagnostic reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present the Extreme Weather Expert (EWE), the first intelligent agent framework dedicated to this task. EWE emulates expert workflows through knowledge-guided planning, closed-loop reasoning, and a domain-tailored meteorological toolkit. It autonomously produces and interprets multimodal visualizations from raw meteorological data, enabling comprehensive diagnostic analyses. To catalyze progress, we introduce the first benchmark for this emerging field, comprising a curated dataset of 103 high-impact events and a novel step-wise evaluation metric. EWE marks a step toward automated scientific discovery and offers the potential to democratize expertise and intellectual resources, particularly for developing nations vulnerable to extreme weather.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法计算成本高或过度拒绝安全指令的问题，确保具身AI在家庭环境中的安全部署。

Method: 使用多个LLM智能体辩论指令安全性，关键评估器基于逻辑性、风险识别、证据质量和清晰度评分，通过迭代审议和共识投票达成决策。

Result: 在AI2-THOR和VirtualHome实验中，拒绝90%以上不安全任务，同时保持低安全任务拒绝率，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提供可扩展、模型无关的解决方案，用于构建可信赖的具身智能体。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of embodied AI agents during task planning is critical for real-world deployment, especially in household environments where dangerous instructions pose significant risks. Existing methods often suffer from either high computational costs due to preference alignment training or over-rejection when using single-agent safety prompts. To address these limitations, we propose MADRA, a training-free Multi-Agent Debate Risk Assessment framework that leverages collective reasoning to enhance safety awareness without sacrificing task performance. MADRA employs multiple LLM-based agents to debate the safety of a given instruction, guided by a critical evaluator that scores responses based on logical soundness, risk identification, evidence quality, and clarity. Through iterative deliberation and consensus voting, MADRA significantly reduces false rejections while maintaining high sensitivity to dangerous tasks. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical cognitive collaborative planning framework that integrates safety, memory, planning, and self-evolution mechanisms to improve task success rates through continuous learning. We also contribute SafeAware-VH, a benchmark dataset for safety-aware task planning in VirtualHome, containing 800 annotated instructions. Extensive experiments on AI2-THOR and VirtualHome demonstrate that our approach achieves over 90% rejection of unsafe tasks while ensuring that safe-task rejection is low, outperforming existing methods in both safety and execution efficiency. Our work provides a scalable, model-agnostic solution for building trustworthy embodied agents.

Motivation: 现有基准测试过度简化空间认知，将其简化为单一维度指标，无法捕捉空间能力的层次结构和相互依赖关系。

Method: 构建分层空间认知框架，将空间智能分为五个认知层次，开发SpatialBench大规模细粒度基准，包含15个任务，并引入能力导向的统一评估指标。

Result: 大规模实验显示MLLMs在不同认知层次上表现分层：感知基础能力强，但在符号推理、因果推理和规划方面有限。人类测试表明人类进行选择性目标导向抽象，而MLLMs倾向于过度关注表面细节。

Conclusion: 建立了首个系统测量MLLMs分层空间认知的框架，为未来空间智能系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Spatial cognition is fundamental to real-world multimodal intelligence, allowing models to effectively interact with the physical environment. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides, existing benchmarks often oversimplify spatial cognition, reducing it to a single-dimensional metric, which fails to capture the hierarchical structure and interdependence of spatial abilities. To address this gap, we propose a hierarchical spatial cognition framework that decomposes spatial intelligence into five progressively complex levels from basic observation to high-level planning. Building upon this taxonomy, we construct SpatialBench, a large-scale, fine-grained benchmark covering 15 tasks aligned with these cognitive levels. To provide a unified evaluation across heterogeneous tasks, we further introduce a high-level capability-oriented metric that reliably assesses a model's overall spatial reasoning ability. Extensive experiments over massive MLLMs reveal distinct performance stratification across cognitive levels: models exhibit strong perceptual grounding yet remain limited in symbolic reasoning, causal inference, and planning. Additional human tests demonstrate that humans perform selective, goal-directed abstraction, while MLLMs tend to over-attend to surface details without coherent spatial intent. Our work establishes the first systematic framework for measuring hierarchical spatial cognition in MLLMs, laying the foundation for future spatially intelligent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有验证性能的关键限制在于错误检测能力，需要更有效的验证方法来提高数学问题的可靠性。

Method: 设计悲观验证变体，为同一证明构建多个并行验证，只要任一验证报告错误就判定证明不正确。

Result: 该方法在多个数学验证基准上显著提升性能，计算资源消耗低，token效率甚至超过扩展长链思维方法。

Conclusion: 悲观验证能有效提高语言模型输出的可靠性，在长视野数学任务中发挥关键作用，有助于增强语言模型的数学能力。

Abstract: The key limitation of the verification performance lies in the ability of error detection. With this intuition we designed several variants of pessimistic verification, which are simple workflows that could significantly improve the verification of open-ended math questions. In pessimistic verification we construct multiple parallel verifications for the same proof, and the proof is deemed incorrect if any one of them reports an error. This simple technique significantly improves the performance across many math verification benchmarks without incurring substantial computational resources. Its token efficiency even surpassed extended long-CoT in test-time scaling. Our case studies further indicate that the majority of false negatives in stronger models are actually caused by annotation errors in the original dataset, so our method's performance is in fact underestimated. Self-verification for mathematical problems can effectively improve the reliability and performance of language model outputs, and it also plays a critical role in enabling long-horizon mathematical tasks. We believe that research on pessimistic verification will help enhance the mathematical capabilities of language models across a wide range of tasks.

TL;DR: 语言模型在专业领域无法可靠披露AI身份，导致用户无法信任其能力边界。研究发现模型在专业角色扮演中自我透明度存在严重不一致性，某些领域透明度高而其他领域低，造成用户过度泛化信任的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在专业高风险领域，如果语言模型不能可靠地披露其AI身份，用户可能误判其专业能力边界，导致潜在危害。需要研究模型在不同专业角色中的自我透明度表现。

Method: 采用公共花园设计，对16个开放权重模型（4B-671B参数）进行19,200次试验审计，评估不同专业角色下的身份披露行为。使用贝叶斯验证和Rogan-Gladen校正确保测量可靠性。

Result: 模型在不同专业领域表现出显著不一致性：金融顾问角色初始披露率30.8%，而神经外科医生角色仅3.5%。披露率范围2.8%-73.6%，模型身份比参数数量更能预测行为。推理优化在某些模型中主动抑制了自我透明度。

Conclusion: 透明度反映训练因素而非规模，组织不能假设安全属性会转移到部署环境，需要刻意设计行为和实证验证。

Abstract: If a language model cannot reliably disclose its AI identity in expert contexts, users cannot trust its competence boundaries. This study examines self-transparency in models assigned professional personas within high-stakes domains where false expertise risks user harm. Using a common-garden design, sixteen open-weight models (4B--671B parameters) were audited across 19,200 trials. Models exhibited sharp domain-specific inconsistency: a Financial Advisor persona elicited 30.8% disclosure initially, while a Neurosurgeon persona elicited only 3.5%. This creates preconditions for a "Reverse Gell-Mann Amnesia" effect, where transparency in some domains leads users to overgeneralize trust to contexts where disclosure fails. Disclosure ranged from 2.8% to 73.6%, with a 14B model reaching 61.4% while a 70B produced just 4.1%. Model identity predicted behavior better than parameter count ($ΔR_{adj}^{2} = 0.359$ vs 0.018). Reasoning optimization actively suppressed self-transparency in some models, with reasoning variants showing up to 48.4% lower disclosure than base counterparts. Bayesian validation with Rogan--Gladen correction confirmed robustness to measurement error ($κ= 0.908$). These findings demonstrate transparency reflects training factors rather than scale. Organizations cannot assume safety properties transfer to deployment contexts, requiring deliberate behavior design and empirical verification.

Abstract: In an era marked by rapid technological advancements and complex global challenges, responsible foresight has emerged as an essential framework for policymakers aiming to navigate future uncertainties and shape the future. Responsible foresight entails the ethical anticipation of emerging opportunities and risks, with a focus on fostering proactive, sustainable, and accountable future design. This paper coins the term "responsible computational foresight", examining the role of human-centric artificial intelligence and computational modeling in advancing responsible foresight, establishing a set of foundational principles for this new field and presenting a suite of AI-driven foresight tools currently shaping it. AI, particularly in conjunction with simulations and scenario analysis, enhances policymakers' ability to address uncertainty, evaluate risks, and devise strategies geared toward sustainable, resilient futures. However, responsible foresight extends beyond mere technical forecasting; it demands a nuanced understanding of the interdependencies within social, environmental, economic and political systems, alongside a commitment to ethical, long-term decision-making that supports human intelligence. We argue that AI will play a role as a supportive tool in responsible, human-centered foresight, complementing rather than substituting policymaker judgment to enable the proactive shaping of resilient and ethically sound futures. This paper advocates for the thoughtful integration of AI into foresight practices to empower policymakers and communities as they confront the grand challenges of the 21st century.

*Charles Schepanowski,Charles Ling*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs在8拼图任务中表现出状态跟踪和规划能力不足，即使有外部验证器帮助也无法解决任何谜题，主要问题是脆弱的状态表示和弱启发式规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在没有代码执行或其他工具的情况下，进行规划和状态推理的能力，使用8拼图这一经典任务来精确评估。

Method: 测试四个模型在零样本、思维链、算法思维等提示条件下，以及分层纠正反馈和外部移动验证器辅助下的表现。

Result: 反馈提高了某些模型-提示组合的成功率，但成功运行通常冗长且计算昂贵。即使有外部移动验证器，所有模型都无法解决任何谜题。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在规划方面存在显著限制，需要开发维护显式状态和执行结构化搜索的机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive results on many benchmarks, yet their capacity for planning and stateful reasoning remains unclear. We study these abilities directly, without code execution or other tools, using the 8-puzzle: a classic task that requires state tracking and goal-directed planning while allowing precise, step-by-step evaluation. Four models are tested under common prompting conditions (Zero-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Algorithm-of-Thought) and with tiered corrective feedback. Feedback improves success rates for some model-prompt combinations, but many successful runs are long, computationally expensive, and indirect. We then examine the models with an external move validator that provides only valid moves. Despite this level of assistance, none of the models solve any puzzles in this setting. Qualitative analysis reveals two dominant deficits across all models: (1) brittle internal state representations, leading to frequent invalid moves, and (2) weak heuristic planning, with models entering loops or selecting actions that do not reduce the distance to the goal state. These findings indicate that, in the absence of external tools such as code interpreters, current LLMs have substantial limitations in planning and that further progress may require mechanisms for maintaining explicit state and performing structured search.

Abstract: AI/ML models have rapidly gained prominence as innovations for solving previously unsolved problems and their unintended consequences from amplifying human biases. Advocates for responsible AI/ML have sought ways to draw on the richer causal models of system dynamics to better inform the development of responsible AI/ML. However, a major barrier to advancing this work is the difficulty of bringing together methods rooted in different underlying assumptions (i.e., Dana Meadow's "the unavoidable a priori"). This paper brings system dynamics and structural equation modeling together into a common mathematical framework that can be used to generate systems from distributions, develop methods, and compare results to inform the underlying epistemology of system dynamics for data science and AI/ML applications.

Conclusion: 错误感知的多模态记忆对于终身和跨领域智能学习具有重要价值，ViLoMem框架有效提升了多模态推理的持续学习能力。

Abstract: MLLMs exhibit strong reasoning on isolated queries, yet they operate de novo -- solving each problem independently and often repeating the same mistakes. Existing memory-augmented agents mainly store past trajectories for reuse. However, trajectory-based memory suffers from brevity bias, gradually losing essential domain knowledge. More critically, even in truly multimodal problem-solving settings, it records only a single-modality trace of past behavior, failing to preserve how visual attention and logical reasoning jointly contributed to the solution. This is fundamentally misaligned with human cognition: semantic memory is both multimodal and integrated, preserving visual and abstract knowledge through coordinated but distinct representational streams. We thus introduce ViLoMem, a dual-stream memory framework that constructs compact, schema-based memory. It separately encodes visual distraction patterns and logical reasoning errors, enabling MLLMs to learn from their successful and failed experiences. Following a grow-and-refine principle, the system incrementally accumulates and updates multimodal semantic knowledge -- preserving stable, generalizable strategies while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Across six multimodal benchmarks, ViLoMem consistently improves pass@1 accuracy and substantially reduces repeated visual and logical errors. Ablations confirm the necessity of dual-stream memory with explicit distraction--hallucination separation, demonstrating the value of error-aware multimodal memory for lifelong and cross-domain agentic learning.
